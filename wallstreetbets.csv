Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use &gt;4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and negativity **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS sham company.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

(See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/) for my last missive to the community).

I want to check in because I’ve been getting confirmation privately that the hedge funds are hurting while publicly the news articles are saying they’re doing fine--my confidence in WSB’s power to upend the market with its collective power has gotten stronger.

That’s not why I’m writing now, though. I want to show you how the misinformation train keeps coming. Don’t get on.

First, here’s the funniest example of the media getting shit wrong I’ve seen in a while: on the [Bloomberg podcast The Tape](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE0yMjM2OTYwNDk1/episode/YTgzN2RkYzItNjBkYy0xMWViLTgzMzItMWJmNDg4Nzk1MGNm?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjwgpOM8sTuAhWTzTgGHbRDDVYQjrkEegQIDRAL&ep=6) on January 28, Kathy Burton, the hedge fund reporter for Bloomberg, discusses her piece on the trend dismissively by calling WSB a bunch of “Reddit bros” and saying WSB targeted several stocks Melvin Capital had shorted (not true--GME was the only target, and it was targeted because of its overall SI, not because of Melvin or its founder).

That’s not the worst part. The worst part is Burton repeatedly calls GME “Gameshop” (I’m not kidding, go to 26:40 in the podcast). If you’re going to report on a company, maybe get the company name right, k Kathy?

Now look at this post: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/blackrock-s-hildebrand-calls-short-squeeze-mania-some-nonsense. It’s fucking horseshit.

First, BlackRock and JPMorgan dismiss the trend as something that will come and go (they wish) and they blame the Federal Reserve (“It is not surprising when you think about how much liquidity is in the system, how much policy has fueled asset prices in recent weeks and months” is what Hildebrand, Vice Chairman of Blackrock said).

Now, Blackrock is a former client of mine, and I can say this because they’re no longer a client and I haven’t worked with them for years. **One of the worst stock picks and theses behind that stock pick I ever saw was from a portfolio manager at Blackrock who managed many billions of dollars**. Not everyone at Blackrock is bad (I’ve met some very smart people there), but not everyone is good. So even if someone at Blackrock dismisses GME in good faith, it doesn’t mean shit. But Hildebrand is talking in bad faith, clearly, because she wants higher interest rates so financial firms can lend money at higher rates. It’s very likely self-serving dishonesty.

Then there’s the fact that what he said isn’t even true. Money velocity remains at record low levels, indicating liquidity IN THE REAL ECONOMY is not high (unsurprising since QE is a very ineffective means of getting money into the hands of ordinary people--which is not the Fed’s fault, as that’s not really their job).

Plus, asset prices aren’t showing a bubbly tendency at all. Note how Hildebrand doesn’t address the fact that the Nasdaq 100 went down over 4% last week--hardly the sign of a stock market bubble. He’s full of shit.

That isn’t the worst part of this story.

Perhaps the most egregious example of how Wall Street is trying to spin this in their favor is Anne Richards, Fidelity International CEO, who said in an interview that the GME situation shows why there should be LESS transparency for shorting stocks. I’m quoting Bloomberg:

>“The thing that they could do very very quickly is remove the transparency on where the big shorts are, because that seems to be the trigger,” Richards said. “But then of course that takes away from that market transparency which everybody wanted to put in place after the financial crisis.”

She does NOT suggest that there should be MORE market transparency so that investors know how much a hedge fund shorts a stock and when it shorts, so that big shorts can’t accumulate and trigger an event like $GME mooning--no, the market needs LESS transparency, she says, so that retail investors can’t squeeze hedge funds.

This is obvious bullshit, and the fact that it went unchallenged on Bloomberg is a testament to how shoddy their journalism really is. Bloomberg has been the place that gave massive platforms to hucksters like Dennis Gartman, a newsletter writer who was a punchline on Wall Street--we would always say he’s the best contrarian indicator on the market, just do the opposite of what he does. Gartmen quit his newsletter in 2019, which cost thousands of dollars to subscribe to annually, after getting regular interviews on Bloomberg where he was treated as an expert for the unknowing public despite his appalling track record and constant failures.

Now Bloomberg is giving a platform to WS players who are trying to spin the story to deregulate the industry. Absolutely fucking unreal.

Or, well, it isn’t, really. I have seen this happen in my decade in the industry. I have seen mainstream news articles on reports I’ve written that get those reports exactly wrong. I remember one report in particular where the headline was ambiguous, but the report was very clearly positive on the stock for reason X. The news report from one outlet (possibly Bloomberg) said something like “Analyst bearish on stock for reason Opposite-of-X”. It was really funny, and since correcting the record wasn’t good for my employer’s business, we didn’t bother to. That’s just one of many examples of fuckery I have from the financial press, so this misinformation garbage does not surprise me one bit.

Tldr; read the whole post you lazy fuck. But if you can’t read, here’s the deal: the financial press’s activist misinformation campaign is getting more and more transparent.",wallstreetbets

What are they trying to say here? The government might get 12%-30% of my profits... okay? I'm still keeping 70%-88% of it? Last time I checked, 88% is more than 0%.

The title makes it seem like we're all idiots and it's not even worth making money in GameStop, because a *small* portion of the money goes to the government.

Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks. We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.

This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week. Notice how it says ""... this thing is happening in the next few days."" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks.

I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co-operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to ""normal levels"" (fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit). Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?

TL;DR

For everyone on here that can't read, I’ll keep it short & sweet. Some of you may know I’ve been long GameStop since 2017. We finally exceeded my fair market value, a goal I had always dreamed of. I sold \~95%. 🧻 🤚. Price has gone so far beyond my $169 bull case. The remaining 300 shares march onward to crush the Persian hedge funds in lockstep with those of you still fully strapped aboard the 🚀🚀 🚀 . I believe it is more likely than not we see a higher high.

WORDS:

We flew past it so quickly that I even managed to sell myself a meme-orable fill as I was taking profits. 🧻🖐🤦🏻‍♂️ compared to the immaculate /u/DeepFuckingValue—he has only trimmed while I am \~95% out. I will sell CSPs over the next weeks at prices I’m happy to invest at for the long term after the speculative mania subsides. I have 300 Spartan shares still standing tall at this point and wish for us to see true Valhalla—another sell at $690.69...and beyond. This is my goal now. One thing I always pride myself on is being transparent and honest. I want you all to know I took life changing profits—at least my paper and crayons taste good. Plus I can even buy fresh tendies and tip the tendieman! Cheers to all, and may more tendies cometh soon to all my fellow degenerates. -Rod

Freedom to Trade, Freedom to Choose Profession and Freedom of Association are protected by First Amendment, Ninth Amendment and the US Bill of Rights and so on. 

Hence, although RH might disclaim some liabilities, it cannot disclaim the most basic rights of its customers. As a broker, it is bestowed upon the rights by the state to sincerely HELP its customers buy and sell securities by charging some fees. But it cannot deny them trading securities for some random BS reasons.

So, we all remember the first attack on WSB last week, resulting in the sub going private for an hour so that the mods could get things under control.

If you recall, it was a pure numbers game. Insane amount of obvious bots with brand new accounts spamming tickers and 🚀 with no other actual content.

It was extremely easy to spot and report suspicious accounts. Mods took control quickly.

They have adapted. **Quickly**. The manipulation is currently much more sophisticated.

HFs underestimated individual investors and currently find themselves in a world of trouble. Do not make the same mistake they did. Consider the following:

&#x200B;

Every time you see a post that is ever so subtly guiding your attention away from GME, or has a general tone that the squeeze is basically over, or is giving good SI indicators about other potential squeezes etc, open their profile and do the following:

* **Posts**. Things to look for:

1. What were they posting about a few weeks ago. If its only topics unrelated to finance/investing➡️suspicious
2.  When was the last time they made a post before starting to post about GME/investing. If theres a time horizon greater than 2+ weeks between their usual activity and current GME squeeze posts➡️suspicious . 
3. *Telltale signs*: Account has a long history, posting about topics unrelated to finance and investing. Out of the blue, successive GME squeeze related posts. 

* **Comments**: 

1. Scroll through the comments to get a general sentiment and feeling of how “real” the account is. If they seem to be parroting a lot of GME squeeze related stances in great succession, followed once again by a time period cushion before their usual comments on other unrelated topics ➡️suspicious

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I will not repeat what everyone has heard and is already well aware of by now. We are in a historic event. The stakes are high. Huge sums are involved. Recognize the magnitude of the situation and approach every interaction with caution. Social media manipulation has been “solved” over the last decade, be constantly aware of that. Any information you read, always do your own research, on the topic and on the source itself.

And, of course GME 🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: In regards to the 2+ week time horizon between non finance topics and GME, that only applies to POSTS that are very confident in their advice. Obviously that doesn’t apply to comments. People have naturally gravitated from non finance topics to this historic event over the past few weeks(5m+ new members in a week says it all)",wallstreetbets

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",wallstreetbets

1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.
2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.
3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.
4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.
5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.
6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share
7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).
8. Wednesday morning: ""We Like The Stock"". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350
9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla
10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.
11. A Battle Cry is let out ""We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""
12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m
13. Here is where things get dark...
14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.
15. According to Justin Kan ""Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME""
16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.
17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.
18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.
19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share
20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.
21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company
22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.

WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD 🌎 


From the last few paragraphs of her January 29th report https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-29-2021



“The Democrats’ hand has likely been strengthened this week by the media frenzy over the so-called “GameStop short squeeze,” in which hedge fund managers got squeezed by ordinary investors driving up the price of the stock of a video game retailer so that the hedge funds could not cover short sales. Investment firms promptly cried foul, only to be greeted with derision, since it is not at all clear that their own stock purchases have a better effect on the markets than those of the smaller investors, and since they made huge money betting on the Covid-19 crisis. Observers see the short squeeze as a populist attack on unscrupulous Wall Street types.

While the entire story behind the short squeeze is not yet clear, it does already have a political meaning. The GameStop story reinforced the growing sense that the system has been rigged for the wealthy. People from across the political spectrum are demanding more thorough regulation of the stock market, a dramatic cultural change.”",wallstreetbets
241,"ALL HAIL OUR SUPREME AUTIST u/adioking, They single-handedly stopped the hedgecunts from flash crashing the stock.

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",wallstreetbets

420,Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total Shares,News,33645,l7q1et,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7q1et/robinhood_is_lying_you_are_blocked_acquiring_more/,1611918713.0,"Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.

I will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is a process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I do in the series of edits and comments I made in my original gains post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k\_590k\_in\_3\_months/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k_590k_in_3_months/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

If you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels amazing.

Also, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to ""$35k to $1.25M""?

I'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.

EDIT:

Let me try to answer some of the common questions.

I started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.

Hold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.

Go into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration

Learn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.

Learn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.

LET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.

Do not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.

Don't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.

LEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.

I'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.

EDIT 2:

I will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.

My education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.

EDIT 3:

I usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.

10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.

EDIT 4:

If you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one ""strategy"" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\~ or so from this.

But then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.

Learning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to ""outsmart"" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.

EDIT 6:

Almost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)

EDIT 7:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)

EDIT 8:

Let me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.

EDIT 9:

Many people seem to miss my points from the above giant ass retarded fucking post. So let me write another paragraph you can ignore. Hopping on the same trend is not enough. People pull out too soon, or worse they insist on going the wrong fucking direction. Even with my gains, I pulled out early on so so sooo many trades, with lost gains to the tune of approximately $3\~ mil by my rough estimate. Letting my winners run and not pulling out too quickly let me get some big wins. This was not something easy for me to do, I was always tempted to pull the plug early on my positions but I held most and relied on tight trailing stop losses.",wallstreetbets

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE: [better source](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/melvin-capital-management-lp) showing Melvin Capital’s puts on TSLA from 2016 through 2020
