Not that they are company *like* TSLA or that they will see similar returns.**

EDIT: BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CAN'T READ, BB IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A NEARLY TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY LIKE TESLA. The comparison is with a company that is undervalued because it's going to get in on a *brand new* market that it helps create.

---

BB has some elevated short interest for sure. That short interest may even be increasing. However the float on the stock is massive compared to GME. There are over 550 million available shares of BB, and the short interest is below 100%. While there may be some movement up based on shorts covering, GME is a once in a lifetime thing.

Nothing is the next GME. Not AMC, not NOK, not BB. The large players aren't ever going to be caught this way again in a place where retail investors can screw them, and GME isn't over. If what you want it to participate in that, then you should buy GME.

But I think BB is *fundamentally* more valuable than its current price.

## Current Situation of the Company

BlackBerry, which started as Research In Motion, was the ""original"" smartphone company, before Apple ate them alive. They didn't have the product pipelines or the money to compete against Apple, and the company was nearly killed by the iPhone and later the Samsung Galaxy brand.

Over the last several years, BlackBerry has pivoted into a software security company. They mainly sell security products with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

From Fidelity:

> BlackBerry Limited provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide. The company leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions in the areas of cybersecurity; safety and data privacy; and endpoint security management, encryption, and embedded systems.

Over the last year, BB has re-positioned itself to take advantage of the nascent market of autonomous and intelligent vehicles. (Source: [AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/))

> BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences as well as provide valuable product insights back to the manufacturer.

They also have a partnership with Baidu for that company's Apollo autonomous driving open platform. (Source: [BlackBerry Expands Partnership with Baidu to Power Next Generation Autonomous Driving Technology](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology))

> BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu, whose high-definition maps will run on the QNX® Neutrino® Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).
> 
> ...
> 
> The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu’s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.

Their QNX system is already used in over 100 million cars that are currently on the road, including a direct partnership with [Ford](https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22007012/blackberry-ford-extend-partnership-to-develop-car-software) that they've had since 2016.

They are in the final stages of completing an amazing turnaround as a company, and it looks like they have a good chance of doing it successfully. So what are the challenges?

## Balance Sheet Issues

BB has almost 2/3 of their current ""assets"" tied up in patents. This can be seen on their 2019 balance sheet as ""Intangible Assets – Total: $2.352 billion"". Their assets which are easier to liquidate are nearly exactly their current liabilities ($1.196 billion vs. $1.121 billion), as they added $638 million in debt in FY2019.

Just a few weeks ago, BlackBerry sold 90 of its smartphone patents to Huawei. It also signed a licensing deal with OnwardMobility and Foxconn to allow it's name and software to be used in making a new 5G Android-powered smartphone that has a physical keyboard, filling a small but important niche in the smartphone industry that is mostly untapped at this point.

These moves signal the intent of BlackBerry to leverage parts of its balance sheet that have been mostly sitting idle since 2016 when they exited the smartphone market for good as a manufacturer.

The challenge is that their cash flow and income have been negative or paltry for quite a while. That was never going to turn around until they were able to monetize some of their existing IP and position the company for a solid market segment. At this point, they have successfully done both.

## Earnings

This section definitely depends on your focus and perspective. For instance, BlackBerry's GAAP EPS has been negative more than positive since 2016. But on the other hand, their adjusted actual EPS has beaten consensus estimates for every single quarter going back to Q3 2015.

If you believe in Chen's ability to execute the turnaround, then this seems positive. If you think the company is destined for failure and a slow death, then this seems negative.

## Conclusions

Overall, I think BB is undervalued at its current price. They are very well positioned to take off as autonomous vehicles become more common, and most importantly, they have extremely valuable partnerships in many different markets, including some fantastic access to the Chinese market through their partnership with Baidu.

Autonomous vehicles are a market that doesn't exist yet. Not truly. But many people believe that autonomous vehicles are going to turn into a HUGE segment of the market over the next decade. While car companies (particularly TSLA) provide direct exposure to that, they come with manufacturing risks and other things such as supply-chain risks. TSLA, Toyota, Ford... they could all face issues that simply come down to ""we ran out of good suppliers of Cadmium"" or something similar, while what you want is exposure to autonomous vehicles.

BB has none of that. Their revenue and exposure to the market is entirely within the software, and because of their wide range of partnerships they shouldn't be dependent on any particular manufacturer. I expect to see them reporting positive earnings during FY2021 (though only slightly), and a much more obviously robust performance in FY2022.

Their patent portfolio alone in 2020 was worth about what their market cap was, that's how undervalued this company was due to concern about earnings. Once those earnings turn around, I think the valuation based on *only* fundamentals should put the stock at about $20 *right now*, and about $30-$35 by the end of this year.

There is also a non-trivial chance of a purchase by another company such as Alphabet that wants access to their partnerships, patent portfolio, and machine learning software.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. It is an organization of my own thinking behind the positions I have opened with my money.

Overall, BB benefits from its meme-stock status, and a bit of a short squeeze could happen for sure. But based just on my reading of their business itself, I think the stock has room to as much as triple within a year.

I know that everything happening right now is really exciting and makes you want to jump on the bandwagon, but please be careful.

Let me start by saying what we are seeing right now is NOT NORMAL. Like at all. Like this is never gonna happen again.

I think it's very concerning how many people are investing large sums of money into these stocks without knowing a single thing about investing. That is not investing. That is gambling. If you are okay putting a small portion of your net worth on GME, then by all means go for it. But you have to treat that money as if you have already lost it all. People are gonna get hurt by their wild optimism.

**ADVICE: Instead of dumping money into GME, start educating yourselves on the market and build good investing habits. Look into ETFs, mutual funds, growth stocks (start with VTI, VOO, SPY, QQQ, ARKK etc). Be consistent. Educating yourselves now will be way more helpful for your future than blindly investing in companies because Reddit said so.**

All in all I think its a good thing that the GME situation has more gotten people interested in investing, but I really worry that people will get in trouble by not learning the basics and jumping in the deep end with money they can't afford to lose. Please be smart.

Good luck everyone!",options

7,Practical and actionable ideas for next week -- AMC,,30,l8tr88,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8tr88/practical_and_actionable_ideas_for_next_week_amc/,1612035643.0," Woah. This week was awesome. This post is not about the implications of what the movement might mean. This post centers around my 2 cents for existing, available trading options for someone that wants to get their beak wet or have skin in the game (""I think he's mixing up metaphors""). I'll be focusing on AMC although the principles still apply to GME. I'll try to keep it short.

Quick background: I'm an engineer/quant developer. I like relying on statistics, probabilities, and juicy risk-to-reward trades. I normally sit out of these huge moves, but when i see opportunities that are overlooked, i'll take them. It also helps that I strongly believe in the continuing power shift from the hedge funds to the collective masses, and I would like to part of it.

I'll start with my conclusion: **2/5 AMC Call Debit Spreads** is one of the better available trades this week.

I trade options, I like having a set risk limit for each of my trades. However, when AMC is having 20-70% daily moves, the reward profile becomes less attractive for me. I think most people here are either buying naked options or shares. I think the risk profile for shares is more or less understood, so let's focus on naked calls.

Let's look at this example for a $13 ITM Weekly Call: [https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9](https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9)

Because the volatility is so high, AMC would have to move 35% by end of week, just for this contract to break even. One could argue that that is a strong case to be selling premium, and they could be right, but it doesn't fit my personal criteria for having a set risk limit for each trade. The downside for selling AMC premium this week is potentially high and, also, how dare you.

Let's compare this to the $12/$13 Call Debit Spread i took on Friday (and there will most likely be similar trades available this upcoming week): [https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq](https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq)

As we can see, the opposite is true. We actually gain value every day that the price holds. I edited the values for the entry because i was able to get filled at $0.20 on Friday, so i'm looking at a 400% gain if AMC closes above 13. Furthermore, my risk is capped at the debit I paid for these spreads.

One of the other benefits is that a naked ITM $13 call will run you > $500 a contract, while the spread was $20 bucks a pop.

Again, this isn't financial advice, just my 2 cents. I'm normally an algo trader with a quant bias, and its hard to model what might happen this week, but I wanted to be on the side of the community while also potentially making a good trade. All this to say, I'm proud of you all. Hope we can hold the line. Cheers.",options

Curious what r/options thinks of potential for these stocks in the next couple weeks.  I’m holding calls on each a couple months out and like many of us was having a grand old time until Thursday, we all know what followed.

I’ve read all the DD on BB and their array of patents and think it has great long potential so I expect a lot of buyers to come in on this if it dips further and volume is still our friend on this one.  AMC is kind of a “fingers crossed for another gamma squeeze” play, I don’t believe there is still enough % short of float to cause GME movement but I’d be very happy if they saw even a fraction of that kind of momentum.  NOK was not the greatest trade I’ve entered into amidst all this but I don’t believe it’s a classic “pump & dump” like some here have said either, they do have a stake in the 5G revolution and I could also see large positions being entered into if it dips back down to pre-GME week levels.",options

10,$GME run is stalling - $QQQ calls to inverse,,42,l8r13t,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8r13t/gme_run_is_stalling_qqq_calls_to_inverse/,1612028654.0,"tldr: factors that drove the $GME run were short squeeze, massive volume buying, value story, and gamma squeeze. All factors are now more limited.

I could be wrong but here's my sense of the situation (none of this is investment advice of course)

1. **Shorts in the market have entered at decent prices** - short borrow rates for $GME were still 30%+ all week which means that as some shorts exited to cover, others were clamoring to get in. Especially with the Thursday dip, the shorts in place are in a comfortable position in terms of squeeze pressure. 140% short interest two weeks ago is different from 120-140% short interest now because of entry prices. Interest levels are high so there is that pressure though

2. **GME is just too expensive** - even without brokerage restrictions, most retail won't be able to afford to risk more than a few shares and institutions aren't going to risk buying at these levels in a game of chicken. It's one thing to buy a few hundred shares at $10/share, it's another at $300/share. And whatever legit value story is likely gone - most value story ranges were probably capped at $30-$90.

3. **Options are juiced and gamma squeeze potential is gone** - there's no delta hedging needed when massive volatility is priced into premium. An expiring 1/29 $500 call yesterday morning was an insane $500+/contract - you now neither have the volume of calls necessary nor the volatility potential to trigger a massive gamma squeeze.

In short, the drivers of the GME run are more limited and it's hard to see what is going to drive more squeeze. Notably, these 3 interact meaningfully (e.g., cheap GME => retail can buy more and more likely to be underpriced options => more likely to gamme squeeze after a big run up => hits shorts that entered at cheap prices forcing them to cover) - with all 3 deflated, there's less of a feedback loop as well.

The answer? $QQQ has been inversely related to the high short stock runs - probably driven by systematic risk fears, but also because long tech / short B&M retail has been a popular HF strategy. 

$GME puts are hella expensive so just going $QQQ calls might be a decent proxy to inverse although there's probably no free lunch out there either way. Probably a call spread",options

14,"VIX, Vega Risk, and the GME Situation",,8,l8yuk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8yuk9/vix_vega_risk_and_the_gme_situation/,1612049602.0,"Wednesday saw VIX increased some 60% in a single day. For those who doesn't know, VIX is computed from the implied volatilities of SPX options ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp)). My thoughts are market is really afraid that the GME (and AMC, BBBY, BB, KOSS, and others) situation may pose a systemic risk to the stock market.

Now that the ""short squeeze"" situation stabilizes somewhat, VIX is actually calming down a little bit (on Thursday and Friday, VIX roughly traded within range of Wednesday), even though the broader market just dropped another 2% on Friday.

How does this apply to r/options? Well, options IV is somewhat correlated to VIX, not 100% correlated, but not 0% either (this like saying a particular stock is somewhat correlated to the SPY). For people who sell options prior to Tuesday, they would have gotten absolutely slaughtered on Wednesday (I checked a couple Feb strangles on SNAP and PINS entered on Monday, they were up 50% on Wednesday, even though no breach of the strikes had happened). For people who longed options on Wednesday, they paid a little more premiums than usual, and when VIX dropped the next day, the gains would be smaller than typical even if the assumption on the underlying was correct. 

At this point, I don't have a guess where VIX will go next week. If the ""short squeeze"" situation continues, we may see another round of IV explosion, the stock market sell off doesn't seem done either, so that is another risk factor. Right now, I like to have my option portfolio who I call ""vega neutral"" (it is not beta weighted, so not very precisely neutral), say about positive 40 vega. I assigned about a 50% correlation with my portfolio's IV with VIX, so if VIX drops one point, I say about -$20 PnL if everything stays the same). I achieve vega neutral by by having a mix of long options, short iron condors, long calendar spreads, and short call spread. I basically long vega when the underlying IV (I used IV percentile over the last year) is low and short vega when IV is high. Hopefully, this coupled with a slightly better than 50-50 shot of getting the underlying direction correct and risk management, I can see some gains this coming week.",options

Without turning this into a political or class discussion, we should be mindful of what the steps taken by brokerages and clearing houses means for stocks and options valuation.

By placing restrictions on trade, the demand side of the equation is being suppressed, and the effects of this can be seen in the massive volatility of both stocks AND options pricing.

Whether you're opening an options position or buying shares outright, the restriction is going to impact your trade depending on the developments in the coming weeks. This means a mispricing of risk premiums in options; there may be higher risk lurking down the road ahead that may not be priced in.

I inherited some money and ultimately I want to invest part of it in ETFs/big names like msft/aapl. Does it make sense to write naked puts with roughly 1-month to maturity instead of buying directly?

I am planning to write ~2 std puts. For single names I will avoid earning seasons. I will cover each put written with 100x strike. So I do not want to use leverage by margin just to limit assignment risks.

My reasoning is that I would buy the underlying anyways. If it drops and I get asigned I would buy the dip automatically. In addition, I would earn a nice premium of roughly 15% p.a. until assignment.

Are there any hidden risks I have not considered?",options

Everyone during the weekend is awaiting for their funds to transfer in their new account. Once, Monday bell comes everyone will want to long gamestop, amc, etc. Many firms are taking advantage of these publications that are occurring in social media. The pump is not necessarily being create by WSB, but they are creating the leverage for other firms.

How do you decide on a good time to sell? The longer they go the more potential for upside.  However, if they get closer to January 2021 then they present even less value to potential buyers and less theta. I also I have 2000 actual shares and it would be a good idea to add more shares.

There is no denying the fact that the premiums on GME are absolutely juicy. Look, I don't want to be those stupid hedge funds writing naked short calls to pocket premium on their short positions. 

I WANT TO BE SMARTER, so, what if I buy 100 shares of gamestop on Monday and sell a covered call every week until I get my shares called or sell premium until I break even? Ideally, I would sell a very aggressive short call, I would sell something like a .60 delta. If my shares get called away, oh well, I made money on the way up. If not, I will keep selling calls until they get called away. Worse comes to worst, I get stuck and have to sell premium until I get my money back and more.

Can someone explain why this wouldn't work? I am aware that gamestop could tank and I would lose on the shares. But if this trades sideways or goes up to 1k I would pocket the premium and also make over 100% on the shares.

Yes, I am an idiot and I likely shouldn't have done any of this. I feel like there is no coming back from the first 4 calls.  I got in on a few other calls as you can see from the photo (FB & MSFT) but I'm a tad more hopeful about them.

The reason why I got into the latter 2 calls from Friday's drop is due to thinking that a rebound has to be within short-reach due to the liquidation of the stock to cover the shorts, but also from others looking to unload and throw it all in on the GME short squeeze. Further, I figured the dividend day being on 2/5 might be some form of a catalyst for the rebound. After the monstrous quarter AAPL just had, I was hard-pressed to think that this liquidation sale will be persistent. With that in mind, getting in the green wouldn't be very much work. I can still see this crashing down to 123-124 and not recovering for multiple months as well though. 

I don't know what I don't know at this point and have been getting wrecked overall as many others. Breaking even after all of this feels like a dream. Any thoughts? Thanks all.

71,How is a Covered Call equivalent to a Short Put?,,0,l8u1uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8u1uu/how_is_a_covered_call_equivalent_to_a_short_put/,1612036359.0,"It makes even less sense to me when the put is far out of the money. 

Example: GME

$25 strike put currently at $0.83

$25 strike call currently at $304.78

If I sell the put, I get $83. Collateral $2,500.

If I buy 100 shares at spot price, $312.01, it'll cost $31,201 for collateral. 

$31,201 - (304.78\*100) = $723 in net credit, but you're almost guaranteed to get assigned because GameStop will never go down, diamond hands. You keep $723, but lose the difference between stock price and strike price, let's say it reaches $400. So ($400 - $25)\*100 = $37,500. You got $723 in credit and lost $37,500 so you lose $36,777. How is this equivalent to getting $83 from the put? Is my math wrong?

Conversely, if the stock goes to $24, the put is assigned.
In the same circumstance, the call is not assigned and you get to keep $30,478 in premium - $28,801 = $1,677. Which is way more than the put makes if assigned.",options

The last part is ok, but within the three minths I could not get anyone to take my calls of my hands, even setting a price was hard as no options traded. Underlying stock was fine.  
2) ITM calls at the end of the period - could not sell them, had to exercise them with the added pains of the liquidity needed to do so.

75,Knock-out certificates equivalent to margin investing?,,4,l8juhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8juhw/knockout_certificates_equivalent_to_margin/,1612006343.0,"To those Europeans out there who have access to knock-out certificates (turbo open end options), I was wondering if you could help me with my thinking.

I have seen some KO products out there for specific indexes (e.g., DAX, DOW, Nasdaq 100) and to me, they seem like an ideal way to make a diversified investment with some leverage (I am thinking about 2x or 3x). 

Would using the KO certificates for an ETF for a long term hold be equivalent to margin investing in those ETF? The KO price seems to me to be equivalent simply to a margin call -- but because they are traded securities and no margin call by the issuer is possible, the knock-out kicks in; this seems to me to be fair. So, can I think of these two way of investing (KO certificates and margin purchases) as equivalent?

I ask because KO certificates seem mostly to be used by day traders. But, at least with HSBC, the per annum interest rate is fantastic (around 3% p.a. at the moment). And, assuming the markets go up 8-10% p.a., with 2x leverage, I think the gains should be pretty good (like 13% - 17%?).

As everyone knows, $GME has been causing quite a bit of news lately.  There has been a huge buying frenzy for $GME shares along with a handful of other companies.  On Thursday, Robinhood restricted purchasing $GME shares and options citing liquidity issues.  By Thursday evening, Robinhood acquired 1 billion in additional funding and announced that they were allowing limited purchases of $GME stock and option contracts.  This turned out to be 5 shares and 5? contracts of $GME.

On Friday, by midday, Robinhood restricted GME share purchases to 1.  Shortly before market closing, this thread r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/ was posted by u/adioking.  He basically posted that you could buy a Feb5 $0.50 C contract and immediately exercise the contract giving you 100 shares. 
 There was a lot of downward pressure on GME prior to this post.  $GME ended up closing above 320 which was great because all call options 320 and lower ended itm. 

Friday evening, after market close, Robinhood announced trading restrictions on 50 stocks https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-restricts-gamestop-stock-trading-23-companies-app-2021-1

I believe buying and exercising $GME Feb5 call contracts directly caused Robinhood to put limits on other high volume stocks due to liquidity issues.  That said, I really don't know what I am talking about.  Thoughts?

There doesn’t seem to be any articles, videos out there that get very explicit on what you can lose

Here is my understanding:

1. Buying a Call (Buying to Open) - max loss is the total amount you paid for the contract only, meaning your max loss is LIMITED.
Example: if the call contract cost $1,000 with a strike price of $50 and the stock only ever reaches $49 upon expiration date....your max loss is $1,000


Selling to close option on this contract:

1A. Sell before expiration (for unlimited profit or max loss of $1,000)

1B. Exercise option before expiration (buy the contract and pay stock price for 100 shares)

1C. Contract expires worthless for max loss of $1,000


2. Buying a Put (Buying to Open) - max loss is the total amount you paid for the contract only, meaning your max loss is LIMITED.
Example: if the out contract cost $500 with a strike price of $30 and the stock only dips to $35 upon expiration date....your max loss is $500


Selling to close option on this contract:

2A. Sell before expiration (for unlimited profit or max loss of $500)

2B. Exercise option before expiration (buy the contract and pay stock price for 100 shares)

2C. Contract expires worthless for max loss of $500


3. Selling a Call (Selling to Open aka Writing a Call) - Max Loss is UNLIMITED (you could lose $800 Million dollars for a crude example) 
Example: You sell a call and the buyer on the other side decides to exercise this option. You now must pay the buyer whatever the current price of stock is, which could be -4000% of what it originally was when you wrote the contract.


4. Selling a Put (Selling tonOpen aka Writing a Put) - Max Loss is UNLIMITED (you also lose $800 Million dollars for crude example purposes)
Example: You sell a Put and the buyer on the other side decides to exercise this option. You must pay the buyer whatever the current price of stock is (multiplied by 100 shares if it’s only 1 contract), which could be +2,000% of what the stock price originally was when you wrote the contract.

We got a nice little tweet from [@WSBgod](https://twitter.com/WSBgod):

[Educate Yourself](https://twitter.com/WSBgod/status/1355004490122887168?s=20) It is pretty hard to read but well worth it. Love learning more about Burry!

## Here is a short summary:

Short squeeze makes a frenzy of buying. Actors with no position buy because the stock is running high and want to get in on big gains. Actors with short positions, those that short sold the stock, will hedge against their short positions by buying stock. Eventually it will be time for the actors with short positions to pay up. They will get a margin call from the prime broker. When they can't pay, the debit will fall to the prime broker. This debt will then be shared by many prime brokers.

What happens when we get some debt among all the hedge funds? Well they will need to sell many of their positions. We saw the start of this today. Many big name stocks with good evalutions selling off. So you can short whatever you like and it will probably be good going forward for the near/medium term.

Let's look at $SPY

Here we see a big red candle, bearish engulfing. We have also bounced off the trendline. RSI is also showing lower highs starting at the high back in 2018, then another bounce in 2020. Also the squeeze momentum chart also shows lower high momentum. We should keep an eye on the 325 level where we saw support previously.

Here is another person I like to follow on Twitter, [@mtmalinen](https://twitter.com/mtmalinen) also sounding [rather bearish lately](https://twitter.com/mtmalinen/status/1354788065634643972?s=19). He points to some different concerns about debt around Europe and US. Not a good sign for markets.

4. [$TD](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-TD/)

I personally like the puts on $ICE, here is the [chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICE/options?p=ICE). The IV has not exploded so options on this are still cheap relative to other things out there. IV is in the 30% range here. The volume isn't the greatest but $ICE has more volume than $AMG. Which is why I like $ICE better than $AMG. Also just sounds great to have some whisky on $ICE baby!

The restriction of trading this week, and especially the options restrictions fucking shot the momentum in the balls. “Buy the fucking dip” - warren buffet. yolo on FD's like a fucking a champ. 

by restricting GME late last week, Gamma ramp was fucking kneecapped. Part of what drove the early week action was the fact that every single GME call in existence was ITM. MM's had to delta hedge 100 shares for every single call that existed.  that obviously sent price to the fucking moon. This week however they will be unwinding A LOT of shares since the same effect did not occur, because they were playing fuck fuck games. based on open interest I expect there will be more net selling in the unwind vs. buying from put winds. Hence I expect a dip. Note I said dip, not collapse.

The collapse is backstopped by you retards HODLing shares. it will come at some point. not yet though. for the inevitable to be avoided though upward momentum has to be SOLIDLY re-established. Now we dont know what other tricks they have in store for us this week, but rest assured they will be used and they will make up new shit. to refuel the rocket though Gamma does need to ramp again. thats where our favorite FD's come in. 2/5 and 2/12 volume is gonna be a big determining factor if it is to be reclaimed.

So if Robinhood goes under the SEC will freeze all the accounts. The SIPC protects up to $500k in accounts. It takes months to unwind and get your money back. Move the money now. This could become a nightmare. Robinhood is dealing with the classic run on the bank scenario. Everyone wants out but they can’t process it fast enough depleting needed capital as fast as they can get new VC Capital in. So they need to put up more margin and they are losing Capital out the door. I’ve seen many huge firms go under including one I worked with, AIG. It was AAA rated Dow stock at the time.

[S3 partners: GME short interest at 113%](https://mobile.twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219) 

[WSB will not allow me to post since I’m less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]

I love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here’s why:

There were 50M trades yesterday. Retail investors couldn’t buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys yesterday, that’s 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.

Does that mean the price won’t go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it’ll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who’ll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who’ve likely already exited their positions.

This is all theory. I hope I’m proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don’t think they’d want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.

Welcome your thoughts. But please don’t pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people’s money is at stake here.

PS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I’m prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.

PS2: Please get the hell out of Robinhood. Those sellouts built their business on us retail investors and they’ve sold us out to their hedge fund buddies. Democratizing trading my ass.",options

I don't think it's any coincidence that the current price is hovering around $320.  If I had to make a retarded guess, I'd say it's being ever so slightly manipulated to hover here.

I am not very familiar with the behind the scenes details of options and I have some concerns about a potential for a large number of retail bag holders. If an OTM call becomes close to or in the money it is my understanding that the broker is forced to purchase the underlying. It is also my understanding that the goal of WSB was to prevent them from actually doing this but I am seeing a lot of talk about these short sellers having already covered, at least for today.

If that is true, and they actually did cover, everyone just moves on to the next week to again try to squeeze the short sellers into a position to not be able to cover their shorts.  It is also my understanding there is no place to see daily or real time the short percentage. Is that true?

If the brokers were not able to cover the shorts that expired ITM today they would be forced to buy them next week, creating a squeeze?

Now for the big question, if 100% of the float is shorted and 30% of the shorted stock expired today the brokers would have give those shares to the people that exercised? If those shares have been handed over there would now be 70% of the stock shorted and 30% more people looking to sell their shares to the broker to fill the 70% remaining shorted? If this is true I foresee an every man for himself scenario and a lot of retail bag holders in the near future, which saddens me due to the number of YOLO posts posted  over on WSB.

125,Trending stocks: buy right away or sell cash secured puts?,,6,l86ms6,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l86ms6/trending_stocks_buy_right_away_or_sell_cash/,1611960245.0,"Seeing how implied volatility is through the roof on the trending stocks that are being talked about on the news (AMC, GME, BB, NOK), why don't people lower their risk and sell cash secured puts instead of buying stocks at market price? AMC for example, you can sell 14 DTE puts at $10 strike and you get $400 in premium for every contract, with IV being at 600%+. That's 40% return on investment!!!

Now there could be two scenarios, where you both win from:

* If AMC goes to the moon -> you miss on it BUT you get juicy premium and easy 40% ROI.
* If AMC loses value -> you're forced to buy AMC BUT you'll enter at $6/share, which is a really good entry, instead of buying right now at $12-$15 market price.

Why don't people do this with every stock that they wanna get into? You can legit buy these with half the market price if you're smart and sell high IV options.

Now you could say that they're losing on potential earnings if AMC moons BUT couldn't you sell far OTM puts to make sure you get exercised to buy the stocks? 

14 DTE $30 strike gives you $2100 in premium, that's 70% ROI and you either pocket quick $2100 or you get a $9 entry price. 

And you only need a buying power of (strike price - premium) which is $600-$900 in this case, depending which strike price you choose.

The vaccine is effective in preventing 85% of severe CVOID cases and 100% effective in preventing hospitalization & death. This is a single dose vaccine and can be stored in a normal fridge. So I am not sure what else we should have expected from a single-dose vaccine. Even the overall efficacy of 66-72%  is way above the efficacy of the flu vaccine. Am I missing something or people were just expecting the 95% efficacy claimed by Moderna and others? JNJ is still doing the double-dose trial and that may show a  much higher efficacy as Moderna and other vaccines show a much lower efficacy than JNJ if only one dose is administered.

I started small on RH with 5k  and small deposits monthly and built it up to 15k. With Schwab, I was disappointed to find out I was unable to open an uncovered call position for on a limit order because I didn’t have enough money in my account. Essentially I would have needed >25k balance on this particular trade ($F). Explanation of Schwab rules in link below. 

To save me from opening a bunch of accounts with various brokers and testing each one, can someone tell me which brokers allow uncovered calls with no minimum cash balance other than the price of the contracts and commission? I’d also like to have better research ability for instance- premium/IV/Greeks history over time. Ability to trade paper in a test environment would also be great but not a deal breaker. Ideally I’d also transfer my IRA there as well to keep everything consolidated in one account which would be in a long term balanced portfolio of stocks/bonds.

130,Can I earn a small premium on a stock I plan to hold for a long time by selling puts?,,0,l8ffen,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8ffen/can_i_earn_a_small_premium_on_a_stock_i_plan_to/,1611986946.0,"Say I plan to hold 100 shares of MEOW for a long time(as a value investor).

&#x200B;

Assume MEOW is trading at $100, and I sell a cash covered put at $90.

Would I be able to make effectively risk free premium on this put by hedging the risk of assignment, and selling my 100 shares of MEOW if price drops below $90(with the intention canceling out the effect of the assignment)

&#x200B;

\---

Edit: really appreciate all the feedback. I should clarify my question with an example:

&#x200B;

Portfolio 1: I buy 100 shares of MEOW at $100 and plan to hold it forever

Portfolio 2: I buy 100 shares of MEOW at $100, and sell 1 cash put with a strike price of $90 and for $5, at the same time I sell the put, I place a $90 limit sell order for 100 shares of MEOW

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: MEOW goes up to $200 - in this case the gains are the same and the option expire and I make an extra $500 from the premium

&#x200B;

Scenario 2: MEOW goes down to $80. 

Portfolio 1 is just down $2000

In this case the limit order hits and my MEOW are sold at $90, at some point I would get assigned and buy back 100 shares of MEOW. So in effect I am still holding 100 shares of MEOW which is down $2000, but in this case I made $500 in premium

&#x200B;

Conclusion: in both cases, in the end I have 100 shares of MEOW(either in profit or loss but the same), but Portfolio 2 is just net up $500 of premium. Am I correct conclude that for any stock I plan to buy and hold, I can use the opportunity to make risk free returns as long as I have some extra cash on the side?

Robinhood released the limits and restrictions on the shares you can buy, and even HOLD. If you already own more than 10 GME option contracts, you are out of luck. It is pretty restrictive and crazy... here is the info from RH to make smart decisions today 😉

Are there limits to increasing my existing positions?
Yes. The table below shows the maximum number of shares and options contracts to which you can increase your positions. Please note that these are aggregate limits for each security and not per-order limits, and include shares and options contracts that you already hold. These limits may be subject to change throughout the day.

   

Symbol	Shares	Options contracts
AAL	55	50
AMC	115	100
BB	65	100
BBBY	30	50
CTRM	1650	N/A
EXPR	200	100
GME	5	10
KOSS	25	N/A
NAKD	750	N/A
NOK	110	100
SNDL	1200	100
TR	25	50
TRVG	400	100
 
 

What if my existing positions already exceed the limits?
If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.",options

I dont tend to try to explain my investment theories / strategies / ideas too much; Years back I really appreciated [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) as I was learning and so to those, old and new, I feel like I have to say this.

The videogame store stock itself is unimportant (and i mean, ofc. It's fn a b+m business that sells digital content). So are any other tickers that are blowing up right now. What is important is that retail traders for the first time have actually had an effect on the market that was so significant that all the establishment basically had to go code brown and pull out their hail-mary's like completely blocking trading on the app they know is probably (actually, no, they (hedge funds etc.) know FOR SURE - because they've been buying robin hoods data). Shit that is in a super gray area legally and could EASILY be construed as clear market manipulation if you can prove some ties between RobinH and hedge funds, etc.

This isn't about M\*\*\*n. This isnt about any short selling firm in general. They're a blip. What has Wall Street scared is that this is unprecedented and represents the \*chance\* for a change in power and influence over the market that has never been seen. Wall St fat cats have been making easy, safe money for years off the riskier trades of retail traders (or, I should say maybe, the inherently-more risky trades necessary when one doesnt have billions to work with). One, two, five hedge funds going out of business IS NOT THE CONCERN.

THIS IS THE CONCERN - We've been seeing a widening wealth gap and opportunity for income and social mobility has been shrinking and shrinking as a great divide has formed between the elite and the average person. Anyone with a brain knows that doesnt work for ever - at some point people dont have any more to give (or lose), people are out of patience, people get hungry, people get angry. That spread cannot continue. THIS MOVEMENT OF LETS GET TOGETHER AS RETAIL TRADERS, TALK TO EACH OTHER, REALIZE WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM - that could be the GREAT EQUALIZER that we have been needing for years as the US economy becomes more and more slanted in one direction (ie, the mega-rich).

THAT, my friends, is why we've seen such a strong reaction. The system the elite has built is not made to handle the masses all uniting for a cause. Look, I know this might sound a bit extreme, but how do you think any civil (or not so civil) revolution has ever come about? It's the populace getting sick of the manipulation of the top minority and exercising the sheer force of their numbers.

Even better, this is a war of DOLLARS not of knives, guns, and blood. The US military-industrial complex cant just stop this revolution. This has the potential to really, swiftly, re-distribute wealth in America based on MERIT rather than family history. The American dream is that this a meritocracy where those who think right and do shit right get ahead. Nothing about the G\* short squeeze plan is stupid. But we saw serious resistance yesterday thanks to the actions of brokerages and the general wall street establishment.

I know [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) gets a lot more old school traders that have probably seen this or that fad come and go. I've been watching WSB and related stuff for a few years now thinking about what sort of power it could end up generating. We're getting the first glimpse.

Not only do people with big positions kinda need this to not just fizzle out - we all need it to keep going because otherwise, the status quo will remain until it does come to some sort of violent revolution down the line. In the past 15 min I've seen articles from the likes of Mark Cuban basically saying the same thing.

I'm not saying buy into G\* - thats of course pretty crazy at $100+ a share, and that's your choice based on your risk tolerance and what part you want to play - but dont dismiss this and side with the establishment, because they're covering their asses. What I'm saying is that if, as the ""meme stocks"" start adding newer tickers to their lists based off what's closed, and the same shit keeps happening, I dont know what proof more you need that this IS IN FACT getting to the establishment. Or look at some hedge fund managers cry on the news about the damn kits on the internets. They are outdated. They're resting on their (not well-deserved) laurels. MONEY drives the modern world and has been the tool of the ruling elite for years. Even if nobody makes money on this shit, showing how superficial and stupid some of these constructs are - and how vulnerable to any coordination - is proving a very important point about the power of the people, thanks to online trading apps the the establishment themselves developed, thinking, ""Let's get more stupid retail traders for more dumb free money"".

So, in short - screw them. Whether here or ws bets, love your fellow retail traders and don't let this same shit that's been happening for years happen in such an extreme and obvious way. I dont have the total solution here - but we are on the brink of the possibility of a HUGE economic disruption that could turn the 1% into the 25% in a few weeks. That seem like a bull-case scenario for it? Sure. But it's not impossible. I just hope people understand the magnitude of this. It's definitely the biggest thing on the market since the housing crisis, and quite possibly the dot-com bubble or even the crash of 29. It's significant. Please dont just dismiss it as dumb kids on the meme-forum. Those dumb kids really caught on to something.

(Sorry, mods, I'm definitely not trying to ask an FAQ nor get around spam filters.

154,How do European options work when a company gets taken over before contract expiration?,,1,l8byac,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8byac/how_do_european_options_work_when_a_company_gets/,1611974996.0,"Hey guys

I have my eyes set on a potential Japanese takeover candidate and I've been researching how to trade options. Needless to say the pricing is pretty straight forward but the market is VERY thin from what I can tell. Is it safe to say brokerages in Japan just don't do a lot of call/put trading?

I think I have it pretty much figured out now though - Osaka only permits futures trading \~8 months out and that too as a European call option. Nothing I've read suggests I can go any further out even though I'd love to have a 2-year horizon on this - it would be well worth the premium IMHO.

My question (as the subject says), is what happens if this company gets bought out? Or if they sell a part of the company and treat it as a special dividend or spin it out and give stock in the spin out to existing shareholders - as an option holder (that too European-style), am I just basically out of luck?

I suppose we can break down the possible scenario in three categories:

1. Whole company gets acquired before September - what happens then? If the acquirer is a private company or a foreign company - how is this settled? Does the expiration get moved up or does it turn into an American-style option at that point and I can convert my position?
2. Company spins out a subsidiary or sells a subsidiary and issues a special dividend or gives proportional stock for shareholders - basically am I out of luck since I'm not entitled to that? BTW as I understand it, Asian companies are known to do this (bonus shares, etc. for existing shareholders).
3. Company spins out and allows outside investor(s) to invest in this spinout company but dilutes their own holding down to 50% for example - this is the scenario I'm least concerned about since the company is still owned by the parent, just diluted

Also two more slightly related questions:

1. Is there any way to trade American-style options on Japanese equities or at least their corresponding ADRs? Please correct me if I'm incorrect. It seems like Japan is decades behind in terms of trading mechanisms and derivatives.
2. Do I actually need to convert the European option at the end of the contract or can I straight up just trade the contract and get something close to the same as a conversion?",options

158,MM's may be unable to write new contracts tomorrow.,,134,l7cqnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l7cqnq/mms_may_be_unable_to_write_new_contracts_tomorrow/,1611877337.0,"So first, market markers are generally not part of these momentum moves. They generally don't have a stake in things either way.

What MM's do with regards to options, for anyone unfamiliar, is they write brand new options contracts. Calls and puts. They are, generally, the ones who are setting the bids and asks on the strikes you look at.

Yes, individual investors can and do write options, but it's very rare for individual investors to write naked options, which are necessary for people to have long options positions. There has to be a counter-party to the contract that is taking the opposite side.

How they do this is by acquiring a combination of securities that offset the delta and gamma of the contract they have written. As the price goes up and the contract gains a higher delta, they must acquire more of these securities. 

These securities can be some forms of insurance and derivatives, but the easiest and most common way for MM's to hedge their delta and gamma on a contract is to buy a portion of the underlying. As the price goes up, they must buy more to offset the greeks, as it goes down they sell. This allows them to remain price neutral.

At least a part of what happened today with Robinhood, WeBull, and IB is that the MM's those platforms use ran out of stock. Nobody was selling, the MM's ran out of stock, and thus the platforms could not fulfill buy requests. 

The brokers that stayed open for business had access to more of the existing stock, such as Fidelity and to a lesser extent TDA.

Tomorrow though, we may run out of stock, and people may be unwilling to sell. In that situation, there is no reliable way for MM's to hedge delta and gamma against new contracts, and it's possible that *options* markets may see a liquidity problem on these tickers for new contracts. 

Nearly 25% of all GME stock in existence expires tomorrow ITM if the stock is above $500, to give a scope of the issue.

This will probably happen at the same time that some of the short sellers are attempting to further cover their positions.

Pay attention to some of these tickers, we are likely to see some never-before-seen events in options markets tomorrow.

NOTE: BB has a much larger float and less total activity, so it's unlikely to run into this issue, but there could be spill over because of how correlated some of these trades have become among retain investors.",options
159,Today is the day to buy cheap end of month options on NASDAQ tickers.,,4,l80353,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l80353/today_is_the_day_to_buy_cheap_end_of_month/,1611944996.0,"For those interested, here's why this is a great day.

First, I hope you're familiar with the concept of max-pain, and today is the essence of max-pain trying to kill off every written option to maximize returns.

For example, this is a [list of FB calls expiring today](https://ibb.co/YWBKzFk), nearly 57,000 options with rights on 5.7m shares. Every last call owner until 250 will be massacred today, a good thing if you wrote 275 (covered or naked) calls a few weeks ago instead of buying them.

Then here is the [same story with FB puts](https://ibb.co/8zgsFgs), with nearly 40,000 of them being massacred out in the open. The max pain area for FB for the day will be between 250 and 257, the lower it goes, you should pick up any option expiring next month or later.

The story is the same for AAPL, AMD, and MSFT where everyone is getting slaughtered regardless of their position's side. For AAPL the max pain area seems to be $130 to $131, AMD's is $87-$88, and anything above $88C or below $87P is well butchered. MSFT's max pain is around $230 to $235, anything above $235C and below $230P is wrecked. Again, puts will be up today, there is no doubt about it given the market bleed, but they are only up relative to yesterday.

I can see us trading for the rest of day within those thresholds, and personally, it's a great time to pick up cheap calls for FEB. I welcome all criticism and thoughts... also, not financial advice.

**Positions:**

1. AAPL 3x $150C FEB 26 @ $1.6
2. FB 5x $300C FEB 26 @ 1.9

i've had a couple theories about this but the one that makes the most sense is the commission is the small cut the brokers gets for being the middle man, not the amount i pay to the other investor on the other end of this contract. i thought maybe the $414 is the amount owed for entering the contract, but i played with the numbers and the difference between the current price and the strike price adds up to this $414 which made me question if this is the amount owed to enter the contract or the amount realized if i exercise my right to the contract at the strike price.

Hello,

I bought 100 shares of stock X for $9.77. I wrote a covered call with a strike price of $5 for $500 premium with a breakeven price of $10 that expires in 21 days.

So as long as the stock stays below $10 I should be able to keep all the premium and the shares correct? Or am I fucked and need the price to drop below $5 in order to keep all the premium. What if the price goes over $10?

We’ll review your spread 60-90 minutes before closing on your spread’s expiration date. At that point, a few different things can happen:
If both legs are in the money, we’ll assign and exercise them.
If both legs are out of the money and are not at risk of being in the money, we’ll let your positions expire.
If one leg is at risk or in the money, we'll close the spread.
Keep in mind that the Risk Check occurs about an hour before market close on the date of expiration. Risk Checks cannot be opted out of.

After the big move down, the rest can feel like a drawn out whimper. It's also never in a straight line.

From a trading perspective all of this mania in options creates situations where premiums are high and using options to express any view can involve increased risk. Below are a couple examples of strategies where costs might be reduced (and therefore overall risk might be lessened) with multi leg strategies (vs the really high premium of single leg calls and puts). It focuses on bullish for inevitable bounces, bearish for those that want to position for when the squeeze ends, and neutral for those that want to sell into the insane vol. This is all for informational purposes. Things are wild in these names and sometimes the best strategy is just kicking back and watching. But what I'll discuss here is how to use multi-leg with very defined risk, to reduce cost, and not get crushed by implied vol or massive moves.

&#x200B;

**Using a directional Butterfly to lessen cost**

An Iron Butterfly lessens the premium at risk versus an outright option buy and even vertical spreads. It is typically thought of as a neutral trade but its center can be used as a rough price target in the stock, providing a wide range of profitability for a very low premium outlay

As an example, let’s look at a butterfly to the downside, in GameStop. This involves selling a call spread (+160c/-80c), and selling a put spread (-80p/+9p) with overlapping strikes at 80, creating a target near 80 in the stock. What makes this trade fairly inexpensive compared to other bearish strategies is it’s selling 2 options at an extremely high volatility, via Options Ai

Butterfly [Chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-28-at-11.50.56-AM.png)

This Butterfly example is profitable anywhere between $143 and $17 in the stock with a max gain at $80. Its profits trail off the farther it is from $80 but it makes some money anywhere between those two breakevens (at expiration)

Its max loss is anywhere above $160 or below $9 in the stock. The strikes and where to center the butterfly is just an example above, the center should be thought of as a price target and is completely up to the trader where to target. Often in wild stocks these type of strategies can be found for very little premium outlay compared to the wide range in the stock where profitability in the trade is possible. And as I mentioned in a previous post, it can even be done a simple 1x2, if the strikes are equidistant from zero, using zero as the free lower wing of the fly (e.g. 100p/50p 1x2, 50p/25p 1x2 etc)

&#x200B;

**Using call spreads directionally to lessen cost**

And for those that are bullish after large selloffs, again, spreads might be better utilized than simply buying an outright call. Here’s a Debit Call Spread, that takes advantage of the high price of out of the money calls to greatly lessen the required breakeven level in the stock:

Call Spread [Chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-28-at-11.52.44-AM.png)

Upside calls in these stocks are quite expensive and this type of trade takes advantage of that by selling those far out of the money calls to greatly reduce the cost of the near the money call being bought.

&#x200B;

**Selling to both the bulls and the bears, with defined risk**

Then of course there is a completely neutral view. Here’s an example of using the expected move to create an Iron Condor, establishing a range of max gain if the stock remains between its short strikes:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zz0wuttbq6e61.gif

Implied volatility in these stocks is off the charts. And it’s been rising as the stocks go higher, and will likely compress as the stocks go lower. Therefore, traders need to be very aware of the premium risk they are taking on both the long and short side of options.

Per spotgamma:



Not to defend 

@robinhood

but its likely the decision to remove $GME wasn't theirs. Here is a rough theory: Best guess $delta for MM's was $5bn = 15mm shares w/stock @ $350. GME float ~46mm much of which locked up by HODL'ers. Simply not enough stock.

50% of the gamma in the name was tied to 320 strike and 1/29 expiration. With 50-65k contracts in the money set to expire on 1/29, the potential share delivery may have mean ""failure to deliver"" as there aren't enough shares to settle. That creates a whole mess. 

To stop the squeeze and prevent larger systemic problem, the SEC tells brokers no more trading in $GME. $AMC and the stocks flop.

It was a indirect way of giving the Hedge Funds a bailout by changing the rules of trading in order to force the price down. It all started when Robinhood decided to cease the trading of GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more. These are the popular ""meme"" stocks on the sub reddit (WSB). After Robinhood did this act that none of us saw coming, other Brokers followed suit. Even Webull was ""forced"" to do the same.

The CEO of Webull said, ""It wasn't our choice... this has to do with settlement mechanics in the market."" The irony of it all is that Robinhood, an broker name after a vigilantly that stole from the rich to give to the poor, did the exact opposite. In fact, Robinhood stole from the poor retail traders and gave to their billionaire hedge fund friends.

I personally will not be using Robinhood anytime soon. I advise everyone to boycott them for manipulating the markets. Maybe a class action is soon to follow?

**$SLV -** Is a trust that reflects the performance of the price of silver. $SLV is starting to trend on the popular subreddit, WSB. Just because of this I am looking for a pop in the coming trading days. I'll keep following the trends online and keep everyone updated on Twitter. Since the GME boom, it is hard to overlook such trends. I will set a low target price of $26 and want to enter it the super trend turns bullish at around $25 OR if $SLV pulls back to the support of around $23. Keep it small here; overall risk is minimum in my opinion.

For example, Sell Apr 16 250 Call/ Buy APR 16 270 Call. Got a quote for this yesterday at 9.79 premium. and max loss of 2000 - premium.

The likelihood that the stock will be lower than 250 in April seems really high to me, are there any risks to this position that I'm not seeing?

1. You know the halt is going to happen, so you load up on GME OTM Jan 29 puts.
2. You are your hedgie buddies see the order book and limits, and sell back and forth all the way down to sub $200, increasing your put options values. You may have bought shares at $300, but it doesn't take too much volume and option gain will more than offset it. 
3. You know Robinhood and others will lift the trading ban tomorrow. It is in your control. 
4. Close out puts before market close (Today) for big gain
5. Load up and buy GME OTM calls. Jan 29 or Feb 5 expiration, not sure?  Someone has to sell these calls to you though. 
6. After hours trading with hedgie buddies, not hard to have ""artificial gains"" that entice retailers tomorrow morning. You can use this time to start buying back some shares to drive price even more (to cover your short). This is where you are taking a loss on your original position. 
7. Market opens, retailers come back in full force and start buying up shares, thinking they're still hurting the big bad suits, but you are laughing along with them 
8. You can momentum trade even more with more short positions you need to close (buying back stock)
9. GME spikes to $1000 or more

Well we have a very big bull run last year so most people make more than a few hundred percent. But well I am happy with what I achieve and I set a target to achieve it again this year.

&#x200B;

Just in case you are wondering I am not selling you anything. There is nothing to buy here

&#x200B;

The strategy I employ is the Options Wheel Strategy (this is nothing new, selling cash secured put, selling covered call and collecting dividend)

&#x200B;

1) Selling Cash Secured Put (collect premium)

2) if assign stock, sell covered call against it and let stock get call away

3) If you are holding stock you may get some dividend from some stock but also bearing in mind most of us has a margin account so we need to pay interest to hold the stock when we borrow 50% typical setting for most brokerage so don't count on dividend as a income

&#x200B;

Benefit of this

Targeting 1% a week, 4% a month or 52% a year (this is the objective) We can make more when we have a good run in stock more on that later

&#x200B;

Best Market Condition

This is a bullish strategy, it benefit from sideway to up market. Minor down market is easily overcome (correction of 10 - 15%)

If it is a bear market like what we have in 2020 feb to april the strategy will lose money and need a long time to recoup back

&#x200B;

Stock not suitable (stable, low IV stock)

EEM, EBAY, KO this will all not work well following the 1% rule (I will discuss it later)

&#x200B;

Stock that is good right now (High IV and stock is potential for a good run up)

Nio, Fubo, AMD, NNDM, SURF (many more)

If you do not think the stock will go up or if you think the stock will go down then do not start the process at all

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1% Rule we wil be using NIO as a example

Start by selling a cash secured put and aim to collect 1% premium (we can be a bit greedy at times)

&#x200B;

Year 2021

On the 28th December I sell a 41 Put (expiry date 8th Jan) for $1.66 when Nio was about $45 range, to collect 1% we should be aiming for a $0.40 premium but as NIO is coming down and I am a bit greedy and decide to take on more risk so I collected 1.66 which is 4%. The Put Expire

On the 12th Jan I sell a 58 Put (expiry date 15th Jan)for $1.33 again if it is 1% rule I should be looking to collect $0.60 based on NIO price at that time is around $60. Greediness overtake me. NIO drop below 58 and now I am long 100 share of NIO at 58

On the 19th Jan I sell a 63 Call (expiry date 19th Jan) for 0.58 (stick to my 1% premium) the reason is if I were to get higher premium I have t o sell the call at a lower strike than I will have less upside gain. I want to score big on the upside gain. That way If I am being call out on NIO I will be able to make many more of the 1%. The call expire as NIO is below 63

On the 25th Jan I sell a 68 Call (expiry date 29th Jan) for 0.88 (slightly more than 1%. I keep my upside gain intact if i am being call out at 68. I would have gain $10 on my stock position + all the previous put call premium that I collected. The trade is still on going but look like the call will expire. And Next week I will repeat the process

&#x200B;

I did this type of trade a lot and I certainty believe NIO is bullish for this year, If my belief has change over the course of trading than I will just liquidate the stock and do it on another stock. 

&#x200B;

On a $60 stock for NIO I am currently up $400 for less than a month (that is 8% return on my capital, if I were to count using margin my return would be over 15%)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Advise 

Going for 1% premium is usually safe, when you sell a put for 1% premium on a high IV stock (NOT EBAY NOT EEM) the delta is low and most of the time the put will expire worthless, and when you get assign the stock you turn around and look for a 1% premium on the call side (that give you plenty of upside potential, you might be holding on the stock for week or month but when the run come and your stock get call away you will make more than your 1%. In anycase if you keep doing this you get to collect your 1% every week.

&#x200B;

Let think about it, if the market is up and you get assign the share you score big, if the market is up and you dont get assign for 52 week you get to collect 52% premium, and if the market tank for the year for 20% and you keep doing what I have been telling you you still get to collect 32% extra even if your stock tank 20%",options

&#x200B;

We all knew that today would be rough for several reasons in GME and others stonks. Those reason have been stated repeatedly or speculated on/in many places and are not ""uncomplicated."" So I'm ignoring them and isolating this day in a box of two things.

&#x200B;

1. What happened this morning was due to MUST Holdings dumping on us. ie multiple halts. If you had buy order in at $50-160 range, you know, just because ""hey you never know,"" it probably got filled. They were the ninth largest holders of $GME. This sucks, and I hate them for it, but they all so bought all those shares at $4 bucks or whatever. Still screw them and their play.
2. The second thing that happened was a large collusion by trading platforms to force a panic sell to cover shorts while the big dump occurred. Who knows what will happen with that. I'm guessing a fine, since several platforms followed suit, or some prison time at a federal club med \*cough\* I mean prison. Regardless these two things happening simultaneously caused mass chaos with people who didn't have much in the game and didn't want to lose it, and where only given one option, to sell. Super messed up. The stocks that WBS were excited about took a hit with GME because of classic and illegal fear tactics implemented in a new way imo. I lost few thousand in profits that I'm very unhappy about. 

&#x200B;

Did Melivn, Citidel, Point72 and MUST Holding's in Korea all collude with APEX to make this happen? Seems fishy considering how instrumental Korea was to the rise of bitcoin and how shorted GME was. Almost like ""here's a back up plan."" Who knows but I hope they all burn for it if its true. I'm sure there are tons of other opinions but this is what started it. If you sold well... I still think about my losses from 10 years ago and how I could have played it differently with 💎👋🏼. Those of you OG traders from the 2008-09 crash, V-wagon, 2017 hype of crypto and other massive plays know that these things happen. 💎👋🏼 If you ride them out, you bank big time (usually). Anyway, I hope you bought the dip and trying to figure out what part of the moon you want to build your $10 milly mansions on. Mine is going to be by the 🇺🇸 if it's there 😳. Luckly for me all my plays are long and I bought contracts pre-rise and todays dip. I'm curious how this will all play out. Exciting day and hopeful a lucrative one tomorrow.

243,Trying to understand GME and Options for a project,,3,l7m5p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l7m5p2/trying_to_understand_gme_and_options_for_a_project/,1611904118.0,"Hi,

I know, another GME thread. However, I have gotten a decent grasp of the situation at hand, but wanted a tuning fork (hopefully you guys) to make sure I understood things correctly.

1. Quick confirmation of my understanding of options/gamma squeeze. An option call is is a contract for a set of 100 shares by a certain expiry date in which you expect a higher strike price than the current market price. You have the right to exercise this at any time before expiration, and ITM refers to having met the target strike price or the current market price is above it. You make a profit from exercising an ITM option call as you pay strike price x 100 and sell these shares at the current market price? Once exercised, the broker is then responsible for delivering the shares to you, but if they don't have this on hand, they must buy available shares in mass regardless of the current market price, which triggers the gamma squeeze? OTM option calls are simply expired? Are Option puts the same as short selling?
2. I see conflicting information around today's buzz. I was under the impression it is due to the vast quantities of ITM option calls that can be exercised today, triggering a gamma squeeze, which may just be the final push we need for the short squeeze. However, I see people talking about Melvin and co needing to cover their shorts by today. I thought that shorts do not have an expiration date, only that the broker has the right to margin call at any time to collect their loaned shares. Any clarifications?
3. I only have a rough idea regarding the short ladder attacks/reloading shorts/doubling down on shorts in which Melvin and co. have used the last few days to drive the prices down during low volumes, any good explanations of how this works? Additionally, I don't quite understand the relationship between the short interest and their continued short ladder attacks. We seemed to have gone from \~140% to 120% shorted interest, despite the doubling down on shorts. Wouldn't the short interest increase as a result? I heard that institutions are only required to report long term shorts and not short term, is this perhaps why?
4. How do we know whether the 120-140% short interest is shorts from a while back that we expect them to take major losses from, vs shorts made more recently? It seems to that the numbers have changed, and they have continued to short, how do we know the ""make up"" of their short interest? They can cover shorts from $300 of this week than the ones they did at say $10 a year ago, what if the majority of the current short interests are these newer shorts?

I'm quite fascinated with the whole thing, and I may have to present my understandings for a project, so I'd deeply appreciate any guidance to fill in the gaps. Thank you in advanced!

Think about what would happens in the next few days if more retiail investors had gotten into GME shares and options. The shorts would have lost a hella more!

And now what? We are filing complaints, law suits are happening, great. But I want to say we can not back down on this one. Don't let them get away with just some warnings and fines. **We need to stand strong on this one and do whatever we can to have justice served to the fullest.

# we need to stand up and have the SEC investigate on what and who is behind all this, not just the brokers.

If I was whoever behind this whole chaos, I just realized something. I am a big fish, with my power, if I make the wrong move, I can just change the play to mitigate my mistakes. Perhaps I was going to lose **10 billion** and now what I will get is maybe **100 million** in fines and some warnings, haha, move on to the next play.

As a Canadian, I can still buy GME today. I just picked up another 10 shares and I am not selling. I don't care if I lose that money. What we are seeing is much more significant than a historical short squeeze, it is the whole way the market works!

The whole problem seemed to start when they offered the 60s last Friday when the stock was 35, then had to scramble to buy shares to delta hedge when the stock mooned. Right? Instead of learning from it, this week they kept offering higher and higher strikes and running into the same issue. Why?

&#x200B;

Let me remind you: Robinhood gets paid by large funds that want to get an information advantage and by lending out shares of retail investors. Some articles suggest that Citadel is one of Robinhood's largest PAYING clients and other articles suggest that Citadel has made a large investment in Melvin Capital. I am not saying there is a plot to bring down retail traders, but I am saying that all traders should ask serious questions about incentive structures at work here!

Robinhood therefore has a large risk if not enough shares are available. Tomorrow is an important option expiration date. Millions of shares linked to call options should change hands but I am not sure how this would work. Potentially, there aren't enough shares to allow for this and that will create a large problem not only for hedge funds that shorted those shares, but equally for the brokers that lend them those shares. Since many Robinhood retail investors hold shares in GME, I believe this is where the risk of not having enough shares is highest! 

In the last days, I argued to be very careful about the dynamics at play here. Unfortunately, my posts did not get too much attention. Again, let me highlight to all traders on all sides of this trade, but especially to retail traders:  be very careful today and tomorrow!!   


I believe that we will likely see technical problems, connectivity issues or adverse management decisions on the brokerage sides. 

What should you do: Make sure you have a strong internet connection. Make sure your portfolio is structured in a way that you can sit out any short term volatility or accessibility issues. Have additional capital unemployed and ready as backup. Do not go to extremes in terms of margin! Plus if you have several brokerage accounts in case there is an issue at one broker! 

Update today: Robinhood (""democratizing finance"" while getting paid by hedge funds) has made it impossible for retail investors to buy shares in GME and other hype stocks. While this seems not necessarily illegal, it still is remarkable and expected. Retail investors that did not pay commissions, have to pay somehow for Robinhood and currently they see what this might mean.

Investors at Interactive Brokers and other brokers get a percentage of the fee the broker gets from lending out shares. We see however, that all brokers have now increased the margin required to buy GME to 100%. This seems a fair move to me as all brokers have to manage risk. Robinhood's move to not allow further purchases of GME even if investors have plenty of funds and would only invest a small portion into GME cannot be understood from a perspective of protecting individuals, the market or the broker, only in the context of previous action at Robinhood.",options

Here are the put options I bought:
$2 P for 0.60 Jan 2023
$20 P for 7.97 Jan 2022 
$50 P for 28.00 Jan 2022 

I now understand that these were not good investments due to high IV at entry, and that even though I think the stock price will plummet in the next year due to fundamentals and other reasons, the sell price of the put may also go down as IV decreases. I also recognize that for two of these options, the breakevens are below my target price, but at the time I was thinking that this didn't matter because I wasn't planning on exercising.

I never thought in a million years I’d be in a position to outright turn down $100k+ but here we are. It’s a big financial decision and while no one is a financial advisor, I could use some thoughts from some vets.

I have 3 contracts expiring tomorrow for GME 115c. My Robinhood data was glitched so I don’t know the true price of the 3 contracts at the peek at around $470 today (it showed the 3 contracts were worth 500k and that I was up 1.6million which I know isn’t right although I wouldn’t mind). I think the 3 contracts woulda been a bit north of 100k (470-115)x 100 x 3 = 106,500 and extrinsic value

Anyways I was wondering the option of exercising 1 if not 2 of them. I paid a hair less than $6k for the 3 contracts so it’d essentially buying 100 shares at $135. I do feel like the squeeze is yet to come end that a share could be $1000 if not more.

I won’t have the buying power to exercise the 2 shares unless I sell the other 1. I’m on the west coast so the options expire at noon Pst.

Before You Initiate the Transfer

Be sure to resolve any account restrictions or negative balances in your account prior to requesting a transfer, or your transfer may be delayed.

How to Initiate a Transfer

To begin the process, you'll need to contact your other brokerage and have them initiate the transfer. They’ll submit the transfer instructions to our clearing partner to transfer over your assets and funds.

NOTE
If you transfer all of your assets to another brokerage, we’ll close your account.

Please make sure you initiate an ACATS (Automated Customer Account Transfer Service) transfer. Please don’t request stock delivery using any method other than ACATS, including DTC and transfer agent transfers.

You might need to give the other brokerage your Robinhood Securities (RHS) account number. You can find this information in your mobile app:

Tap the Account icon in the bottom right corner.
Tap Investing.
Your account number will be at the top of your screen.
You may need to reference a DTC number for your transfer. Robinhood’s DTC number is 6769.

What happens after I initiate a full transfer?

After you initiate a full transfer, your account will be restricted to ensure the transfer is processed smoothly. You won't be able to make any trades on the assets being requested, including options in the underlying asset, while the transfer is in process, but keep in mind that you'll still own the securities or positions during this time, and they'll update in the app to reflect their current market value.

You may receive some assets during subsequent, residual sweep distributions. A residual sweep is the process of transferring any securities that may have remained in an account after completion of the initial ACAT transfer. Residual sweeps are common when you have unsettled trades or dividend payments at the time the ACAT transfer request is received. This process usually occurs on a weekly basis after the initial transfer is completed. You do not need to take any action to initiate these residual sweeps.

Please note that Cash Management and Robinhood Gold will be downgraded as a part of the full ACAT transfer process. If you decide to use Robinhood again, you won't be able to opt back into Cash Management at this time. You will, however, be able to resubscribe to Robinhood Gold.

What happens after I initiate a partial transfer?

After you initiate a partial transfer, your account assets being transferred will be restricted to ensure the transfer is processed smoothly. You won't be able to make any trades on the assets being requested, including options in the underlying asset, while the transfer is in process, but keep in mind that you'll still own the securities or positions during this time, and they'll update in the app to reflect their current market value. Once the partial transfer is complete, any remaining position will be unrestricted and you'll be able to resume trading of that asset.

What happens to my assets when I request a transfer?
Stocks and ETFs

Any full, settled shares should be transferred to the other brokerage. If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep.

Options

Any options contracts you have should be transferred to the other brokerage.",options

That means I pay 15,560$ for the contract.
I can then exercise it and pay 6k to get the shares. 

The current gme price is 311.xx (let's assume for this example the price doesn't change between exercising and selling)

Now I've spent 15,560+6,000=21,560.
If I sell those 100 shares at 311.xx I make 31,100$. 

That is basically free money.
But that's too good to be true. So can someone poke some holes in my theory?",options

Edit: keep it up guys you are getting heard


It’s been a tough day, and we’re grateful to you for being a Robinhood customer. In light of the extraordinary market conditions this week, we temporarily limited buying for certain securities this morning. Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. 

This was a temporary decision made to best continue serving you, and was not an easy one to make. We know it’s led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity.

As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.

To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.

The past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone—not just institutional investors and hedge funds. We’ve seen a new generation enter the market, and they’re sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. We stand in support of you, our customers. Democratizing finance for all means giving more people access, not less.

We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and will update this Help Center article with the latest changes. We also published a blog post regarding today’s events.

Thank you again for being a Robinhood customer. We’re so grateful for your support.

Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team

I'm new here but I am sort of freaking out. I have three calls for GME that should all be ITM tomorrow at open, but they do not expire tomorrow. All expire next week.

What will happen to my options if the short squeeze occurs? I am wondering if I should try to sell tomorrow if it hits an ATH or if I should just wait to see what happens if there is a squeeze.

I’m curious if these brokerages have banned this too and if there is some loophole they could use to essentially deny you the right to exercise given the current situation .

funds started shorting GME years ago when the underlying was 10, 20, 30, etc.  It is these people who will potentially get squeezed.  some of these may have already covered.  But funds are continuing to short.  the difference is that the underlying with the new shorts is 300, 400, 450, etc.  these shorts will not get squeezed unless we start to moon or even mars.

the problem is the short interest data we are all going by is a) not updated frequently and b) does not indicate the underlying when short occurred.  

so yes, short interest could still be at 138%... but it could have been done at recent levels, making the exit timing very difficult or impossible if trying to time is right.

I had contracts on Robinhood that spiked to 13k at 1am on Jan 22 briefly. I don't know how I managed to do this but I didn't notice it at all. I didn't see it in my timeline until today. I know I clicked on the option and looked at the chart, but somehow I never noticed this spike from the 22nd. I ended up selling the options for 900 dollars to pay bills thinking they'd reach their potential (it was more or less my first time seeing them with gains) but I waited a few days before I sold having no idea about the after-market spike from the 22nd. Then the boost from GME, boosted the value the stock as.well. If I'd known about that spike on the 22nd. There's no way in hell I would have sold. My question is, what can I do about this in the future? I can't let this happen again no matter what. Devastating losses, I'd rather it'd had expired worthless than to past the chance of that up (for me, it's a lot of money). I think bills weren't the only part of the reason I sold, the other reason was I had two contracts expire worthless in the previous month so I think I was on edge about the last few contracts I had. 

Is there a program I can use that would alert me when this huge shifts happen? I feel like the fact that this occurred should been stressed to me a lot more. I don't remember seeing any alerts or notifications of the huge shift like I'd seen with other stocks. I didn't even consider that I'd be able to make such a silly mistake, I'm usually pretty good about stuff like that. If I have to change brokerage and pay that is okay. Maybe it's better that I pay trading fees anyway. It may force me to consider selling more carefully. I can't do this again, losses are fine and normal but not like this.

Just dropping in a quick strategic analysis on Nokia given the number of questions I'm receiving on it. The details of the discussion are applicable for the week ahead and can be found below:

**Expected move:** \+/- $3.20 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $9.70

**Lower Expected move:** $4.30

**Potential move:** \+/- $5.30 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $11.80

**Lower Expected move:** $4.25

**Historical Volatility:** 49.9%

**Implied Volatility:** 362.1%

**Daily implied move:** \+/- 22.63%

**Put-To-Call Interest:** 0.23

**10-year high:** $11.75 (Feb 7, 2011)

**5-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**1-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**Bullish Trade idea:**

* Long Equity @ $6.50
* Sell $10 strike Covered Calls for Feb 5, 2021 expiration for $2.00
* Cost basis on stock: $4.50
* As long as IV remains elevated, continue selling OTM covered calls to gradually reduce cost basis
* Downside risk is to $3.30 area, which is strong support
* If the stock is called away at $10, a realized return of $10 minus $4.50 = $5.50 is generated
* Upside of $5.50 / $4.50 = 122% in just over a week

**Trade Modifications/Adjustments:**

* Purchase 1/2 desired position above
* Sell 1/2 desired position in cash secured puts at the $5 strike for Feb 5, 2021 for $0.95
* Cost basis on stock declines to $3.55, which is near support from lows seen in Nov 2020

**Other considerations:**

* Short float is low at 0.94%, which negates the potential for a short squeeze - organic buying is required to push the stock higher
* Next earnings report should occur in the next 2 weeks
* Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment
* Nokia will be a big player in 5G rollouts globally as well as IoT

:edit to include naming CITADEL in the complaint
=======

I would like to submit a complaint and a request for investigation to the senator.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them as they are on the losing side of the trade.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and it has never been a problem when retail traders are losing money to hedge funds during business as normal, but when retail traders are finally on the winning side of a trade and Wall St is finally on the losing side of a trade they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us.

I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors, namely the market maker CITADEL, who also provided a $2 billion loan to Melvin Capital, a hedge fund who was on the losing side of the trade and held short positions on these stocks, to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is a clear conflict of interest and this is market manipulation.

I am also requesting the senator to use their regulatory authority to examine why it is that Wall St fund Melvin Capital can enter trades such that one wrong trade going against them can bankrupt their entire billion dollar hedge fund, and require bail out from the other Wall St Market Maker CITADEL, who is a market maker that is supposed to transact the trades. It is a colossal failure of risk management practices at Melvin Capital, and creates massive conflict of interest for CITADEL. I am reminded of the time in 2008 when Wall St took reckless risks and as a result, when everything came crashing down, the government had to step in and bail them out, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill, and Wall St executives paying themselves multimillion dollar bonuses. There has no accountability and as an American citizen, this is not acceptable.",options

My calculations might not be exact but it should represent the spirit of what is happening. 4 contracts were executed at the same time with different prices. These are likely long puts in the April expiration and short put in February cycle. Since the long trades will cover the short positions, the trader will only need to pay the difference in the prices which is around $3.2 million for 1,231 2/19 40puts, and 1,231 2/19 140 puts. Again, this trade is defined risk and the dealer can not lose any more than what he paid for. (This is only one of a few possible trades and in my opinion the most reasonable). 

[Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/x95upw8xc9e61.png?width=3348&format=png&auto=webp&s=80e00329a93fec9575e789e619e540bba7b2eaa1)

The blue line represents the payoff by 2/19 expiration of the short positions. I have set hypothetical stock prices at various levels and only when stock price is over $1,966 a share, does the position start to lose money. As it currently stands the position is profiting around $300k. The payoff by 2/19 expiration will be highest if stock price is around $140, at roughly $9 million (50% chance to be profit between $9 million to $300k). 85% chance to not lose money and only 10% chance to lose more than $1 million. However, even if the trade was unprofitable by the time 2/19 rolls around, 

[April Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/imnsnfwye9e61.png?width=3336&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c8235f97b6839c39915ebd09fd81b50ef37f3b)

There is currently a 62% chance that by 4/16 the stonk price will be lower than the $37 breakeven price for 2/19. And the strategy will profit over $10 million, with around 50% chance of profiting over $15 million. Have you thought of why there are still options available to be purchased? You are consuming the drug and encouraging your fellow fiends to buy more while saying the dealers should be condemned for selling them to you. Guess what, the drugs that you are consuming can be produced by a push of a button and you are playing a game without knowing the odds of winning. 

The moral of the story:

1. Apes will always lose even when you feel like you are winning
2. Short positions on options do not mean overall short positions, apes need to look beyond the immediate future
3. It would not hurt to learn about probabilities and math since that is what you are doing
4. There is roughly a 5% chance that the dealer will be busted with the punishment being a slap on the hand, but 10x the chance to make millions. 
5. Those whom you idolize might be human
6. What you see could be only half of the picture
7. What if DFV has another account with opposite positions?

Price target is $10 post earnings next week.",,27,l6sl56,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l6sl56/here_is_why_i_bought_400_contracts_of_coty_calls/,1611825805.0,"A bit of background first so you can understand the reasoning why I am pretty much all in on calls. Can post pic of my account below for proof. Please do your own due diligence. I have read all of the coty annual reports for the past few years, transcripts, interviews, 8k filings, i even walked to their headquarters in Amsterdam to see if it was open during the pandemic. So, when i make a bet I do a lot of research. 

I used to work at a hedge fund and one of the reasons why I quit was because I realized I was helping rich get richer. I then moved to Asia and lived there for over 8 years. I learned a lot over there and one thing I saw was how asians love brands and can be addicted to them regardless of quality, although that has changed a bit. Makeup and skincare is popular everywhere and Asians are increasing their usage of perfume too, they did not as much 10 to 15 years ago. 

Coty is the number 1 company in the world when it comes to selling perfume or fragrances. They own their own brands but also own licenses to a lot of other brands.

Covergirl
Kylie cosmetics and Kylieskin
KKW (Kim kardashian)
Burberry (license)
Gucci (license)
Adidas (license) 

Wella (40%) which includes OPI and a lot of stuff many women use at beauty salon and buy at Sally beauty supply, Walgreens etc. 

Over 60 brands which i actually think is too many which is exactly what the new ceo is going to fix. Less brands but more revenues per brand. 

There is a new ceo who was a major boss for L’Oreal for 20 years and then started her own skincare brand and after 3 years basically was acquihired to join Coty. This is the best decision ever made as the stock went from $30 to $3 on shitty management that did a lot of financial engineering and big deals that ended up costing shareholders a lot.

So, here are the catalyst as to why the february numbers are going to be outstanding. 

The company has added new distributors in europe, in fact one of the largest, that they did not have before.

13% of their sales were online or direct, that will be 20% or more this quarter which improves the top and bottom line. 

Added new team for China, which was badly needed. In fact, made a marketing deal with a top Chinese celeb and within a few hours sold out of the product they were promoting. 

New products are being launched in skincare category. 

Shitty brands are going to be sold which raises cash for the business. 

More aggressive expansion of skincare products which is going to be a faster part of the business that WallStreet is not modeling. 

I can show you why below

Revenue breakdown by product as of the last quarter was the following:
55.8% Fragrance
30.% Color cosmetics
0.3%  Hair
13.7% Skin and Beauty

Geography 
42% USA and Latin America
47% EMEA (Europe)
11% Asia Pacific

If you compare to L’Oreal which is $200 billion market cap vs. $5 Billion for Coty. 
40% Skincare
21% Haircare
18% Makeup
11% Fragrances
11% Hygiene products

Geography
42% Asia Pacific
24% North America
18% Western Europe
8% Latin America
6% Eastern Europe
3% Africa, Middle East

If you compare these businesses you can see how these are night and day. 
Asia growth is anemic for Coty at 123 mm last quarter and will be the fastest segment of the business for the next 5 years, I expect it can  grow 30% or more a year and be larger than the Americas segment. Thu is because there was little exposure given the lack of offerings in the Skincare. 

Also, beauty products are consumed more frequently than a fragrance. A perfume can last someone a month or 6 months where as a skincare product can last 1 month or maybe 2. It consists of consistent purchases which brings consistent revenues and cash flow to the business something the business needs to improve upon. 

Company has a lot of debt but have paid of $3 billion and will keep paying jt off given the higher profitability. 2.5 billion was from sale of 60% of Wella and $1 was a direct investment from KKr via a convertible bond at $6.24 conversion price. 

Stock is 65% owned by insiders and there js not a lot of shares out there to buy. So, although no squeeze there is definitely scarcity of shares.

Kylie cosmetics and kylieskin have been growing steadily since their international expansion. Ranking as the 22,500 website in the world.  Both Kylie and Kim will help them grow the cosmetics, fragrance and skincare  via a DTC offering. Those businesses by themselves are like MINI Coty’s as they can sell a lot of stuff under their brand. 

I think the comany will do 20 to 30 cents a share in earnings, wallstreet estimates are 10 to 20 and are all stuck at $6.5 price targets, except Citi which is at $10, she believes turn around is real this time. Stock is still below pre-covid price and can easily go to $10 to $15 on the turnaround taking shape.

Wallstreet is sleeping on this one. I contacted one of the top retail stock analysts, she is on cnbc a lot, and her firm does not cover the stock due to lack of institutional interest. Have LinkedIn messages to prove this but do not want to out her for business reasons. 

This is where the community can come in and buy shares today at $6.90 or options and sell them to the institutions at $15 or higher when they realize what they missed.  

I own the stock and the options. The stock I purchased at $3.33 and still hold and the option I purchased months ago as I felt that WallStreet and main street would catch on to the story but Wells Fargo put out a piece that was quite negative, they are in denial of the turnaround, and has forced consolidation of the stock for months. The reason why I picked the $7 strike js because at the time they were in the money and felt it was a safer bet than say $8 or $10 longer dated calls which started to become too expensive for the risk/reward offered.  

I own 400 contracts cost of .785 per contract with strike of $7 with February 19th as expiration. 

UPDATE 1/29/2020
I have added to my stock position from 12,500 shares to 25,000 shares and added 100 more contracts for a total of 500. 


I feel confident they will do well short-term and long-term when you see the increased growth of online traffic for all their brands online ever since they started selling directly. 

I have so much more info but I can post it in the comments.

But couldn't short sellers simply prevent this by going long on GME in the short term? 

Let's say you are short and the price is at $100 and you know you'd get a margin call if it hits $200, but you don't want to close your position. Couldn't you just buy call options with a strike price of $150? Since it's way OTM it shouldn't be too expensive and if the price hits $200 you just sell your calls and now have enough collateral to not get a margin call until it goes to let's say $400. Now you just buy another OTM call to hedge against that.

So you just stay short in the long term but you go long in the short term. This way you make money while GME goes up and you'll make money when it'll come down again.

The only way to lose money with this play would be if GME stays flat or goes up too slow, which would cause you to lose money on both your shorts and your calls. But with the way GME is currently going that doesn't seem that likely.

Assume that there will be post 4pm moves in GME (and others) and you will be at risk for assignment (or non-assignment) on your short leg. The OCC deadline for option exercises (and contrary instructions) is 5:30pm eastern time, but brokers will have earlier cut offs.

If you cannot unwind your spread before expiration, remember you can always buy back the short leg. This neutralizes any potential risk since you are no longer short. This is especially important if you do not have the equity and willingness to accept assignment.

Remember the OCC in the money thresholds are 0.01, but the owner of an option can submit contrary instructions ('do not exercise') at any time. Exercising an option is the owner's right. If you are short an option, the only way to prevent assignment is to buy back your short (buy to close).

Questions:

* If both legs are in the money. Try to unwind the spread. Give the market maker a little bit so he takes the risk off your hand (so in a maximum $5 point spread, unwind it for $4.90 for example). You give up a little, but you do not want the headache.
* If both legs are out of the money. Consider just buying back the short leg. Pay a penny or 0.05. This is insurance so you do not have something explode against you.
* If one leg is in the money and the other is out of the money. Please make sure you UNWIND this spread because at 4pm your protective leg dies. You have to either exercise the protective leg or use stock to hedge off your risk. However, since you do not know what the holder of your short option position will do, you might get screwed. Please don't do this. It isn't worth it.

340,"Good job guys! More to do. (WSB mods overwhelmed. Post getting auto-rejected there, so posting here)",,0,l7baf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l7baf0/good_job_guys_more_to_do_wsb_mods_overwhelmed/,1611873772.0,"I have very little skin in the GME game... just a few small PUT credit options. But man am I rooting for you guys and enjoying the hell out of this squeeze! For those who don't understand why retail investors are pissed and why this shot across the bow at ""inside"" institutional money to level the playing field is hitting a nerve, I have yet another reason...

It's not just the lack of institutional transparency, with dark markets, bailouts, and the like...

It's not just the crony-ism where the appointees and regulators doling out billions and trillions are from (and go back to) Goldman ...

It's also an awakening from the years of being forcibly held down and held back by the insiders club that keeps the masses last in line to the feeding trough, while they get their fill. It may help to look, in particular, how IPOs work... and its not what many people think.

By the time you and I get to buy (when the stock opens trading on the first day), all the billionaires and underwriters and institutions have had their fill. They get discounted shares and warrants. Then brokerages get their cuts, but those get doled out only to their richest clients. They all profit off of you by selling to you at markup because they had the ""members only"" opportunity to buy before you. To even be eligible for new IPO share allocations (remember, we're still talking pre-market open) you often need a 500K balance at your broker. So one can invest for decades and finally scrape enough together to hit that eligibility threshold... YOU'VE FINALLY MADE IT! YOUR TURN for some IPO shares... RIGHT? You sell some long positions to free up money for your new IPO shares. Not so fast...

Ah, but alas, its a made up number. Its a joke. You wake up to zero shares. The only ones who get shares allocated are the fattest of fat cat clients, because the brokers get to CHOOSE who gets the shares. No regulation there, so that its fair to you and me. They aren't allocated in proportion to interest or even to account balance. The big guys get ALL the shares. All before the first trade takes place. The rest get exactly none. You and I have to then buy them off the ones that got them at a huge discount, most just hours prior to going on the market. Once the stock opens trading, the fat cats who've gotten their fill of shares are making an instant 50%, 100%, 200% off of the retail investors who can only buy when the trading starts.

Tell me how that is OK, but retail investors squeezing the fat cats' shorts isn't?! For anyone complaining or wanting to halt trading, remember that at least this battle between longs and shorts is taking place on the FREE AND OPEN MARKET, not in back rooms, not as favors to clients, not by gaming built-in rules that allow only the richest to get the good gains at the expense of retail. No, none of that. With GME, the long buys and shorts and open options interest and float are visible and tracked and its all in the open market in real-time. The winners did it by taking risk and seeing an opportunity and having steady hands while being on the right side of over-extended shorts by the hedge funds. There is no sweetheart deal BS. And they did it despite trading halting because some insiders lost some money for once and had their buddies halt trading, and are calling for it again.  
 They can't fathom that they took a loss for once, and all because of these ""moron retail"" dogs. Don't even get me started on eligibility requirements to participate in private equity round investment. But there is hope....

""Retail"" has started taking control over the abuses of fiat / monetary policy by centralized (and often corrupt) authorities who control the money supply... We've done it via cryptocurrency, open ledgers, and DAOs. Institutional money ignored us and laughed off blockchain, but has caved and, being scared, is now wanting to hedge their bets by getting in on some of it.

The rise of ICOs and SPACs and direct-to-market IPOs have started to cut out at least some layers of the IPO Ponzi pyramid. Still a way to go here.

Broker fees have been forced to zero by Robinhood and the democratization of market access, options trading, and fractional shares.  Nice work.  But the shit Robinhood pulled today was unadulterated favoritism, selective manipulation that hurt real people and is unacceptable.  More to be done here.

We now need to demand that we have equal access to opportunity like pre-market private equity investment and IPO allocations... our money is just as good as the rich money, and should be treated as such... or else GME squeezes will continue to happen. It can keep going all day every day when retail spots a hedge squeeze to force, if need be. When you're hungry and tired of being held back from the trough while others get their fill, eventually enough is enough. Hey institutions... Either you can reform the IPO process and the other ""we eat first"" schemes, or they will be torn down, targeted by the ""retail morons"" you look down on, circumvented, innovated around, and you'll be left holding the empty bags of fiat, shuttered hedge funds, and a huge tab for your squeezed short sales. GME was the shot across the bow.... and its a shot now heard 'round the world.",options

The following interaction just terrified me:

* An OP posted an argument bullish on GME dependent on data inconsistent with Bloomberg
* I commented with the numbers showing on my screen
* They seemed convinced they had the right data and provided a screenshot as a source
* I DMed them to figure out where the inconsistency was, it was far from the first time I'd seen data services have conflicting numbers but I wanted to figure out where the discrepancy was
* They told me they don't know where the number or screenshot came from but provided a link to a financial blog article with ""a time series chart which agrees"" and claimed ""other"" unspecified sources also agreed
* I asked OP to edit their post to mention that they don't know where the number that their argument depended on comes from and that a reputable source had another figure
* They declined
* That post is still up and underinformed people reading it may make decisions that affect their lives based on it

**To be clear, I don't know that the number they provide is wrong but I do know where the number I provide came from and if the number isn't basically 1 in reality it invalidates the OP's entire argument.**

I want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. 

So be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: 

Shorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. 

Remember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. 

Side-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. 

This right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. 

So just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀 

TLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.",options

TLDR: You can buy any dollar amount of GME you are willing to lose on Robinhood in order to be a part of Economics history and to send a message to Wall Street that they can't mess with the little guys any more

GME might not be about making tendies any more. Now it is about what GME tells Wall Street. Every dollar you put into GME now holds risk, but the eyes of the world are on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and GME right now. Wall Street is learning they can't mess with retail investors and every dollar you buy and hold with shows them that. This is already going to the highest levels of government and is getting the eyes of the world. What happens next is a demonstration that the people who only have stimulus checks to invest are still people who matter and people who have a voice.

If you are willing to lose $5, $10, $100, or $1,000, then right now any amount you put into GME says more than any petition on [Change.org](https://change.org/) ever will. You have to be ready to lose it all, so know that.

$10 x 4.1M degenerates = 140,410.95 more shares that say GameStop matters, business bullied by Wall Street matter (aka Tesla), and that the people matter. This could mean the end of naked short-selling for good and could mean the end of bullying small hard-working businesses out of existence forever. This will change federal policy

its a story about market makers. the funds who sit between you and your counter-party in a stock trade, both in space and time. the funds that make orders so when you want to buy $1000 worth of stupid OTM calls, you can. they used to make money like superman 3/the office: skim little bits off the top.

right now basically all market-makers for retail options are hedge funds. it wasn't always this way. this happened after banks got out of the business during low volatility (which means low spread, where market makers have historically made their money). they declared it unprofitable and said they didn't have the tech for it. maybe that's true. and maybe they were also too regulated to do whatever the hedge funds could do do. time period: 2018-2020.

fast forward to today: the hedge funds now playing at options market-making are doing something that's illegal in other first world countries: paying your brokerage to send them your flow. they provide a service to your brokerage, and they pay your brokerage to do so. as we have all learned from facebook, if you don't pay for the product, you're the product.

as a result they can monitor the market, and front-run: make their own moves before executing your trades. don't get too worked up; your brokerage probably does this too, before they even send the orders in. you are feeder fish.

normally market-makers have to keep their positions neutral to be safe. that means if they sell you a call position, they don't sell it naked -- they have to buy stock to cover. but this takes a ton of money. a retail move of $1k into an options play could force a market-maker to hold $50k, $200k, or more of the underlying stock as they delta-hedge as the price goes up. this clearly requires a ton of capital. wouldn't it be incredible if someone could make markets in a new way that didn't require this?

you can see how, as a regulated bank, you would be at a disadvantage to these ""technological innovations"". if your unregulated competitor didn't have to buy $50k in stock to neutralize the $1000 in options they just sold, they might be able to beat you on price. now they have $200k they can put into options strategies, while you the bank are basically being dragged around by the nose by some retard who used his stimulus check to force you into a quarter-million-dollar position.

you could see how market makers might make an argument that worst case, they could cover using options strategies, at a fraction of the cost of owning stock. they are hedge funds, after all. back to this in a second.

but heres the thing. most brokerages aren't stupid. they'll send mms fraction of their flow, but not their whole flow, because they want the data and they don't want mms seeing everything. they also don't want mms having fulfillment or technical issues and taking down their whole platform. they maintain alternatives. some of them even do their own market-making.

a couple of hedge guys see an opportunity. they agree to create a brokerage and sell flow to their hedge fund market maker buddies exclusively. in return their buddies pay them more for their flow, and they execute their trades slower. fine, whatever, it's a discount brokerage. ""I know, we'll really get these plebs going and name it ""robinhood"", haha, so we can fuck them while we're fucking them.""

they realize if they do this, they can also do something other brokerages can't or won’t: trade fractional shares. if I'm a standard brokerage sending my customer orders to several market-makers, they all would have to support fractional shares or I can't feed those orders through the same process. now the poor people can literally invest their lattes. oh and they're not gonna do the math to see how hard we fucked their fractions. ka-ching.

maybe you're starting to see the problem. or maybe you’re bored and can skip ahead. but anyway: because the only people who can afford to make markets now are hedge funds. so robinhood's market-maker is also a hedge fund. and they took up a short position in a stock. it's what hedge funds do. big fucking position because everyone's doing it and obviously video games don't get bought in person anymore and retail is dead. bc downloads and amazon and covid. too many people sell short but it doesn't matter if it's oversold if video game store goes bankrupt. we all know this. it’s only part of the problem. 

at the same time, your buddies with the brokerage can use that same stock as a ""gift"" for new customers who are super grateful: ""the fuck is this. gamestonk? I got in here to bet cappuccinos on TSLA."" so they sell, spreading the sell data into retail and driving the price down more. shorts ftw. 

meanwhile: some deep fucking retard on reddit sniffs out burry's move against the shorts and gets on board. starts posting boring shit about how he's not making any money. does this every month for like a year. gets made fun of. then starts losing money. gets made fun of more. then cohen buys in. then bankruptcy is off the table. makes a little, gets told to sell. doesn't. then earnings carnage takes everything. gets made fun of. doesn't sell.

then he starts making money. then a lot of fucking money. then more people realize the story checks out. they buy otm calls and shares using retail platforms. orders routed to hedge fund. hedge fund is like haha, these retards, i'll have my lemon party buddy schedule a ""why this is stupid"" webinar and the price will dive. but he's too inept to run a webinar. huh.

enter: the return of volatility. 

and not just normal volatility, but really, really, one-sided volatility. and only on your shorts. suddenly, while market makers make options markets for retail, retail isn't making them for mms. they can't balance the retail calls with other options strategies to save their life. the balance of trade that made their strategy work is gone.

so they're back to standard market-making practices, right? nope. they don't have the capital or the desire to do that. so they get more desperate and creative. start selling more shares short because clearly the price can't keep going up. maybe they get loose with the definition of ""closed our short position"" and now it just means they personally feel like they creatively covered your potential losses. but naked shorts have a funny reality: while your gains are capped, you can lose infinite money.

and what the fuck it keeps happening. they have to do something. other market makers start covering. cue gamma squeezes.

but the price will come down. there's no reason for this price.  ""we won't cover. we'll take up more short positions higher up. it will come down and we'll be fucking black. haha these fucking plebs. sell ladders with our friends. come on friends!!""

but it doesn't work. the losses mount. your friends lending you your leverage start to realize something is up. they check in with you. your paper losses are insane. but to fix the situation you'd have to close out basically everything and that would be a $500B shit on the market. your buddies don't want that, your lender doesn't want that. they also don’t want to hold those shorts. and your big customers are just as badly off. so competitors lend each other money. collusion? fuck it, we're dead if we don't. get rich or die trying.

overheard at schwab (owns tdameritrade): ""wait, are we still market-making? did we loan money to any of these market makers?""

in the robinhood engineering meeting: ""hey guys, people are talking about citadel getting fucked. but they're the only ones who support our integration to sell fractional shares, so even if we had set up alternatives, which we didn't (because startup), we can't trade this stuff anywhere else."" 
“uhhhhh fuck. start closing positions. i don’t care. now.”

maybe no other brokers have this particular issue because worst case they can send it direct to the markets. that might be rough, but not as rough as not being able to close positions with citadel gone. robinhood probably can’t ipo without these guys. maybe ever. 

data point:
robinhood has (allegedly) done something illegal today
when a startup visibly does something they know is illegal, right before a planned ipo, it is not to save their buddies money (because hey they're sociopaths to begin with) but because something much worse is happening. it is because of an existential threat

data point: 
td ameritrade has removed sell limits if the limit is too high. this appears to be so they can lend your shares (to the shorts/market makers), which they could not do with a sell limit set. 

data point:
when you hear about a loan from one competitor to another, and they announce it, that should tell you a couple of things:
one, desperation. both parties. that probably means collusion. a common enemy. a serious threat.
two, other people are afraid. why else announce it at all? their investors and brokers are freaked the fuck out bc they know something more is wrong than buddies coming down.
three, $1.5B is not enough to cover, is it? they must 10x this via leverage and then apply? or maybe it is enough to keep away the margin call.

data point:
large GME sale announced publicly during trading day, while shutting down the buy side. articles saying ""you can make money, but only if you sell""
these guys have been calling everyone they know trying to relieve pressure before tomorrow. apparently no one domestic agreed to do it so they had to go offshore. i wonder if they offered an off-market deal to make this sale happen

data point:
the hedge funds are leveraged at least 10:1 with margin provided by someone
citadel is the largest but there are 10ish of them making markets
whoever is providing this margin would normally just force a margin call. but maybe they can't bc it would force closing of e.g. $500B (10x leverage minimum) in positions per fund they force. that would in turn drive prices down, triggering other margin calls. the ten funds involved in market-making could be $5T market $ assuming they haven't gone beyond 10x leverage.

AMD and CAJ reported this week. So far, the trade is going well and I think there's a lot of juice left in it.

AMD beat but acknowledged some inventory tightness. [Here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) is a transcript of the call.

Canon reported overnight (3pm Tokyo time), [here (PDF)](https://global.canon/en/ir/conference/pdf/conf2020e.pdf) is the slideshow. They beat their sales and profit projections. Operating profit for the ""Industry and Others"" segment, which includes lithography equipment for chips and flat-panel displays, grew by 470% YoY (slide 30). The ADR is trading in-line with last night's (pre-earnings) Tokyo price action, and it hasn't moved much as a result of new information in the earnings release. The local stock (Tokyo 7751) doesn't open until after US market close. I rolled from the Feb 22.5c to the Feb 25c and Mar 30c yesterday, and may add more today.

As I mentioned, AMD's Lisa Su said AMD had been affected by semiconductor shortages on the earnings call during Q&A:

>Certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. We saw a strong revenue ramp in our business, as well as across some of our peers. It's fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning.  
>  
>As a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily I would say in the PC market, the low end of the PC market, and in the gaming markets. That being said, I think we're getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels.  
>  
>And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there's added capacity in the second half. And then as in terms of how we -- how we think about these things, so for our full-year annual guide, we do have good visibility on both the demand side and the supply side.

So now I am long the 05Feb INTC 56 call, the 05Feb AMD 89.5 put, the CAJ Feb 25 call, and the CAJ Mar 30 call. I like being long vol in this environment, and the cross-currency exposure is also positive in the event of a flight to safe-haven yen. I think the market hasn't fully absorbed how big of an impact the semiconductor shortages will have on the relative valuation between IDM and fabless chipmakers, but several companies (chiefly TSMC) discussed capex toward semiconductor fab buildout as part of their earnings presentations, and the shortage is a headline-making problem for multinational automakers, so I believe that the market is indeed starting to recognize the opportunity in semiconductor fab.",options

The day has come. While these days are painful for long term holders, and really take a low blow out of our portfolios, we are presented with a buying opportunity. This was the worst day for the S&P500 since October 28th pull back. Looks like we were right about a correction of 3-5%. Like I said, the good news is we can buy a lot of stock that we were eyeing now at a great discount. The bad news is, the market could keep pulling back. This is a very big earnings week. A lot of times, investors will pull out before the earnings reports come out and buy back later. If we can get through this week without taking much more losses, I'd call it a win.

**$NOK - +28.5%**

**$AMC- +275%**

In case you haven't noticed, I am making these picks before the huge gains.

It was a tough day for my portfolio. My portfolio is down 10%, or $70,000. This is why I said to play carefully with the 3x. While they can go up by 3x, they also go down by that much. Overall, I'm satisfied to keep holding them as I can stomach the temporary loss. I've been in crypto since 2011 so I'd like to think I'm use to these kind of losses (and more).

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$NOK** \- This has been added to my watchlist since I saw it start trending on the internet as of recently. I picked this one just like I did AMC before they exploded. This one still has room to grow, and it will be in the news now. Tread carefully; this is the higher risk level play. I'd put a couple hundred, or thousand on some short term OTM calls. Or, sell covered calls on the way up.

* Target Price: $10
* Entry: <$6
* Risk: 5
* Timeframe: 1-2 weeks

**$CSTA.U** \- Constellation Acquisition Corp is a SPAC that is planning on acquiring a innovative company in one of the segments of the rapidly changing global economy. ""The company is led by **CEO and Chairman Klaus Kleinfeld**, who previously served as CEO of NEOM, Arconic, and Alcoa. He is joined by **CFO Thomas Stapp**, whose previous roles include serving as an Associate Partner at Bain & Company and a Principal at Oliver Wyman."" I see this SPAC doubling when some rumors start emerging of who they will be merging with. Hold some commons.

* Target Price: $20
* Entry: $10
* Risk: 4
* Timeframe: 1-2 months

*No Charting today. TA isn't needed for NOK and CSTA.U*

In a situation like this, rules go out the window. These people are not going to just accept this.

YES my account is new, but that’s simply because I’ve stayed away from Reddit in the past. I was recommended to try reaching out on here by a friend, haha. So I know this may be viewed as a really lame thing to do, and generally I’d feel the same. To be totally honest with you, this is unfortunately one of my last resorts right now. So for starters let me introduce myself. My name is Kayla, I’m 19 years old at the moment and currently renting from a distant friend of mine here in Wisconsin. As also true for many others and I’d assume you, I have really been struggling recently. I did have a low key job awhile back, but as you mentioned for you that was shut down this year. I’ve gotten to this point in my life where it feels like I have nothing left to go for it, almost as if I’m in a ditch without a shovel. Now I’m not saying any of this to make you feel bad for me, it’s simply part of my story. So earlier this year when everything really started to take a turn for the worst, that’s where I struck and interest in investing. Now the funny thing is I’ve never put a single dollar into the stock market, but I’ve still found so many ways to enjoy it. I’ve heard so many horror stories, yet I’ve spent all year studying and learning about it. Of course like many of us it started as somewhat of a get rich quick thing, but now I’ve really come to learn it’s so much more than that. Now what does this have to do with anything? Well I’ve found this love for the stock market and genuinely feel like I’d do great, but it has been so long since I’ve even had some spare change to my name. With a loss of a job, limited education, little help from my parents, and overall some terrible circumstances it has been hard. So you can probably guess what I’m getting at, I could really use some help. Now I know how ridiculous messaging a stranger on Reddit for support seems, but this really is a last resort. I feel so lost and hopeless, but at the same time I feel like I’ve found my path and just need the help getting to where I want to be. I’ve never been one to beg, but what can I do. It just seems like my worth ethic has been beat by unfortunate circumstances. I could really use a blessing right now, and I come with the best intentions when I say that. I just want to get out of this seemingly endless hole. I want to put a decent meal on the table for once, I want to pay my rent on time this coming month, and so much more. I really don’t expect anything and I’m likely wasting my time by even typing this, but I’m the definition of desperate right now. What may seem like nothing to some of you could be life changing for another, and I could really use it. Even simply someone to talk to to or help advise and support me would be great. Again I know this sounds ridiculous, but maybe I’ll just find the right person on here. Something so small to you could be huge for me, so please keep me in your consideration if you’re ever feeling the need to help someone. Also I’m not talking anything crazy, but it all adds up. I appreciate you for reading all of that regardless. Also, you can message me if you’re interested!!",options

398,Is a reverse gamma-squeeze or similar possible on GME?,,1,l70p4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l70p4g/is_a_reverse_gammasqueeze_or_similar_possible_on/,1611849875.0,"Short interest has stayed miraculously high on GME despite its legendary recent price surge. There has also been very high open interest in buying puts. This is no surprise because puts limit your downside, while short selling does not. For a GME bear, puts are clearly the safer bet.

**Summary of what caused the gamma squeeze last Friday 1/22 (skip ahead if you know this):**

The share price jumped up naturally from people buying  shares, right as most of the higher strike call options were about to expire OTM on Friday. This meant that 0dte OTM calls could be bought for almost nothing. Some people recognized the insane social media support developing on Reddit, and made heavy bets on those 0dte OTM calls before the organic price surge.

Well, their bets proved to be correct when the share price rose above a key price level (I forget the exact number), where there was an extremely high concentration of open interest due to all the 0dte buying.

Once  this key level was passed, OTM calls became ITM, delta increased rapidly, and banks were forced to buy up shares rapidly to hedge. The share price rose rapidly as a result.

**How this could be relevant soon:**

So let's say the GME squeeze gets squozed, most people take profits as planned, and the share price returns to Earth from Alpha Centurai. As put strikes are passed on the way down, delta will go further negative, and banks will be forced to sell shorts to hedge these puts, driving share price further down.

If that sharp GME price decline happens on a Friday when 0dte OTM puts are available, the conditions for a reverse gamma-squeeze could very well be present. My gut says that the conditions aren't exactly right for this to happen, but I'm not sure.

A couple of open questions:

*  Are the availability of cheap 0dte OTM options a required condition for a gamma squeeze? And could an already-high concentration of puts at key strike prices be a substitute for that?
* How will the high IV this week affect the likelihood of a reverse gamma-squeeze?",options

As far as I know, the ideal situation is selling the assigned stocks immediately and selling the long option as well. 

However, I don't understand how this prevents major losses, as the stock price can change drastically between the time of assignment and the time when you actually notice you got assigned and decide to do something about (perhaps you had diarrhoea and were stuck for 2 hours on the bathroom). If we look at an extreme case, let's take gamestop. The GME stock can literally drop 100$ over the course of 2 hours and that would mean a loss of 10k simply because you had diarrhoea and couldn't sell the shares immediately.

To report earnings on Feb. 2nd 
Consensus Estimate ~ $7/share
Whisper Number ~10/share 

Amazon will report fiscal Q4 earnings next week. Q4 will include Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas shopping and for the first time ever Prime day. Prime Day was delayed from July to October in 2020. That will add ~10 billion in additional revenue for the quarter. I expect them to do ~125 billion in revenue and produce earnings of about 14/share, doubling the consensus estimate. 

Note* Unlike some of these stocks that are at all time highs going into their reports, Amazon has trended sideways for months providing a technical setup more in line with Netflix leading up to their report. 

Key Points:

- Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit 10.4 billion globally over the two-day period spanning Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, up from $7.16 billion during the 48-hour event in July 2019.

- Independent businesses selling on Amazon surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Amazon said, noting that the figure was up 60% from last year

- Amazon reported a record breaking shopping season that saw more than 1.5 billion toys, electronics and household goods delivered. 

- Amazon added 30 million prime members in 2020 

- AWS will be impressive as Amazon has captured almost 50% of the entire cloud infrastructure market. At the re:Invent conference in December, Andy Jassy said, “When you look back on the history of the cloud, it will turn out that the pandemic accelerated adoption by several years.”",options

On Friday of last week we had a squeeze because there weren't enough shares purchased by the MMs to cover their call contract positions because basically WSB kept buying the contracts (in addition to shares, but to a more major extent the contracts.)  We know this.  This Friday is expected to be the big ""War"" between MMs/shorts and retail WSB.

The thing is there are contracts being sold right now with strikes of 100, 200, 300.  All of which are in the money.  But not everyone who has bought these contracts has 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 so they will HAVE to liquidate their position for the 1/29 contracts come Friday.  All brokers do it differently but the flavor of choice is Robinhood who will auto sell your position you cannot afford at about 3:00pm to 3:05 that Friday.  This.. we also know.

My question is:  What happens when literally hundreds of THOUSANDS of contracts start getting flushed out at bid pricing?  The bid does go down, but how far?  Who will actually buy?  Will the MMs be forced to buy the contract? **Can it go below strike intrinsic value?**

That last question is the most important if so, because if MMs start buying below intrinsic value, they don't need to hold on to as many shares to cover the position, especially if THEY HOLD THE CONTRACT.  So they sell the shares associated... and well you see where I'm going with this.

If you recall there are 100 shares tied up for each 1 option contract meaning of the total 46.89M (Float) shares available for trading they (Short sellers) have to buy 29.76M of them by Friday. 

That’s 63.35% of all available stocks they are forced to buy at closing bell on Friday if we keep it above $200.",options
433,The art of the Covered CALL (a safer way to gamble) :-),,55,l66izy,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l66izy/the_art_of_the_covered_call_a_safer_way_to_gamble/,1611760502.0,"**Episode 1: A safer way to invest in Options; The Covered CALL**

Options can be a great way to make (and lose) a lot of money very quickly but one of the safer ways to work with Options, is to own and hold at least 100 of the Shares you are taking an Option position on and then get paid to do so – you can still lose of course, but provided you ‘like’ and believe in the Stock you own it’s a great way to make extra income whilst holding onto the Stock.

So how does it work?

**Covered CALL (locking in your potential profit)**

First, you identify a quality Stock to purchase, one that you think has upside potential (not a flash in the pan type Stock) and then if you don’t already own it, purchase a minimum of 100 shares in that company (equivalent to 1 Option);

*N.B: As stated in the opening, this Stock wants to be one you like and are happy to purchase at the current price (or already own) but want to earn some extra income as part of the ‘ride’*

Buy at least 100 shares of it or the Stock in multiples of 100 as each represents 1 Option

Next, sell a CALL on the 100 (or more) shares you own but at a higher valuation than its current price, so if you purchased the Stock at $3.00 for example, then a typical CALL might be sold at $3.25/$3.50 or maybe even $3.75 or above.

*Here’s the good bit; You will get paid directly for selling this CALL and the money added to your Brokerage account immediately :-)* *and you still own the Stock!!*

Now, on the date that the Option expires, if it’s value is below the price specified in the CALL, you get to keep the Stock and the money you received when you sold the CALL – how cool is that? :-) However, if on the other hand the stock has rocketed and is now worth (say) $6.00, you will have to forgo the extra profit and sell it to the owner of the Option for the price agreed in the CALL ($3.25/3.50/3.75?) but don’t worry, on the date of expiration your brokerage will automatically transfer the Stock to the new owner if these conditions are met, so you won’t need to do anything and you have earnt good money both in the uptick of the Stock price and the money you received when you sold the CALL.

So what’s the catch?

Remember I said that this needs to be a Stock you like and want to keep? Well now let’s take the other side; imagine the Stock falls in value; maybe a lot :-( your Covered CALL effectively locks you into holding those Shares until expiration (unless of course you buy the CALL back , but this defeats the main point of the Covered CALL, as when you buy it back you will have to repay some, all or more money than you were paid depending on the CALLS value at the time :-) ) . So lets assume you follow the plan and end up still holding a $3 Stock at the expirey of the Option but which is now trading at $2.25 - does this matter? Well, if this Stock is a great company, and you know it’s going places then who cares? Maybe even double down on it (although this is extremely risky unless you have an awful lot of money to play with), but even in this situation, as you like the Stock and are in it for the long term, the temporary devaluation should have been significantly offset by the CALL money you received at the beginning of the transaction and you can sit tight until it returns to $3 ++ and/or sell another Covered CALL to make some more income whilst you wait!! Not only that, as most CALLS can be bought say one month forward, you can keep repeating this trade taking the income each and every month as long as you continue to own the stock!

Next week I’ll try and do an article on selling PUTS and how (if you've got a margin account) you can use this as an ownership strategy in a descending market or, for profit in an ascending market. Finally in episodes 3 and 4 I'll try and cover off the much famed ‘Naked’ buying of CALLS and PUTS and critically how you can potentially use a PUT to offset shares you own from downside losses and of course in episode 5 we'll do 'swing trading' to finish off.

In the meantime, unless you’re really au-fait with Options then the above is probably plenty of information to digest at this stage!! Happy investing and take it easy guys  :-) Mark",options

GME has become much harder to borrow with the rates to borrow going up.  This means you are at more risk then usual for early assignment on deeper in the money short calls.

If you are assigned early you will have to pay hard to borrow fees until the position is covered.

If you see your short call is trading with no extrinsic value,  you may want to cover your position.

&#x200B;

Edit to ADD:

Sorry, haven't been able to respond to all questions.

When I say short call, I don't mean just naked short.  If you have a call vertical, a call butterfly, or any spread with a short call you are at risk of early assignment.

If you have been assigned on a short call from a spread, you can either exercise your long call or close the position as a spread (you would place an order to buy the stock you were assigned and sell out your long call).  If there is no extrinsic value left in your long call, easiest is to exercise.  If there is extrinsic value left do the latter.

Make sure your broker hasn't closed out the position for you before you act.

Edit again:  I added that your risk in early assignment is for short calls.  Didn't put this in at first as you can't be assigned on long calls so I didn't think it was necessary, but for those who didn't realize this, this clarifies.",options

Would all the selling of these shares at market drive price up, or would it even drive price down due to limited buyers at higher prices and the brokers being forced to sell for whatever market price is available?

Short squeezes happen all the time, most are very subtle and quick, they never make the news and are over before you know it. It can be profitable if you know how to hop on one. The recent case is an unusual one, I knew it was out of control when my friends, who don’t trade or know much about the market, start asking about buying this stock.

When the shorts are covering a few things happen:

1. Longs/Algos Exit: Many Algo’s and funds ride the squeeze, this is an active strategy in the street. As shorts cover, the Longs will provide the liquidity for the shorts to exit their position. Retail who are in the move can also take their profits.
2. Institutions Trim: Though the narrative paints institutions/funds as the enemy, they are in fact the biggest holders, and by default/and by luck, are in the short squeeze from the beginning, Once it gets out of hand, they can decides to trim their position. Institutions don’t hit the market sell button to cause panic, rather they distribute into strength. If enough bid is still there, then the price will hold up.
3. The nail in the coffin: Secondary Offering: Though the stock is being traded like roller coaster, it is still a business and the management has obligation to run it. Businesses go public to raise capital to fund their operations, what better way to raise capital than do an offering when the valuation is sky high.

I wound’t be surprised if the company does the largest secondary offering ever, enough to fund is operations for at least a decade.

What has happened is vol is off the charts in the puts.  I own the $50 puts and they didn't move down when the stock rallied $100.  That does not make sense.  Also if you sold the 320 straddle today for FEB 5th you could have collected $320.  Think about that.  ZERO to $640 range for just over 1 week.

but could you sell the straddle naked without worry?  Check with broker.  If stock went back to just $200 the straddle would be $120 and you make $200.  If stock went to $500 you still make $140.

Vol went to 500% I think.  and that billionaire who bought 20,000 of the $115 calls for this Friday do you think he sold them today?  Paid $20 million?  20,000 x $10/option cost.  At $265 it was worth over $500 million.  do you think he is taking his profits?  If you don't then I'll sell you a bridge.

So assuming we have a 50C option with the underlying share currently trading at $55, intrinsic value would be $5 and this goes directly to the options premium. Should the share increase by $1, intrinsic value would again increase by the same to $1 and the option premium would also increase by $1. Few quick ones:

1/ Where does Delta come in with it's value ranging from 0.5-1 given ITM? How does it contribute to the intrinsic value? 2/ Am I correct to understand that a $1 increase in intrinsic value does not equal to $1 increase in the Options Premium/Price? 3/ Given Delta measures the magnitude of increase in Options Price for an increase in the price of the underlying, wouldn't Delta always equal $1 (given intrinsic value increases by $1)?

514,GME brokerage game,,7,l63vt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l63vt5/gme_brokerage_game/,1611751998.0,"Discussion on the brokerage side of the GME battle that unfolds in front of our eyes: 

There are retail traders and institutions that are LONG GME shares and what that means for their brokers. On the other hand, there are institutions SHORT GME shares and SHORT GME calls and their brokers, often called prime brokers. 

Most retail investors and WSBers have their investments likely at Robinhood, which is famously a no-commission brokerage but makes money lending out shares of their clients. 

Interactive Brokers might also have many clients with substantial number of shares of GME. Here, usually shares can be lend to institutions and the fee gained by doing so will be split between IB and the clients holding the shares. 

Then there are other brokerages that do not lend out the shares held by their clients. Depending on the country, this can be forbidden or clients can approach their broker to disallow any onward lending of their shares and thus reduce the shares available to short GME. 

Hence: the current environment is potentially extremely profitable for Robinhood who is at the center of lending GME shares. But: There is also a certain risk associated with this. 

On the other side of the trade, shortsellers, like Melvin, usually use several prime brokers who then provide shares to them to sell. These prime brokers might get these shares from other brokerages and onlend at a certain rate. I am not sure if Melvin has direct access to Robinhood - I actually highly doubt this. There is some speculation about who the prime brokers for Melvin are. I do not know but a little internet search will yield some very large names. If a shortseller in GME can't owner their requirements, the brokerage will be on the hook. 

Hence: the prime brokerages of GME shortsellers will likely have emergency meetings now. Plus: there are likely different brokerages involved in terms of where retail investors hold their portfolios and with whom hedge funds trade. In other words, it is not just one connected party, but might lead to ripple effects in financial markets.

516,$TAK - Takeda Pharma - A Cathie Wood Ark Invest Darling in the $ARKG Fund - Positions & Strat,,30,l5w5t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l5w5t8/tak_takeda_pharma_a_cathie_wood_ark_invest/,1611721075.0,"I will keep this pretty simple but understand that this is a short and long term play with various strikes and expirations over the next year for TAK.

Background: Takeda is a pharma company old as time based in Japan. They completed a pipeline acquisition of Shire in 2019 and the company has been effectively ""dead"" money since then.

The Big Investment: Cathie Woods (The Queen) famous for $TSLA and other growth plays has recently been purchasing $TAK hands over fists the past few weeks. This is now a top 10 holding in their ARKG fund and is most likely the largest holder of the ADRs (Japanese listed). Here is the link to the holdings of the fund. [https://ark-funds.com/arkg](https://ark-funds.com/arkg)

Follow the Flow: Options flow has been heavy before and after the big ARKG purchases. Where Cathie goes, so do others.

Catalysts: Pharma companies in any stage have catalysts and the capital flow in to the company suggests that these catalysts are going to have some positive outcomes. The company has an investor day this Friday (January 29th) during the World Conference on Lung Cancer (which they also have a drug for in the pipe), earnings report on Feb 4, and an FDA approval that is expected to be announced imminently. They should start to reap the benefits of the Shire acquisition in 2021 and expect to see that in the earnings. In addition, they have numerous COVID-19 dealings regarding the vaccine and treatment.

The Trends: Pharma is making a comeback in a big way and will continue to do so under the new political administration in the US. I am going to leave politics out of this, but the previous was not kind to big pharma and it is expected to do very well under the new. Longer the base in the chart, the more explosive the growth potential, that is real. (this is a real stock, not a meme over on WSB so don't go looking up short float, it has none).

I have also provided a short thesis for the attention deficit FinTwit crowd that provides some ancillary detail not provided here. [https://twitter.com/crisroths/status/1353880127390756864?s=21](https://twitter.com/crisroths/status/1353880127390756864?s=21)

TLDR: TAK is becoming a Cathie Wood ARK favorite and in a very short time frame has amassed over 19m shares or $350m in notional value. Following the option flow and the big money trades with catalysts in the near term to boot, I took a sizable position at Feb 19, Jun 21, and Jan Leaps 22.5 to capture value and force myself to stay in the trade as this is a short and long term play. (This strategy goes against my style of wanting to be in and out, but big pharma is on the rise for the long term).

So I'm reposting it here to see if we could get a good discussion going:

I'd like to get the opinion of some people who understand the economics and math of this.

The actors:

1. Retail traders with deep ITM calls that can't afford to exercise.
2. Market makers that are delta neutral
3. Shorts that are hedged with calls.
4. Shorts that are not well hedged that are holding on for dear life.

What is going to happen to this clusterfuck on Thurs/Fri? Could we see something at shallow ITM strikes similar to what happened to oil where futures prices went negative? A massive negative feedback loop where retail sells their ITM calls, picked up by algos who exercise and liquidate? Algo's exercising and holding to force even more of a squeeze?

There's some funky shit thats gonna happen and i'd like to be in the right place for it. I'm leaning towards a huge liquidation where the smart money starts to exit either EOD today or Thursday due to the threat of retail traders flooding the market with deep ITM calls which will get picked up by institutions that will liquidate immediately.

Colonel after today. All you paper hands should be ashamed with yourself, but you still have time to help your fellow brothers against the Big Bad, Melvin Capital.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

**Conjectures**

I'll describe how Melvin Capital will likely try to countermove their weak position. Everything I write is conjecture, and would be a very low investable thesis but let's continue with the white boarding.

The GME 60C is the beginning and the end for you guys. Huge amounts of call buying and delta hedging occured at this strike. 10s of Millions of shares are linked to these derivatives.

Melvin's Capital goal is to not be forced into a short squeeze. You guys want the the infinite short squeeze to be triggered. MM/Citadel Securities provides the price discovery on how expensive each countermove is for the actors in this game.

Melvin Capital is likely not to double down on naked shorts with the new funds because if he loses in that move, Plotnik's career is over and may face criminal charges for abusing his fudiciary duties by doubling down with more naked short selling.

We saw today how someone forced GME share price to drop over 10% and force halts, thereby dropping off vega and killing off any gamma ramping. It happened over and over. So we know that's what they tactically want to do.

Steve Cohen's, famous hedge fund manager, has a favorite play. He would create massive call and put walls around a strike price to kill off vega and prevent gamma, and collect premium. In ELI5, Cohen would put up massive blocks of expensive puts and calls so that participants would have to churn through them before gamma could be ramped. By the time it happened, theta would have made your positions not profitable. And Cohen would collect the premium as actors tried to hammer through those put and call walls. He basically does this to kill volalitity.

Plotkin was Cohen's right hand man.

So expect Plotkin will use the 2.75B to drive GME price below 60, then he will ressurect massive put/call walls around a strike price and wait out the ITM 60C options across the calendar. This will kill vol and dampen gamma to prevent a gamma squeeze that can trigger an infinite short squeeze.

**Retails counter move**

Retails only chance is to have a big whale on your side to blast threw those put/call walls that will kill vol; or it's a race against time to trigger the gamma squeeze before Plotkin drives the price below 60 and erects the massive put/call walls that make all the ITM 60C expire worthless and dampens anymore gamma ramping to force a short squeeze.

Retail must drive GME to 115 and soon

My question is how much does theta matter for deep in the money calls? I'm wondering if I should sell or if future jumps in prices will make it go even higher? My feeling is that we haven't even short squeezed yet and i barely paid anything for this so if there's the potential to skyrocket again I would rather hold this call but of course if theta will kill it then I should probably sell now.

Hi there, 

I unfortuantley ""responsibly"" bought a bull debit spread on GME weeks before the squeeze here, for 2/5 $50/$51. I buy spreads to limit my risk and sometimes sell one end a few days to weeks before the other on spikes and drops. 

The p/l on this thing fluctuates like crazy, from +15k at one point to sometimes down $300. I've tried to exit for a small profit, for breakeven, but cannot be filled I think due to the prices fluctuations of the calls being so drastically different. I am thinking there is an opportunity here to make a lot off of this, by buying back my sold call and holding my other call for a few mins during a spike. I do daytrade every day, so I do believe I could have a decent probability of finding the right ""time"" but I could also potentially lose a ton due to the current pricing of GME options. 

&#x200B;

Any suggestions? I could just wait it out until 0DTE as well I suppose, and try it then without as much risk. Or just let it expire worthless, I didn't pay much for the spread. (.23c debit)

Thank you.",options

Net income for the quarter was $8.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $8.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share for Q4 2019. Full year 2020 net income was $27.2 million or $0.83 per diluted share compared to $4 million or $0.13 per diluted share in 2019.

Growth Engines: 

\-Microsoft Teams, which is the fastest growing business for $AUDC.

\-Microsoft Teams /UCaas and Contact Center segments will drive growth going forward. Annual Rev for Microsoft Teams grew 300% YoY and more than 30% compared to 3Q '20. 

 \-Contact Center management Rev grew over higher then originally planned 15%. 

\-Enterprise business, UCaaS, and Contact Center grew 17% in 2020 and provides 78% of overall revenue. Revenue from Q4 wer 58.7 mil 11.1% increase over the 52.8 mil reported. Full year revenue 220.8 mil 10.2% increase over the 200.3 mil in 2019.

The company does business in the US, Asia, Pacific, and Central/Latin America. All strong and or emerging markets. 

My only question at the moment is who is their main competition? Working with Microsoft leads me to believe obtaining market share shouldn't be an issue going forward but as I said that is the last thing I'm concerned about with this little hidden gem.

Colonel after today. All you paper hands should be ashamed with yourself, but you still have time to help your fellow brothers against the Big Bad, Melvin Capital.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

**Conjectures**

I'll describe how Melvin Capital will likely try to countermove their weak position. Everything I write is conjecture, and would be a very low investable thesis but let's continue with the white boarding.

The GME 60C is the beginning and the end for you guys. Huge amounts of call buying and delta hedging occured at this strike. 10s of Millions of shares are linked to these derivatives.

Melvin's Capital goal is to not be forced into a short squeeze. You guys want the the infinite short squeeze to be triggered. MM/Citadel Securities provides the price discovery on how expensive each countermove is for the actors in this game.

Melvin Capital is likely not to double down on naked shorts with the new funds because if he loses in that move, Plotnik's career is over and may face criminal charges for abusing his fudiciary duties by doubling down with more naked short selling.

We saw today how someone forced GME share price to drop over 10% and force halts, thereby dropping off vega and killing off any gamma ramping. It happened over and over. So we know that's what they tactically want to do.

Steve Cohen's, famous hedge fund manager, has a favorite play. He would create massive call and put walls around a strike price to kill off vega and prevent gamma, and collect premium. In ELI5, Cohen would put up massive blocks of expensive puts and calls so that participants would have to churn through them before gamma could be ramped. By the time it happened, theta would have made your positions not profitable. And Cohen would collect the premium as actors tried to hammer through those put and call walls. He basically does this to kill volalitity.

Plotkin was Cohen's right hand man.

So expect Plotkin will use the 2.75B to drive GME price below 60, then he will ressurect massive put/call walls around a strike price and wait out the ITM 60C options across the calendar. This will kill vol and dampen gamma to prevent a gamma squeeze that can trigger an infinite short squeeze.

**Retails counter move**

Retails only chance is to have a big whale on your side to blast threw those put/call walls that will kill vol; or it's a race against time to trigger the gamma squeeze before Plotkin drives the price below 60 and erects the massive put/call walls that make all the ITM 60C expire worthless and dampens anymore gamma ramping to force a short squeeze.

---

BB has some elevated short interest for sure. That short interest may even be increasing. However the float on the stock is massive compared to GME. There are over 550 million available shares of BB, and the short interest is below 100%. While there may be some movement up based on shorts covering, GME is a once in a lifetime thing.

Nothing is the next GME. Not AMC, not NOK, not BB. The large players aren't ever going to be caught this way again in a place where retail investors can screw them, and GME isn't over. If what you want it to participate in that, then you should buy GME.

But I think BB is *fundamentally* more valuable than its current price.

## Current Situation of the Company

BlackBerry, which started as Research In Motion, was the ""original"" smartphone company, before Apple ate them alive. They didn't have the product pipelines or the money to compete against Apple, and the company was nearly killed by the iPhone and later the Samsung Galaxy brand.

Over the last several years, BlackBerry has pivoted into a software security company. They mainly sell security products with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

From Fidelity:

> BlackBerry Limited provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide. The company leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions in the areas of cybersecurity; safety and data privacy; and endpoint security management, encryption, and embedded systems.

Over the last year, BB has re-positioned itself to take advantage of the nascent market of autonomous and intelligent vehicles. (Source: [AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/))

> BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences as well as provide valuable product insights back to the manufacturer.

They also have a partnership with Baidu for that company's Apollo autonomous driving open platform. (Source: [BlackBerry Expands Partnership with Baidu to Power Next Generation Autonomous Driving Technology](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology))

> BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu, whose high-definition maps will run on the QNX® Neutrino® Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).
> 
> ...
> 
> The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu’s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.

Their QNX system is already used in over 100 million cars that are currently on the road, including a direct partnership with [Ford](https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22007012/blackberry-ford-extend-partnership-to-develop-car-software) that they've had since 2016.

They are in the final stages of completing an amazing turnaround as a company, and it looks like they have a good chance of doing it successfully. So what are the challenges?

## Balance Sheet Issues

BB has almost 2/3 of their current ""assets"" tied up in patents. This can be seen on their 2019 balance sheet as ""Intangible Assets – Total: $2.352 billion"". Their assets which are easier to liquidate are nearly exactly their current liabilities ($1.196 billion vs. $1.121 billion), as they added $638 million in debt in FY2019.

Just a few weeks ago, BlackBerry sold 90 of its smartphone patents to Huawei. It also signed a licensing deal with OnwardMobility and Foxconn to allow it's name and software to be used in making a new 5G Android-powered smartphone that has a physical keyboard, filling a small but important niche in the smartphone industry that is mostly untapped at this point.

These moves signal the intent of BlackBerry to leverage parts of its balance sheet that have been mostly sitting idle since 2016 when they exited the smartphone market for good as a manufacturer.

The challenge is that their cash flow and income have been negative or paltry for quite a while. That was never going to turn around until they were able to monetize some of their existing IP and position the company for a solid market segment. At this point, they have successfully done both.

## Earnings

This section definitely depends on your focus and perspective. For instance, BlackBerry's GAAP EPS has been negative more than positive since 2016. But on the other hand, their adjusted actual EPS has beaten consensus estimates for every single quarter going back to Q3 2015.

If you believe in Chen's ability to execute the turnaround, then this seems positive. If you think the company is destined for failure and a slow death, then this seems negative.

## Conclusions

Overall, I think BB is undervalued at its current price. They are very well positioned to take off as autonomous vehicles become more common, and most importantly, they have extremely valuable partnerships in many different markets, including some fantastic access to the Chinese market through their partnership with Baidu.

Autonomous vehicles are a market that doesn't exist yet. Not truly. But many people believe that autonomous vehicles are going to turn into a HUGE segment of the market over the next decade. While car companies (particularly TSLA) provide direct exposure to that, they come with manufacturing risks and other things such as supply-chain risks. TSLA, Toyota, Ford... they could all face issues that simply come down to ""we ran out of good suppliers of Cadmium"" or something similar, while what you want is exposure to autonomous vehicles.

BB has none of that. Their revenue and exposure to the market is entirely within the software, and because of their wide range of partnerships they shouldn't be dependent on any particular manufacturer. I expect to see them reporting positive earnings during FY2021 (though only slightly), and a much more obviously robust performance in FY2022.

Their patent portfolio alone in 2020 was worth about what their market cap was, that's how undervalued this company was due to concern about earnings. Once those earnings turn around, I think the valuation based on *only* fundamentals should put the stock at about $20 *right now*, and about $30-$35 by the end of this year.

There is also a non-trivial chance of a purchase by another company such as Alphabet that wants access to their partnerships, patent portfolio, and machine learning software.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. It is an organization of my own thinking behind the positions I have opened with my money.

Overall, BB benefits from its meme-stock status, and a bit of a short squeeze could happen for sure. But based just on my reading of their business itself, I think the stock has room to as much as triple within a year.

601,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,,1324,g3od5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/g3od5e/options_trading_basics_for_beginners/,1587220111.0,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

I've only been trading a little over a month and I'm learning lessons every day in the market. I wonder if people would be interested in some fairly short videos of me putting on some trades, talking about enter/exit strategies, then talk about the trade as it progresses and finally management and closing/trades.

Would you be interested in this?

Edit: I’m legitimately overwhelmed by the response here. Thank you all for your input. Just to clarify something, I am not *teaching* how to trade options here. Think of this as a vlog trading journal that you can grow with over time. I plan on explaining some concepts and why I make the decisions I do. So far every trade decision I have made has had some lesson to be learned from it. I’m doing this for 2 reasons: to help other people who are going through the same and to have a video log of my trades. I currently keep a paper log too but this will help me see my own thought process evolve over time.

Thanks again! I’m gonna start working on this tomorrow so if you want updates give me a follow on here and I’ll post some updates to my page.",options
604,"GME bulls: *Brace yourselves* for this inevitable (but necessary) temporary setback, and be ready to take full advantage!",,1173,l5ycjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l5ycjl/gme_bulls_brace_yourselves_for_this_inevitable/,1611729412.0,"Disclosure: I’m very long GME since 15 (unfortunately mostly vertical debit spreads but I added a lot later at 50). 

I want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. 

So be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: 

Shorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. 

Remember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. 

Side-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. 

This right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. 

So just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀 

TLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.",options

The point of this is to take a complicated concept and simplify it for people to understand easier.

The first Greek Delta: Delta Categorically tracks price. Delta has one of the biggest roles in options trading, especially for options buyers. Delta identifies how much the options premium will change based off of a $1 move on the underlying stock. So for example if you buy a call with a .30 delta and the stock moves from $100 to $101 your option contracts will rise $0.30 in value.  Delta can also be used to predict the probability of the option expiring in the money. (if you have think or swim there is a preset for this)

Gamma:  Tracks delta's rate of change. If you have a Delta of .30 and a gamma of .05 and the stock moves from $100 to $101 the premium will increase by $0.30. If the stock moves to $102 then the premium will increase another $0.35 because we add delta and gamma together.

Vega: Vega estimates how much the option price will change with every 1% change in  implied volatility. For example if I have a call and the Vega is .04 if implied volatility increases by 1% my premium for the call will increase by $0.04. Many things can cause a move in implied volatility such as earnings reports, political reasons and many more. IV can be a gift or a curse depending on your trade.

Theta: Measures the amount an option will decrease in value for every day that passes. If you have a theta of -0.06 then the option is expected to lose $0.06 in value everyday.

Rho: Measures the rate of change of an option due the interest rate changes. If the contract is $1 and you have a Rho of 1.0 and interest rates change by 1% then your contract will change by $0.01 ",options

For those that want to scan for options activity, you can check out [options flow scanner](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) here.

**AMZN – Amazon Inc**

A player opened a $47 million dollar bet, short straddle, in AMZN last week. They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep. This bet looks like they aren’t expecting earnings to move Amazon that much and are trying to capitalize on the premiums from high volatility at the moment.

**BABA – Baba Holdings**

Big call buyer in BABA last week. Player opened a $55 million dollar position with 18,000 contracts in August 21 CALLs. BABA had a good run up recently, but has dropped slightly since reaching all-time-highs not long ago. This bet is suggesting the player expects for the stock to have another pop in the short-term.

**HUYA – Huya Inc**

Another Chinese stock in play was HUYA. This stock doesn’t normally see a whole lot of unusual options activity, so this trade stood out quite a bit. A player purchased 2,500 CALL contracts at 9% OTM with an expiration in October, 2020. This is a pretty directional bet with a high risk factor due to how far OTM the position is. The position is valued at about $600k and they are expecting the stock to rise over the next 3 months.

**ESTC – Elastic**

Player opened a long position that expires August 21, before the earnings reports for ESTC. ESTC is a cloud/software/SAAS platform, perhaps they are expecting the stock to rise as other tech companies report solid earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/kmkao1ne6ub51.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a529cfbece8d4794fdfa767f2696fe5bf20e3a1

**HD – Home Depot**

Saw some high call volume in HD on Friday. Total value of call positions was about $25 million on Friday where as a typical day for HD option volume is approximately 2-5 million daily. Biggest plays were both for August 21 calls at the 200 and 220 strikes with values of $18 million and $6 million, respectively. HD reports earnings August 18. The player is expecting the stock to have a good run up before earnings as expectations are high for a good quarter.

**MAR – Marriott**

Marriott has been seeing some bullish flow recently. Some positions that caught my eye were multiple positions of players selling PUTs. These could potentially be another leg of a bigger position, but it seems like the player is expecting MAR to have hit a bottom. As long as MAR stays above $85 (now $91) in the short-term then both players will realize maximum profit from their position.

**MRNA – Moderna**

Everyone knows the news of the MRNA vaccine. On Friday, players continued to buy into strength expecting the stock to continue it’s rise up over the next several months. $90 million in calls were purchased on Friday, most positions were relatively far OTM, which shows confidence in the bet.

# Call option explained like a house.

Call options explanation ends up being confusing and filled with  jargon. It is a very easy and powerful concept if understood  correctly.

We are going to explain call options using the housing  market and our view of whether property/house    prices will increase  or decrease. We will go on to explore the different outcomes and risks  of a call option.

## Technical definition of Call Option:

(We will simplify it right after this)

>Call options are financial contracts that give the option  buyer the right, but not the obligation,    to buy a stock, bond,  commodity or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a  specific time period.    The stock, bond, or commodity is called the  underlying asset.    A call buyer profits when the underlying asset  increases in price. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp#what-is-a-call-option)

## Simplifying the Call Option definition:

Your opinion about houses in a particular area is that prices  will go up within 30 days.     Current house price is 1,000. You think  it will go to 1,200.

The owner of the house wants to sell the house at 1,100.

You talk to the house owner and agree that you will pay him 50  today and if by the end of 30 days price    is above 1,100 you “may” buy  the house for 1,100.

This agreement of a price and timeframe in which you may buy the house from the house owner is called a “Call Option”.

&#x200B;

Convert terms used in the example to technical terms:

**Main difference between US-type options and european options is:**

Using our example above:

If the agreement between you and the house owner allows you to buy    the house at the agreed price(1,100) at ***any time***    during the 30 days,    then it is called a US type option.

If the agreement between you and the house owner allows you to buy    the house at the agreed price(1,100) only at ***end of 30 day period***,    then it is called a European type option.

## Benefits of Buying Calls

Once that we understand the profit loss of call buying,    let us understand the benefits:

**Less risk from sudden drop in prices.**

Stock(house in our example) prices can potentially drop a lot     over a period of time.    If you buy a call option on your opinion about  the rise in    price of a stock, your maximum loss is the premium you  have paid i.e.    50 in our example. While if you had bought the  stock(house) and the    price falls to 900. You would be at a loss of  100.

**Potential for bigger profits.**

Price of a stock can potentially rise a lot over a month. Buying     call options can enable you to buy/speculate on 10 units of a     stock when you would only be able to buy 1 unit in conventional     approach of buying stock. If you are right about the stock    you can  potentially make 10 times the profit you would have    made with buying  stock directly. Be aware leverage is a double-edged sword.

## Risks of Buying Calls

**Loosing the premium only to see the stock price go up in a few days:**Timing is one of the biggest    factors in options, if you bought a  call but the price movement did not happen till expiry then your     premium paid is a loss. It is possible to see the same stock go up the  next day or near-term after    taking the loss.You can buy  another call, but now the price movement needs to be enough to cover     the loss from last call and the premium paid for this call.

**Being right about the price movement but wrong about the premium:**Your view of the stock was right, the price moved above your strike price but not enough to a profit i.e.:Stock Price is greater than Strike price but less than strike price + premium paid.

**Lag between delivery of shares and ability to sell them – region specific**Once the call option expires(i.e. settlement date has passed), there  is a chance that you will get delivery    of the shares if the  settlement price is above your strike price. This can be compulsory as  per region, please check    the contract specifications.This  delivery of shares can take a couple of days. If the share price drops  between this time then there    is a chance of loss.

Buying calls conclusion

Call option buying can lead to massive gains in the financial markets  by using leverage however        they require an ability to time an  investment. The risk is loosing your premium paid.

GME has become much harder to borrow with the rates to borrow going up.  This means you are at more risk then usual for early assignment on deeper in the money short calls.

If you are assigned early you will have to pay hard to borrow fees until the position is covered.

If you see your short call is trading with no extrinsic value,  you may want to cover your position.

&#x200B;

Edit to ADD:

Sorry, haven't been able to respond to all questions.

When I say short call, I don't mean just naked short.  If you have a call vertical, a call butterfly, or any spread with a short call you are at risk of early assignment.

If you have been assigned on a short call from a spread, you can either exercise your long call or close the position as a spread (you would place an order to buy the stock you were assigned and sell out your long call).  If there is no extrinsic value left in your long call, easiest is to exercise.  If there is extrinsic value left do the latter.

Make sure your broker hasn't closed out the position for you before you act.

Edit again:  I added that your risk in early assignment is for short calls.  Didn't put this in at first as you can't be assigned on long calls so I didn't think it was necessary, but for those who didn't realize this, this clarifies.",options

Everything also works in real-time, so just change the strikes, expiration, or IV to see the chart instantly update. This makes it very easy to discover how various strategies respond to different conditions! There are over 50 pre-made strategies as well.

624,The Greeks,,836,kvsq6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kvsq6w/the_greeks/,1610461935.0,"The Greeks are a set of risk measures that indicated how exposed an option is to time value decay, implied volatility, and pricing changes in an underlying security. There are five Greek risk measures: Delta, Theta, Vega, Gamma, and Rho:

Delta: This is a measure of the change in an option’s price or premium resulting from a change in the underlying asset. A high Delta option’s premium will increase more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock gains; a high Delta option’s premium will also fall more than a low Delta option’s premium for every $1 the stock loses. For example, if the Delta is 0.6 then for every $1 the stock rises the premium will rise $0.60. Delta is also commonly used when determining the likelihood of an option being ITM at expiration. For example, an OTM call option with a 0.20 Delta has roughly a 20% chance of being ITM at expiration, whereas a deep ITM call option with a 0.95 Delta has a roughly 95% chance of being ITM at expiration. Lastly, Delta is used when determining directional risk. Positive Deltas are long (buy) market assumptions and negative Deltas are short (sell) market assumptions. Neutral Deltas are neutral market assumptions. There are three main things to keep in mind when considering Delta:
- Delta tends to increase as expiration approaches for near or ATM options.
- Delta is further evaluated by Gamma, which measures Delta’s rate of change.
- Delta can also change in reaction to implied volatility changes.

Gamma: This measures Delta’s rate of change over time as well as the rate of change in the underlying asset. Gamma is used to help forecast price moves in the underlying asset. Since Delta values are constantly changing with the underlying asset’s price, Gamma is used to measure the rate of change and provide traders with an idea of what to expect in the future. Since Gamma represents the rate of change of Delta, it is useful for determining the stability of Delta, which can be used to determined the likelihood of an option reaching the strike price at expiration. A good way to think of Gamma is the measure of the stability of an option’s probability. If Delta represents the probability of being ITM at expiration, Gamma represents the stability of that probability over time. Gamma values are highest for ATM options and lowest for deep ITM or OTM options. For example, suppose that two options have the same Delta value but one option has a high Gamma and one has a low Gamma. The option with the higher Gamma will have a higher risk since an unfavorable move in the underlying asset will have an oversized impact. High Gamma values mean that the option tends to experience volatile swings, which is a bad thing for most traders looking for predictable opportunities. An option with a high Gamma and a 0.75 Delta may have less of a chance of expiring ITM than a low Gamma option with the same Delta. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Gamma:
- Gamma is the smallest for deep OTM and deep ITM options.
- Gamma is highest when the option gets near the money.
- Gamma is positive for long options and negative for short options.

Theta: This measures the rate of time decay in the value of an option or its premium. Time decay is the erosion of an option’s value from the passage of time. As time passes, the chance of an option being profitable or ITM lessens. Time decay tends to accelerate as the expiration date of an option draws closer because there’s less time left to earn a profit from the trade. Theta is always negative for a single option since time moves in the same direction. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers. For example, assume an investor is long an option with a Theta of -0.50. The option’s price would decrease by $0.50 every day that passes, all else being equal. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Theta:
- Theta can be high for OTM options if they carry a lot of implied volatility.
- Theta is typically highest for ATM options since less time is needed to earn a profit with a price move in the underlying stock.
- Theta will increase sharply as time decay accelerates in the last few weeks before expiration and can severely undermine a long option holder’s position, especially if implied volatility declines at the same time.

Vega: This measures the risk of changes in implied volatility or the forward-looking expected volatility of the underlying asset price. Vega represents the amount that an option contract’s price changes in reaction to a 1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. While Delta measures the actual price changes, Vega is focused on changes in expectations for future volatility. Higher volatility makes options more expensive since there is a greater likelihood of hitting the strike price at some point. Vega tells us approximately how much an option will increase or decrease in the level of implied volatility. Option sellers benefit from a fall in implied volatility, and option buyers benefit from a rise in implied volatility. Long option traders benefit from pricing being bid up, and short option traders benefit from prices being dig down. This is why long options have a positive Vega and short options have a negative Vega. For example, if the Vega is 0.25 and the implied volatility increase by 1%, then the option’s bid-ask price should increase by $0.25. If the Vega of an option is greater than the bid-ask spread, then the option is said to offer a competitive spread. This is just one consideration, as too high of a spread could make getting into and out of trades more difficult and/or costly. There are three additional points to keep in mind when considering Vega:
- Vega can increase or decrease without price changes of the underlying asset, due to changes in implied volatility.
- Vega can increase in reaction to quick moves in the underlying asset.
- Vega falls as the option gets closer the expiration.

Rho: This measures the change in option premium due to interest rates. For example, if Rho is 0.25 and interest rates are increased by 1%, the price of the contract would increase by 0.25 / $25. If interest rates are decreased by 1%, the price of the contract would decrease by 0.25 / $25.


If anyone is familiar with calculus, you can think of the Delta as the velocity of the contract price(first derivative) and the gamma as the acceleration of the contract price(second derivative). These calculations come from the partial differential equation, Black Scholes model.

625,Former pro trader’s advice,,824,fexh32,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fexh32/former_pro_traders_advice/,1583598719.0,"Hello! Longtime lurker here—love the content. I’m a former high-frequency options trader at one of the big firms in Chicago and wanted to give my two cents of advice for all of you to use. 

1) Professional models are really good. Their volatility pricing, their reaction time—both unreal. Do they get things wrong from time to time? Sure. But unless you’re running serious quant analysis, the good buying/selling opportunities only last a matter of minutes.

2) Execution is important. If you’re going to trade, trade tight markets with high volume. The tightest bid/ask spreads mean you give up the lowest edge per trade. The best place to look is usually monthly expirations for stock options. For some archaic reason, these options have the tightest bid/ask spreads and are more heavily trades, even close to expiration. The worst are usually Monday/Wednesday expirations. Unless you have a specific reason to trade these Monday/Wednesday expirations, you’re wasting money. 

Those are my two main pieces of advice—thanks for reading!",options

Just dropping in a quick strategic analysis on Blackberry. The details of the discussion are applicable for the week ahead and can be found below:

**Expected move: +/- $3.00**

* Upper Expected move: $17.00
* Lower Expected move: $11.00

**Potential move: +/- $3.90**

* Upper Expected move: $17.90
* Lower Expected move: $10.10

**Historical Volatility: 98%**

**Implied Volatility: 167.2%**

* Put-To-Call Interest: 0.30
* 10-year high: $17.21 (Feb-4-2013 the date when Research in Motion changed their name to Blackberry)
* 5-year high: $14.55
* 1-year high: $14.28

**Bullish Trade idea (short-term):**

* 15/18 weekly Bull Call Spread
* Debit: $0.58
* Max Profit Potential: $2.42
* Risk/reward: 4.17
* Breakeven: $15.58
* Max profit occurs above $18 at expiration

**Bullish Trade idea (long-term):** 

* Given the elevated implied volatility and low stock price, it is more prudent to own the equity. 
* Alternatively, $12 February monthly opex puts are trading at $1.40 and can be sold cash secured for an effective ownership price on the stock of $10.60 if assigned (this represents an 11.77% return on risk in less than 1 month)

**Other considerations:** 

* Next ER is in Mid March
* BB has announced partnerships with AMZN, ZM, OnwarMobility and Huawei
* Blackberry owns over 30,000 patents, by far the most of any company in Canada and many of which are applicable to smartphones, which they will no longer focus on. 
* Expect more patent sales, further bolstering their balance sheet.

Here are the things I've learned over the past few years.

**- Always know your numbers:** Be realistic when it comes to returns on your trades. What's a currently high yield savings account out there? 1.25%? 2.50%? Keep in mind those are annual returns for the most part. If you were to take your hard-earned money, learned a skill (for life) and decided to take life/money into your own hands (because no one else out there cares more about your money other than yourself - mind your own business so to speak), then you can beat a regular savings account if you work at it. If you entered a small trade, and gained 5-10% on it and repeated it for say 2 or 3 more trades each day, AND are consistent at it, you should make much better returns over the long-term than let someone else or another financial institution manage for you.

**- Greed kills:** The moment you start to day-trade with options, you may have a winning trade, perhaps even 10 winning trades in a row. This is when you need to be careful. Think of it this way, every morning, before you start to trade, remind yourself what you're really after by day-trading. Extra source of income for the long-term. In order to achieve that goal, you cannot, I repeat, cannot let 1 single trade TAKE OUT YOU OF THE GAME. Trade $10.00 gains over a million trades vs try to make $1,000,000 in 1 single trade. The sooner you start to realize that, the sooner you can refine your daily goals. If your daily goal is to make for instance $200 a day, and you give yourself 4 hours of active trading time, you just simply need to to take that $200 number and split into 1-4 trades (because you'll most likely be able to find/spot opportunities within that 4 hours of active trading time you give yourself). We're talking a mere $50 in profit per trade now at this time (if you were to trade 4 times each day).  If you entered each trade with say $250 or $500, meaning that's your ultimate risk at hand while in the trade, what are the chances you can take out $50 in profit? Of course, we're all not including the fact that no one can have 100% win rate accuracy. That's a given because losing trades WILL happen. But again, what are the chances you can make $50 off a $250 ""bet""? Quite possible wouldn't you agree? So, keep that in mind BEFORE you start your trading day at all times.

**- Accept losing trades:** Yes, losing trades are part of this game. The sooner you realize that you can be wrong and change your mindset, the better you'll get at trading. I'm talking about entering a $150 - $250 position, and accepting that you could lose $50, $100 or $150 off that trade. You need to be prepared to take the loss and move onto the next trading opportunity. In my experience of ""day-trading"" with options, I have and love to see losing trades. It simply means that I am setting myself up properly for trading in general long-term. People that DO NOT accept a losing trade, will eventually cause their own demise in a trade that could take them out of the game (forever). Some people prefer hard stops, but I personally like to train and work on myself when it comes to trading as I would like to hope that I improve daily; so I ultimately make myself press the SELL button when I realize a losing trade. You should try it sometime. It's a great thing. I tend to look at exiting a losing trade as a winning trade because now I can focus and work towards spotting another trading opportunity. Who knows, that next opportunity might make up the losing difference you just experienced and even put you ""back in the green"" for the day. Think positive. Accept losers. It will go a long way.

**- Trade what you're familiar with:** Have a small watch list of stocks you follow and trade daily. I'm talking do not scan, spend hours and hours on other newsletters, group chats or forums to spot the next trade. I consider that to be quite wasteful. Remember why you are trading in the first place (yeah yeah, I get it, some just can't get rid of the rush/addiction to ""gamble""), but that set aside, we're ultimately all in this to enjoy the freedom that comes with day-trading. Eventually you may be able to stop your regular work-life (whether self-employed or through an employer/job), so you can be your own boss. By simply observing those stocks every day, you get a sense of experience/knowledge that others cannot get because they are not spending as much time with them as you are. You understand if for instance stock XYZ tends to sell off in the morning, because it runs all the way back up into the green. You understand if a certain price level for stock ABC is a magnet and tends to have the stock revert back to that level after every 5-10% up or down move over 2-3 weeks period of time. You will gain ""insight"" information that will give you the ""ultimate edge"" in your day-trading. I'd say look for your own stocks. It can be anything that you're dealing with on a daily basis; Companies you understand, you buy products from, anything that interests you, but keep them to a number of perhaps 4-10, and just simply observe them. One or two of them will have a trading opportunity every almost daily. Your job is to spot that opportunity and act, and profit/lose from it.

I can probably add a few more key points in the future, but it's lunch time with family and friends and I gotta run :)

A useful collection of information on many subjects can also be found in the wiki and at the top of the weekly safe haven thread.   The weekly thread works best when we have a chorus of voices pitching in to help guide newcomers, so please visit there and participate if you aren't already.

**Current week's thread:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l4eemi/options_questions_safe_haven_thread_jan_2531_2021


For the newcomers who are joining us due to the recent activity in GME, its important to know that derivatives are not magic money printing products; rather they are one tool of many meant to provide flexibility and liquidity in the market.  As such, they have uses in a variety of strategies and can seem overwhelming and complex at first blush.  It will take you some time and effort to become comfortable with them, so please give yourself some slack and don't dive in head first because of fear of missing out (FOMO).

You'll see a lot of traders here talk about how GME can only go up from here, how it's not a pump and dump, the mechanics of gamma squeezes, and how this is unlike anything that's happened before.  Many of us see these same discussions play out every few months for the ""next big thing"", and most of the time what goes up does eventually come down (see NKLA, TLRY, RKT, QS, etc.).

While we can't and wouldn't discourage you from  joining the fray, you should at a minimum give serious consideration to position sizing, max loss, and how much you are truly comfortable losing.  Please don't mortgage your house to put on your first, second, or even 10,000th option trade.  These resources will help you assess your risk.  You can find these and more in the weekly thread.

I call it ""severely undiscovered"" because the channel is fairly new and most videos have very few views, with a few probably just from me (LOL). But boy, oh boy, let me tell you, almost every single video I watched taught me something or taught me a lot.

**The channel is called** [**Options in Plain English**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXx25ZQw1w2sU1wKv4aRqVw/videos) .

Because I had already watched hundreds of videos from Option Alpha, Tastytrade, option project, etc., I thought I'd skip his Beginner playlist. But after I watched a few in the Advanced playlist, I was curious to hear his teaching on the fundamentals. I was surprised that for topics that appear to be covered in every book and every other Youtube channels I've been exposed to, I still learned something new from his teaching. Let me tell you. His teaching is deeper than everyone else's I have seen. Here is an example of a slide in his Beginner course on [Vega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLZULAT7S9k). Does it get you excited? LOL!

But if you are not into theory, don't let this scare you away. The best part about his teaching is you will gather quickly that he actually has a lot of real world trading experience and know the market nuances very well. An ""old hand"", maybe? Let me give you a couple of examples:

I only just found out that he's active on Reddit, and have been sharing his insights with the community (including answering my own questions). You can just search for him.

I have no affiliation with him. I feel almost embarrassed to be promoting his channel when he's an active user here, because I'm way past the age for being a fan boy/fan girl. I hope he doesn't mind my post. But this recommendation is not about me, or even him. It's really to give back to the community that I have gotten so much help from. While I myself do not have much to offer, I offer you the treasure I found. The rest is up to you. :)

P.S. I posted this in a comment. May I ask you guys to come back and give a shout out if you find value? In this ADHD quick-tip seeking era, deep dive high quality content like what he laboriously put out will never accumulate an earth shattering following, so it is up to us to show our appreciation to keep his motivation up. I for one look forward to seeing more content from him, so I'd hate to see him fade. I have subscribed, smashed every like button I encountered on his videos (if I remembered), and turned on the notification bell. He never asked though.

P.P.S. My final comment to this thread:

&#x200B;

My apologies to the readers who got turned off by my over exuberance. I'm not dumb and can totally see where that came from.

\- I'm too active on the thread. Well, I always see it as basic courtesy to acknowledge other people when they interact with you positively. I always try to do that when I can, but I understand that when it's so concentrated here, it's noisy and looks suspicious. And some people simply do not enjoy seeing others so joyful. I get it.

\- My posts are too well structured and they sound premeditated. Who would go through that trouble?! I do. When I set out to share information with others, I do give it a lot thoughts. My main post was to show clearly what this channel I'm recommending about. My follow up post below, I wanted to show that for any topic that came to my mind that I wanted him to cover, I was able to find it addressed already , AND I hope to help others realize it so that they can do their own search as well.

\- I also recognize that my enthusiasm about sharing the find is not usual, and over the top as some say. That's just me. I've done it for another channel (on some forum outside of Reddit). Where did that come from? I think I have a lot of respect for deep knowledge, and I respect the people who have them, and then respect them even more when I see that they put in a lot of effort to share with others without asking anything back or self promoting. For that reason, when I discover them, I almost have a sense of responsibility or obligation to let other people know. Probably 95% of the people wouldn't care, so I sound like an odd ball.

I also apologize to the channel owner. Having observed how low key he has been, I feel guilty that this thread put him in the spotlight, and then people started questioning HIS integrity because of ME! I have done some defending, but I have nothing more to say to those people any more. As I said, my goal of the post was to share a hidden gem with the community that I appreciate, and I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. I don't think anything more I say can set free those people out of their cynical and conspiratorial mind trap. I'm just sorry that a well-intended post and thread inspires such toxic emotion.

Well, what can I say, I don't have balls of steel, or balls in general, so I get a little affected by negativity. I will try to let it go and move on. Thanks to all those who respond positively. You all are what's good about the community.",options

I guess at 4:14 or 4:15 before the option expired SPY must've dipped below 266.50 because I woke up the next morning before the market opened and saw my balance was up about $140k. I thought it was a glitch with the Etrade app at first but then looked at my portfolio and saw what happened. For some reason I was assigned only 863 of the 1000 put contracts I sold. That's 86,300 shares of SPY which is about $23,000,000 worth. I only had $50,000 in my account so I started panicking and wondering if Etrade would liquidate my account or something, so I put in a limit order of 268 (SPY was trading around 268.12 at the time), hoping the sale would go through immediately. After putting in the order a message popped up saying my order would be put through when the market opened, which I don't understand because I thought you could buy and sell stocks/ETFs during premarket hours. So anyway I was stuck staring at my phone's screen until 9:30 when the market opened. Immediately about half my shares sold for $268 each. The market seemed to be dropping so I lowered my limit for the rest to 267.60 and the rest of them sold for that price. After all that my balance was about $112k higher than it was yesterday. Does anyone know how much interest Etrade will charge me for holding 23 million dollars of SPY for these few hours?

*I noticed that SPY tends to earn about $10 per month, so I buy a +$10 call for SPY a month out and sell when it hits 1K.  I've made 3K the last three weeks.*

So I tried it out, more cautiously, by buying a +$5 call a month out to be conservative.  And I've already gained $300 (%80%) in two days, and switched all my spreads to these.   Whoever you are, thank you, and I'll venmo you a pizza if I ever find you :-D

EDIT:  Just so that people understand something here - not only does this position have a higher margin of profitability for less overall risk than my original positions (already a huge plus), it also means that the SPY downturn that occurred today (ironically right after I wrote this) didn't hurt my investment much at all, whereas my original investments in SPY would been in heavy negatives right now.

EDIT 2:  I do actually sleep, so if I stop responding, I'll do my best to answer any questions when I next see them :-D  For everyone who appreciated this post, happy to help :-D and feel free to DM.  I'm also trying to start writing articles for newbie traders since a lot of people seem to be elitist and rude in the trading subs.

Edit 3:  So to make sure people understand what I meant, when I say +$5 call, I mean ***a call with a strike price five dollars above what the current price is.***  When I say +$10 call, I mean ***a call with a strike price ten dollars above what the current price is.***

FINAL EDIT : So two things - If I didn't answer a question, please just PM me.  I've answered at least two hundred or more between PMs and this thread, and I may have mistakenly thought I answered you and I didn't.  If so, my bad, and PM me and I'll answer you as I can (day job notwithstanding).  Second thing, if you liked my writing or my answers and want to read more, feel free to hit my Medium blog ([https://medium.com/@patrykbg](https://medium.com/@patrykbg)).  I'm starting a blog for beginner investors since so many people were rude, dismissive or obnoxious when I was first starting out, and I wanted there to be a spot where that wouldn't happen.  **New post up just today!**

Final Edit 2: The Return :: Sorry, one last update, just so that people following don't need to scroll down to find out **the status of this play -**

SOLD - ~~1x SPY 9/28 350C~~ \- ~~the +$5 play that started it all~~ \- ***+$397*** *overall profit, went with the 2x because I wanted to get in on some sweet Tesla and Apple action as well.  Mighta even had a 3X but hey, Apple was calling my name, and I had to heed the call.*

SOLD x1, still 2x SPY 9/28 360C - the play that this post recommends - ***+500*** *overall profit as of 9/2 @ 1:40PM, 111% total profit and the sold one I just bought a replacement one with and banked the profit :-D*

2x SPY 9/30 370C - bullish test just to see what happens - ***+$300*** *overall profit as of 9/2, 300% profit, I 3X'ed this biotch!  WOOOO!*

*So to all you haters insisting this wouldn't work, was bad advice, and was more dangerous than using butterknives in a toaster to get bread, where are you now?  I like how a lot of you deleted your comments because you didn't want people to see how wrong you were, I guess?*   ***To everyone else:  Good luck with your trades :-D  Consider this episode closed - I think we can all see how well this went.

My first trades were HTZ Bought 6 Oct 16 6C @ 1.48 $888 and H Bought 2 Aug 21 70C @ 5.40 $1080.

My most profitable strategies were short strangles, short puts, occasionally short calls and deep delta long calls.

My biggest losses were earning plays on TGT and BYND. Lost 10k/27k respectively. The lesson I learned was to be consistent with my losers, so cut em loose sooner.

Some other things that helped me this year were patience, risk management, exploring new strategies, keeping a watchlist and looking out for patterns/trends. The options sub was my #1 source of education when I started. I always asked questions in the noob thread, and probably combed through 80% of it’s history to learn as much as I can. Very thankful for people like redtexture, papacharlie9, maxcapacity, esinvests (Erik) for being mentors to new traders like myself.

I do know I am still an amateur. I will still be a regular on the noob thread, but I wanted to share a bit of my story to cap off the year. I have no friends who actively trade the market :(

WE’RE OFFICIALLY GOOOD!

**UPDATE: Robinhoods Response, they’re working on a UI fix:**

https://imgur.com/gallery/pVHMQFx

**SECOND UPDATE ROBINHOOD CALL:**
Robinhood called and I had a conversation with them. Basically asking me if I was okay and about what had happened. The guy was pretty nice over the phone and asked me to reach out for whatever reason and if I had any other questions. That was most of the conversation though. I explained about me posting here and that everyone helped me with what was going on. Nothing out of the ordinary just a “How are you holding up” conversation and if I had any questions. I’m just relieved it’s over really. Also pretty sure they were calling to make sure I was still alive, even though that sounds horrible to say.

I want to personally thank each and every one of you especially u/MichaelBurryScott who helped me throughout this whole fucking thing and u/chknbscts who helped me out from over at WSBs

Thank you all so much for the helpful advice and amazing comments. You all helped keep me EXTREMELY call compared to what would’ve happened if I were to have gone through this alone

You have no idea how stressful this was the first night of this happening. I received absolutely ZERO sleep and had some pretty dark thoughts pop in my head

I’d like to take this time to reach out to NEW traders and highly HIGHLY recommend you search this sub and ask questions, research and most importantly NOT trade and options until you have an exact idea of how much it is you can both profit, lose and how to execute everything

I would also like to take this time to remind us all that ROBINHOOD is an absolute shit platform that has YET to reach out to me and say anything about this while this sub has handled this situation better than anything I could have ever dreamed of.

Another reminder, LIFE is a precious thing. I’d like to take this time to remind everyone that a couple months ago a 17yr old boy took his life by something exactly like this happening to him. He did NOT reach out for help and instead took his own life because of a bad UI on Robinhood and poor experience with option trading. I have to admit that this situation has taught me some extreme life lessons and I am probably the only person in this world that really understands why that guy took his life...I can’t tell you that I would have the stones to do it to myself but let me tell you this, there were absolutely some insanely dark thoughts that were positioned in my head.


Thank you all. Apart from potentially saving my life you saved me from debt and ignorant positions that I had no business opening in the first place. I am debted to all of you.",options

Recently developed a tool that analyzes options flow from the entire day to make short term predictions of 1-5 days. Wanted to share some of the alerts for the next week with you folks. Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.

# Bullish Alerts

**$BABA**   \- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).

**$CHWY**   \- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

**$TWLO**   \- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**   \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**   \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**

Hindenburg Research says Nikola’s response yesterday was a “tacit admission of securities fraud.”

They go on to say: “We included 53 questions at the end of our report that we believe shareholders deserve answers to. The company promised a full point-by-point rebuttal, but then only responded to 10 of our questions. Of those 10 responses, the company debunked nothing. Instead it either confirmed or sidestepped virtually everything we wrote about, and in some cases raised new unanswered questions...”

Further saying: “In our report, we explained how the company released a video called ‘Nikola One in Motion’, which made it seem that its Nikola One semi-truck was traveling under its own power at a high rate of speed. Angles in the video were edited to make it appear as though the semi was moving on a roadway that was flat, or even uphill. In Monday’s response, the company acknowledged that its vehicle was not functioning under its own power, and instead, was apparently simply showcasing the power of gravity. It claimed that using the term ‘in motion’ dispelled the deceptive nature of the video. We disagree. Beyond common sense, the company referred to the Nikola One as ‘the 1,000 HP, zero-emission Nikola One semi-truck’ in the description of its video. Obviously, the truck can’t have 1,000 horsepower or even 1 horsepower if it doesn’t power itself.”

Until new strikes are listed that takes away the short gamma effect of upside calls on the stock. 

That short gamma effect goes like this, a ton of retail buyers pile into upside calls, and leave the sell side short those strikes. They hedge with stock but as the stock rips higher, more and more stock needs to be bought by those that sold calls (market makers, trading desks). 

A great example, the 60 calls expiring today were trading under 5 cents very recently. Today, they were worth more than $10 with the stock above $70. Imagine what kind of stock needs to be bought to hedge against those now versus when they were initially sold at less than 10 deltas. Add that gamma effect to the short squeeze in the stock and you see why GME has days like today. But as of now, that gamma effect largely disappears above $60 in the stock

This only matters at the moment for GME, new strikes will be listed by Monday, but sort of an interesting options inefficiency I thought was interesting. BTW, here's the current expected move in the stock via Options AI. As you can see most of the movement is being priced in the next week or so. In other words near term options is where all the buying is at the moment:

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I closed up some positions Thursday before close and raised cash which gave me an opportunity to open new positions when some good entries came about Friday on the dip. Still about 40% cash and will look to enter some trades on Tuesday.  


Positions that remain from previous weeks: **COTY, FEYE, GME, JMIA, PLTR**.  
Positions I opened Friday: **CRSR, RKT**

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**CRSR ($38)**

https://preview.redd.it/6f7r7hultyb61.png?width=1804&format=png&auto=webp&s=7009672010f2e417c46e69cacd7d4f0476f1b205

This ticker finds it's way on my short-list of stocks once again. The channel it's trading in is pretty clear and each break-out at the $42 level gets rejected. If we continue to go down expect some support at $35.50. IMO I don't think it will break through for it to become a downward trend. I'm comfortable selling puts at $35 for February 15 going into the earnings report around then.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $35 strike puts sold to open for $3.30 or $330 premium. Return: 10%.  
**Break-even:** I lose if share price goes below $31.70 (20% drop from current level) by expiration.

&#x200B;

**APPS ($56)**

https://preview.redd.it/2xmelenmtyb61.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ad57c2cffc2398c2afbe609260437827f1889a3

APPS nearing the mid-way point of the strong upward channel it's been in. I wouldn't be surprised if it begins to trade sideways and consolidates after the share price doubled since November. Earnings are also coming up relatively soon. I will sell the put the week after earnings anticipating a period of consolidation and sideways action before the next move higher and maybe a run going into earnings day.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 7.5%  
**Break-even:** $46.25

&#x200B;

**PINS ($69)**

https://preview.redd.it/qq4ny5h4uyb61.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=55a8536a8f0ffdc2a9ed77ffc81a9e48eb9dc932

Finally an entry point into PINS. This ticker really took off over last summer and into the fall, but since December it's been pretty flat. It's right on the $70 level of supp/resistance. If this level breaks down we could see it go back to $65 area. I'll be confident selling my puts at $66 for the week after earnings in mid February. This will give me plenty of time should the stock consolidate or if we get one more push higher going into earnings.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $65 strike puts sold to open for $5.40 or $540 premium. Return: 8.5%.  
**Break-even:** $59.50

&#x200B;

**DKNG ($53)**

https://preview.redd.it/htvoqv65uyb61.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f5b450e09154c4613692d608d24e7231a0c884

DKNG isn't my favorite to sell puts on because IV isn't as high for the return I could get, but it's been fairly reliable in terms of how it trades. Trend lines on this chart are going back to May instead of just the last 2-3 months. Like clockwork it's stayed within the channel for several 6 now. It is at the top of the channel, but could be due for a breakout if it follows the lead of PENN. Government will be looking for revenues and one of the easiest ways to do this moving forward will be to legalize sports-betting everywhere they can and tax the hell out of it. I am bullish long-term on this industry and really don't mind being assigned shares. I might sell closer to ATM puts here 5 weeks out and try to get an extra kick in premium.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $2.65 or $265. Return: 5.3%.  
**Break-even:** $47.35

&#x200B;

**SNOW ($290)**

https://preview.redd.it/y4atwfp5uyb61.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ac8ea6e334866d14bfdab253a20ded8432bd99c

I always liked SNOW, but never got in due to concerns of valuation. For the price action it was experiencing post IPO it also never really had enticing IVs to sell puts against either, which was somewhat strange. Now that the swings in share price the stock is experiencing are narrowing IMO it could be a good time to sell puts with a long-term mindset. This would enable me to get in on some shares at a good price should I be assigned.

  
**Positions on the watchlist**

650,IMPORTANT FOR NEW TRADERS: UNDERSTANDING HOW MARKET MAKERS WORK,,677,iqemik,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/iqemik/important_for_new_traders_understanding_how/,1599779383.0,"Given that there seems to be a large misconception of what market makers are, I felt it prudent to share some information. I often here the phrase ""the market makers just want to take your money and keep the stock away from $X price."" This is inherently incorrect.

Market making is the identification of buyers and sellers with the intention of allowing them to consummate transactions. It is all done algorithmically.

Exchanges offer rebates to market makers in exchange for those market makers providing liquidity in different markets – they will pay MMs to hold short or long positions that provide liquidity in the market

**Example:** A person wants to sell her stock for $51.00, but the current best offer (bid) is $49.00. If another market participant was desperate enough to purchase the stock, they would just move the bid to the ask. In this case, the liquidity provider is the participant who posted the $51.00 ask, meaning that they provided supply of that stock, which was sold.

If the algorithm decided that the fair price was $50.75 and the buyer was satisfied enough to purchase the asset at $50.75, the transaction would be consummated, and the seller would receive a rebate (in the form of a payment for their order flow)

Some of this fee would come from the buyer (in the form of commissions, hence why when you hit the bid or ask, you are charged a higher fee with most brokerages, but when you leave your order open at the bid or ask and it is taken up on, you pay a lower commissions since you helped to provide liquidity)

There is essentially an algorithmic hunt for rebates occurring.

[Diagram depicting Market Maker activity in a transaction](https://preview.redd.it/h7mh5rifjem51.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f810d26d65dcf94e103e0d31cf86d90edb5bff0)

In the options markets, for instance, MMs are now holding the majority of the positions that buyers and sellers are trying to either accumulate or offload.

These market makers are much more important because of their size and due to their large positions, which they are required to hedge to maintain delta neutrality.

Given the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily into market rallies).

Conversely, **market makers cause exaggerated selloffs when the market declines, which is why markets fall so much faster than they tend to rise, because they rapidly attempt to hedge their positions that they are short on the way down.**

Market makers basically create pressure points in the market through their activities and they exert the most pressure when rapid moves occur, further amplifying these moves.

Some of the largest market makers are: Virtu Financial, Citadel Securities, Two Sigma Securities, Susquehanna, Tower Research Capital, Jump Trading, DRW, Hudson River Trading, among others.

653,Newer Traders Watch The Cycles,,653,h92fph,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/h92fph/newer_traders_watch_the_cycles/,1592171065.0,"Hi, this is my first post in options so my apologies if I don't hit all the guidelines.  I've been trading options for right at 30 years now.  I focus about half on directional trades (my mentor taught me on futures, so the momentum strategies always stuck with me) and half on premium selling.  Example, if a stock has 8, 21, 34, 55 and 89 EMAs on the daily chart that are all stacked positive, I will buy delta 70 calls 30 to 60 days out and close out half on a retest of resistance and hold half for a move through resistance and to the 1.272% Fib extension.  The opposite setup for shorts and buying puts.  I'm also a huge fan of selling premium, typically call credit spreads at resistance and put credit spreads at support, usually 10 days out as I'm looking for rapid premium decay.

I'm posting this as I see there is a ton of new people in the markets.  While nobody can say exactly what is going to happen next, keep in mind that the cycle below always repeats itself.  As a general rule, if a stock is above its daily 21 EMA I will buy the dip (buy calls, sell put credit spreads).  If it closes below its daily 34 EMA, I will sell the rip (buy puts, sell call credit spreads).

Last, NFLX is a market proxy.  Whatever NFLX does, the market follows about a week later.

Some notes on the chart below based on comments.  Think of this as the emotional roller coaster traders are going on.  You can apply this same idea to a single stock or the markets as a whole.  You can also apply this to different time frames.  This same ""cycle"" can happen every day on a 1-minute chart as day traders go through the greed, delusion, fear cycle on every trade.  I tend to watch this on the daily and 30-minute charts.  A ""capitulation"" on a 30-minute chart is often a great buy signal on a daily chart.

Hope it helps!

[The psychological\/emotional cycle](https://preview.redd.it/u4v70sgg3y451.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc5af0133fb6e5d2b5bd0e7c7f233199e4f20f8)

Note, based on the questions below I'm adding this daily chart of the QQQ.  Yellow = 8 EMA, White = 21 EMA, Purple = 34 EMA, Thick Yellow = 200 SMA.  EMA = exponential moving average.  SMA = simple moving average.

As a general rule of thumb: I look to ""buy the dip if the 8, 21, and 34 are stacked on top of each other.  I will buy pullbacks (sell put credit spreads, buy in the money calls) into the 8, 21 and 34 EMAs.  Stop loss is a close below the 34 EMA.

Once the 8 EMA crosses below the 21 and 34, I will short rallies (sell call credit spreads, buy puts) into the 8, 21 and 34 EMAs, with a stop as a close above the 34 EMA.  If a full position is 9 lots, I like to scale in 3 at each level.  This means many times I don't end up with a full position.

Does this work every time?  No.  Is it an effective road map as to where we are in the markets and if it is ok to still ""buy the dip?""  I find that it is.

Where are we now?  On the daily QQQ, they are all still stacked positive so buying the dip is fine.  Just look for the 8 EMA to cross the 21 as that typically kicks off steeper pullbacks and sell-offs and can run people over if they aren't aware.

I also use this same idea on 30-minute charts for 1 to 3-day trades.   I posted a 30M chart below.

[QQQ Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wwcyqv8kiz451.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cd1fb96ece54307e905e03131d337f19688642b)

On the 30M chart, it is going to be ""whippy"" but you can use the same philosophy for shorter-term trades as well as use it as a heads up for ""pullback to the daily 21 ema"" on the daily chart.  i.e., once the 8 crosses the 21 and 34 on the 30M, look for a pullback to the 8, 21 and possibly 34 EMAs on the daily chart.

[QQQ 30M Chart](https://preview.redd.it/shxgymykkz451.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=98bc465f55ba601af810fd20dff0a6de7bf976ab)

Based on the above, I could buy calls on a stock like TSLA on the daily chart, but buy puts on the QQQ on the 30-minute chart for a short term trade.  This is also a nice ""hedge"" (long a stock, short an index) in case the market sells off hard.

Last thought: As a newer trader, it is important to understand what your brain should look like ""while in a trade.""  Just because we stare at a chart and hope it will do something, doesn't mean it will do what we want.  The only certainty is uncertainty.  Instead of focusing on the fear of the unknown, focus on the risk of the unknown.  Know in advance how much you are willing to risk on an idea.  When in doubt, get out.  Re-entry is only a commission away.

655,Thought I'd share a project I just finished - 3D options plots with python,,647,gvmluu,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gvmluu/thought_id_share_a_project_i_just_finished_3d/,1591156836.0,"EDIT: [functionality has been extended to run as a GUI in a web browser](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gvmluu/thought_id_share_a_project_i_just_finished_3d/fswkka0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).  This is great because now any plots that have been generated in a session will persist.  Makes it easier to qualitatively compare different tickers, or see how one ticker evolves through time.  Pretty cool stuff.  I added a screen capture of it to the linked examples down below.

I've always thought there's gotta be a better way to 'see' what's going on in the option chain than just scrolling through a wall of numbers, so I wrote a python script that plots option chain information in a 3D space ([code here](https://pastebin.com/GbfbY6eN)).

This information includes:

* price
* volume
* open interest
* every greek in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Formulas_for_European_option_Greeks) table (minus dual delta & dual gamma)

When you run the code you'll be prompted for inputs in the console.  The first prompt is to choose plotting mode or single option mode.

**Single option mode**

* calculates standard greeks & IV of an option given the usual inputs
* mostly a tool to cross check values with brokerage provided values

**Plotting mode**

* you'll be prompted with a series of inputs
   * *ticker symbol*
   * *which set of parameters to plot*
      * standard set = price, volume, open interest, IV, delta, gamma, vega, theta
      * nonstandard set = rho, charm, veta, color, speed, vanna, vomma, zomma
   * *which price to use*
      * mid price or last traded price
   * *which type of options to plot*
      * puts, calls, or both
   * *which moneyness to plot*
      * ITM, OTM, or all options
   * *risk-free rate*
   * *starting time to use in the time to expiration calculation*
      * you can just tell it to use the current time, or specify a time (time to exp is calculated at the minute resolution btw)
      * example of when you might want to specify a time: it's Sunday, the prices will be from EOD Friday, so the time to exp should be calculated from the starting point of EOD Friday
* option data is then pulled from Yahoo! Finance, and parameters are calculated & plotted in a series of 3D subplots

[Here are some examples](https://imgur.com/a/njqZ3TS) of what you will see when the plots are generated.

At the bottom of the examples you will see I've included a guide on how to run this for those who might not be familiar with programming.

**Here are the (easiest IMO) steps to run this code if you want to but don't know how:**

1. Download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (this is how you get python and the required packages)
2. Open the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) development environment (Anaconda should install it by default -- if it doesn't then just install it from within Anaconda)
3. Install the yfinance package.  To do this, in the console just type in: ""pip install yfinance"" (without the quotes) and hit enter.
4. Paste the code into the default 'temp' file (note - if you save the code, the file has to have a .py extension)
5. Hit the green play button (or the F5 key)

This was mainly meant to be an educational project -- both from an options and programming perspective.

For example:

Even though Yahoo! provides implied volatility, I still calculate it manually using a bisection algorithm. I started with Newton-Raphson for speed, but as I found out, it's really hard to make it converge for *every* deep ITM option.  Bisection is technically slower but always converges given that IV is between the two initial guesses.  I also thought it would be a good idea to expose myself to the higher order greeks.

Since I'm used to creating more 'procedural' scripts, I wanted to get familiar with an 'object-oriented' programming style -- writing an 'option contract' class made things so much easier to handle.  This was also good practice for handling a lot of data with complex layers.  A next possible step would be making the graphs continuously update in real time, but that seems like more work that I don't want to do right now lol.

I tried to provide good commenting and docstrings, but let me know if something is wrong.  This is mainly in reference to the descriptions I gave and the formulas for the higher order greeks -- can't really validate the numbers with a brokerage like I can for the standard greeks.

Edit: I should also add that if the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) package ever breaks, then this will stop working.

Edit 2: [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/fy22fe/spy_options_trading_from_150330_pm_blue_call_red/) post was also motivating and gave me the push to start working on this

Edit 3: should clarify not *every* single greek in the Wikipedia table is plotted, but every Greek has the formula entered into the option class, so the code can be modified to plot any of them

Edit 4: thanks for the awards

As always (if only it didn't have to be so), the estimates are subject to changes in IV, although if your target date is an expiry, the most profitable options tend to be expiring that day anyway, so should be fairly accurate since the option's value will be mostly intrinsic.

===============

\+ve = positive

\-ve = negative

===============

**DELTA**

* Rate of change of option price per $1 move in the underlying.
* ITM options have higher delta as the probability of ITM is higher.
* OTM options have a lower delta as the probability of ITM is lower.
* Delta is loosely associated with the Probability of ITM.
* Delta will be 0 for OTM options and 1 for ITM options at expiry.
* Delta mimics # of shares.
* 1 Long Share = 1 Delta. 100 Long Share = 100 Delta.
* 1 Short Share = -1 Delta.
* Delta is directional bias.
* \+ve delta (bullish) means a bias toward stock price going higher.
* \-ve delta (bearish) means a bias toward stock price going lower.
* Higher Probability of ITM means lower extrinsic value i.e. higher delta less extrinsic value.

**Delta Neutral & Beta Weighting**

* Delta of +/- 0.001 \* your net liquidity is considered delta neutral
* Beta weight with SPY to find the total deltas
   * Example: [https://imgur.com/gallery/KYRuhMv](https://imgur.com/gallery/KYRuhMv)
* You can add or remove positions to make your portfolio delta neutral.
* You can hedge the position with high +/- deltas to make your portfolio delta neutral.
* Add or Remove positions in a product based on its correlation with SPY
* If an underlying is negatively correlated to SPY, go bullish to get negative beta weighted deltas and vice versa.
* If an underlying is positively correlated to SPY, go bullish to get positive overall beta weighted deltas, and vice versa.
* Higher correlation with SPY, the higher effect of the underlying deltas on the overall beta weighted deltas.

&#x200B;

**GAMMA**

* Rate of change of DELTA.
* GAMMA: what the future DELTAS are going to be.
* When you sell options, you will gain -ve GAMMA.
* \-ve GAMMA implies that you are +ve THETA.
* \-ve GAMMA is inversely proportional to +ve THETA
* ABS(GAMMA) should not be greater than ABS(THETA)

&#x200B;

**VEGA:**

[https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/everyday-trader/episodes/greek-efficiency-vega-01-25-2017](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/everyday-trader/episodes/greek-efficiency-vega-01-25-2017)

* How much the option price will move if the underlying IV goes up/down by 1%
* Shorting Premium = Short Vega (-ve Vega) = Short IV
* High IV = High Premium.
* More DTE = More Vega (Options more sensitive to volatility)
* IV is mean-reverting. IV is high when the stock goes down or there is fear in the market or some pending news on the UL.
* IV is low if the UL keeps going up.
* Vega Risk:
* As a premium seller, when you sell a lot of bullish premium (ex: short put spread), you expose yourself to a lot of negative Vega.
* Selling a lot of bullish premium gives Positive Delta and Negative Vega.
* VEGA and DELTA has a natural inverse relationship
* When UL crashes IV increases: Profits when -ve DELTA & +ve VEGA
* When UL rally IV decreases: Profits when +ve DELTA & -ve VEGA
* Having a ratio of 2(VEGA): 1(DELTA) helps us to Hedge against vega risk.
* Hedge by adding Positive Vega OR
* Hedge by adding Negative (Short) Delta

&#x200B;

**THETA:**

[https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/everyday-trader/episodes/greek-efficiency-theta-01-24-2017](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/everyday-trader/episodes/greek-efficiency-theta-01-24-2017)

* Time decay: how much potion will lose value each day - works on holidays as well
* All extrinsic value is time value.
* ATM options hold their extrinsic value the longest.
* Closer to expiration:
* Theta grows faster and is larger for ATM options.
* Theta for OTM/ITM options shrinks faster, as the extrinsic value has already dissipated during the life of the option.
* ***Time Decay starts to decay best at 45 DTE and slows down at 10 DTE (This is based on tasty trade studies, there can be other factors at play here which can affect the rate of decay)***
* Less Theta on Theta based option strategy could mean that there is very less extrinsic value left in the trade
* This could mean that the Option is completely ITM or OTM
* Look to get out of this trade
* \> than $1 in Theta is good, if < $1, there could be very less extrinsic Val left, get out of that trade, put a new trade.
* Selling premium to get Positive Theta is not always the answer:
* Selling premium, you can get Negative Vega which can get us in Vega Risk if IV drops
* More about Vega Risk in Vega Section.
* **You can be long in an option trade and still have +Theta and +Vega**

* For Example Long Call Spread: Bullish Trade
* Buy very ITM option which has very less extrinsic value (OTM/ITM options has very low Theta)
* Sell ATM option which has very High extrinsic value (ATM options has very high extrinsic i.e. Theta)

661,Bet on the recovery of the travel industry with this 1 yr option play,,626,kxxrrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kxxrrd/bet_on_the_recovery_of_the_travel_industry_with/,1610727535.0,"The history of financial markets tells us that these good times won’t last forever. Eventually, a significant correction will come along to rain on the parade.

That said, I believe select sectors of the market – like 5G stocks and battery metals plays – will continue to zigzag higher amid the volatility.

Given the robust travel recovery I’m anticipating later this year, I’m recommending a great company in the sector:

**Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, a technology leader in the travel industry, is one of the travel industry’s “Big 3” global distributions systems (GDS).

**Amadeus IT Group SA (AMADY)** and the privately held Travelport are the other two. Together, these three companies make up 97% of all travel bookings worldwide.

Spain-based Amadeus is the largest of the three. It processes about 40% of travel bookings worldwide. Texas-based Sabre is No. 2, with a 35% market share. Travelport is No.3, with a 22% market share.

**More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Every major travel website also uses Sabre. The company’s client list is a “who’s who” of the travel industry:

* **Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG):** Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars
* **Expedia Group Inc. (EXPE):** Orbitz, Travelocity, [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/), [TripAdvisor.com](http://tripadvisor.com/), [SeatGuru.com](http://seatguru.com/), [Cheaptickets.com](http://cheaptickets.com/)
* **Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)**
* **Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT)**
* **Marriot International (MAR)**
* **Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H)**

In all, Sabre’s system processes 2.5 million bookings every minute.

Sabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre’s revenues also increase. The connection between the two is very close and predictable.

Therefore, when the COVID pandemic torpedoed travel activity, Sabre’s revenues tumbled. The company’s second-quarter revenues collapsed more than 90% year-over-year.

Not surprisingly, Sabre’s share price also collapsed.

But that vicious cycle is becoming a virtuous cycle of rising travel activity… and rising Sabre revenues. From the second quarter to the third quarter, revenues more than tripled.

And this favorable trend is certain to continue strengthening in 2021.

There’s no mystery here. As the pandemic recedes, travel activity will increase… and Sabre’s revenues will climb. The share price should follow.

Once travel activity recovers to pre-COVID levels, Sabre’s share price could easily double from current levels.

But the company has not been simply sitting on its hands during the last 10 months, waiting for the inevitable recovery. Instead, it has taken decisive steps to fortify its competitive moat.

Specifically, it has collaborated with Google to migrate its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud. Sabre followed up that initiative by partnering with Google last fall to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology platform that is an industry-first.

As Sabre explains:

>*The technology, known as Sabre Travel AI, is infused with Google’s state-of-the-art AI technology and advanced machine-learning capabilities that will help its travel-industry customers to deliver highly relevant and personalized content more quickly.*

Sundar Narasimhan, president of Sabre Labs, further explains:

>*Sabre Travel AI is a game-changer. We are proud to be working with Google to build technologies that will seek to re-define the way travel companies do business, and turn the insights derived from analyses into repeatable, scalable operations…With the creation of Sabre Travel AI, we are rebuilding our platform on cloud-native, data-driven technology that can be integrated into the existing and future products that Sabre offers. We are combining Google Cloud’s infrastructure, AI and machine-learning capabilities with Sabre’s deep travel domain knowledge to create, not next, but third-generation solutions that we believe are smarter, faster and more cost-effective – a first-of-its-kind in travel.*

The company expects to integrate Sabre Travel AI into certain products in its existing portfolio and begin rolling them out into the market over the next few months.

From an earnings perspective, the Wall Street community expects Sabre to generate about $300 million in gross earnings (EBITDA) next year, and then ramp up to more than $600 million in 2022.

If the company hits those targets, the stock would be trading for 12 times 2021 EBITDA and six times 2022 EBITDA.

But I expect earnings to ramp up more quickly than that. I also expect the company’s technology and AI investments to amplify the company’s recovery and growth trajectory over the next couple of years.

$1 billion of EBITDA by 2023 is feasible.

One word of caution: The company’s balance sheet isn’t bulletproof. It has “B-rated” credit, which puts Sabre deep into junk territory.

That said, only $500 million of the company’s $5.6 billion in debt outstanding comes due over the next two years. Offsetting that near-term obligation, Sabre is sitting on more than $1.5 billion in cash.

In other words, it possesses ample liquidity to ride out the rest of the COVID storm… unless the storm rages anew and lasts well into 2022.

**Bottom line:** I consider Sabre to be an excellent speculation on recovering travel. To make this play, I’m recommending a one-year call option on the stock.

**tl;dr:** **Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, is a tech leader in the travel industry. **More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Sabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre’s revenues also increase and the share price should follow. It is also using AI to become more efficient and thus more profitable.

*Buy the* ***Sabre Corp. (SABR) January 2022 $12 call options*** *for $3.60 or less. The current offer price is $3.30.*

Every once in a while it seems that thinkorswim doesn't trigger a passed alert, so this is just a helpful insurance measure.**

Anyway, channel alerts.  I imagine other tools have something similar, but I've been using thinkorswim for a while and somehow never learned this basic thing.  I wanted to teach other people who might be in the same boat.  Everyone knows about alerts, right?  You can right click the stock chart, set an alert, and have a bell go off if the stock goes above (or below, if you request that) a certain point.

However, in some cases I find myself continually wasting time adjusting alerts.  A stock rises, and I adjust my upper and lower alert levels so I know when something happens.  Then it rises some more, and I adjust again or set new alerts as the trend continues.  So, what you can do is middle click a chart, choose the line tool (2 down, left column), and draw a trend line roughly at the top or bottom of the trend you're following.  Then right click the line and choose redraw as channel.  That will let you move the mouse and click to place the other side of the channel.  Once it is placed, you can left click the channel and adjust the square points to widen, narrow, move, or tune it as you wish.

Finally, the really cool thing:  **You can right click the channel and choose ""create alert with drawing"".**  You can then select a condition like ""crosses"" to alert you when the stock crosses a line.

The result:  https://abload.de/img/channel_alert7ekgr.png

Now you don't have to keep fiddling with your alerts until the stock does something outside the expected trend.  Have fun!

If you use 13F filing data in your investing research then please take a few minutes to read this important message.
You may have already seen the SEC proposal https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml?__s=cvwgmhfkxsnsnrbvs6py to dramatically raise the required reporting threshold for 13F filings.  

This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion!  

To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers.  $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight.  When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of [the US] securities markets.”  Taking this data away will have the opposite effect.  Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets.

One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to this proposal.  https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10
The proposed rule change would be a loss for all of us - it would enable more corruption and opaqueness.

The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. This can only hurt small trades/investors and provides little to no benefit or savings.

Comments are already pouring into the SEC.  I am urging everyone to please post a comment on the proposal to the SEC site linked below.  Why should we care?  How are we impacted by this?  Below are some issues to raise.  Please mention them in your comments to the SEC and to your representative in Congress:
Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.
​
 

-	The “justification” for the rule change is highly questionable.
-	When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor
-	Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.
-	In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The S&P suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

667,My SPX Weekly Premium Selling That Dominates the Market,,600,jm2tgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jm2tgy/my_spx_weekly_premium_selling_that_dominates_the/,1604239809.0,"I've been trading stocks for \~15 years and options for \~10. I have a full-time job and just do this on the side, but I've seen and tried a lot of stuff.

One of my favorite trading strategies involves selling SPX put credit spreads around 9-10 delta (2-5% OTM), 2 days to expiration. Crazy, right? Yeah, sounds like it. But bear with me while I lay out the nitty-gritty. I like the strategy so much that I've decided to (finally) lay it out in full detail for others to learn.

My inspiration for this started after reading and following Karsten's ""Passive income through option writing"" from [EarlyRetirementNow.com](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/). He lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than I ever could, so if you like what you see here, go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what I'm doing.

**What I Do**

Every Monday, Wednesday, & Friday, I sell (open) new put credit spreads on SPX that expire at the closest expiration. So, Monday, I sell SPX spreads that expire Wednesday. Wednesday, I sell spreads that expire Friday. Friday, I sell spreads that expire Monday. I hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration. 95% of the time, these expire worthless and I collect full premium. The other 5% of the time, I suffer a small or large loss. Over the long run, the expected return blows the market out of the water....which leads me to:

**Expected Return**

I've been running this since May 2019 and am averaging something around **150% APY** based on max risk for the spread. It's absurd. Don't believe me? My full trade log is published [here](https://wealthyoption.com/trades), and I update it in real-time. (Yes, that's my website. No, I'm not selling any kind of product/service there. More on that later)

**Risk & Drawdown**

This massive positive return doesn't come without a cost, of course. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And the cost here is that, yeah, while annual return is a ridiculous 150%, max drawdown can be 100% or more. ***Whaaaaat?!*** Yeah, that's right. While these spreads expire worthless 95% of the time, the other 5% can result in huge losses. These losses can accumulate up to 100% or more depending on the environment.

So this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account, right? Well, it is if you allocate too much capital to it. But if you keep your allocation small (which I do), then a 100%+ drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio. I personally only allocate about 10% of my total portfolio to this. What that means is that if/when this trading plan suffers a 100% loss, that only represents 10% drawdown for my portfolio, and I can tap into my other investments to ""replenish"" this trading plan.

These massive losses do happen, but they don't last long. I ran this very strategy through COVID-19 when VIX moved from 13 to 85 in a month, and my max drawdown was ""only"" about 125%. I reloaded from my other investments, and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in 2020 before the market itself did...after I went down 125%.

**Pennies, Meet Steamroller, Right?**

Yeah, this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. There's nothing inherently wrong with that IF:

1. The pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away
2. You limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you, it doesn't destroy you

\#1 - I collect around 2.3% premium per position compared to max risk (spread width). 95% of the time, they expire worthless, so I keep the full 2.3%. The other 5% of the time, I suffer what is usually a large loss, averaging around 20%. Do the math here: 95 \* 2.3 is 220% gain on the wins. 5 \* 20% is 100% loss on the losers. 220% - 100% makes for a very positive expected return...So that takes care of #1. The pennies I collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me.

\#2 - I only allocate 10% of my overall portfolio to this. When the steamroller hits me and results in a 100% loss for the strategy, I'm not wiped out. That's only 10% drawdown on my account, which is easy to recover from. This is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller. If you just keep allocation in check, it's *okay* to get hit by a steamroller every now and then.

**Trade Process - Timing & Strike Selection**

The process here is simple. Every M/W/F afternoon, open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration. Monday's position expires Wednesday. Wednesday's position expires Friday. Friday's position expires Monday. My short strike is around 9-10 delta. My long strike is 100-150 points below that. This results in a short strike around 2% OTM in low IV environments and 5% OTM in high IV environments. The long strike will be 5-10% OTM, again depending on IV. It'll be farther out as VIX rises.

You only suffer max loss if the S&P500 drops 5% in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere (VIX < 15), or if S&P500 drops 10% in a day or two ***after*** freefall has already started. In 18 months, and with VIX rocketing to 85 during that timeframe, not once has one of my spreads even seen max loss....I'm sure it'll happen at some point, but if didn't happen in 2020, I'm curious to see when it would happen.

**Why SPX**

* 3 expirations available every week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
* Highly liquid
* Cash-settled. No underlying given to me on assignment.
* Low trading fees (for me personally - your mileage may vary)
* Beneficial tax treatment (60/40% long-term based on IRS 1256 contract straddles)
* Less ""paperwork"" to file for taxes. Futures and index options aggregate together on IRS tax forms, eliminating 200 line items from this trading strategy in a year

SPX is awesome.

**Alternatives to SPX**

Some of you may not have access to SPX options. Or your account isn't large enough to be handle SPX options. They are huge. A single contract represents $300k notional. The cash-settlement and risk-defined trades help diminish the impact of size, but it's still a lot of underlying to carry around. /ES (futures) are half the size and should work as well (just be sure you understand fees, assignment, and liquidity first). SPY can also work and is even smaller than /ES. Again, understand assignment of shares and fees. You also lose the tax benefit with SPY. But on smaller accounts, this may be the only viable option.

**More Reading + Full Trade Log and Performance History**

I set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy. It's not an interactive website or anything. I'm not selling anything or pushing a service/newsletter. It's just a place where I can define the strategy in way more detail than I've done here, and also a place where I can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history. To learn more about the strategy and see actual trades/performance, check out the website:

I am ***not*** selling or advertising anything on that site, whether my own stuff or somebody else's. Yes, there's a donate page up there, but that's not why I created the site and not why I posted this. But if you find this, love it, and want to return the favor, there's at least that option.

**Questions / Suggestions**

If you're interested in this but have questions/concerns, fire away. I like to teach people, and I'm here to help.

Or, if you're a pro or tried something like this before and see or know something that I'm missing, let me know that as well. Try to blast holes in my trading plan! I feel good enough about it now to finally share with the masses....but if there are any glaring holes or flaws, I want to know what those are.

**Don't trade until you understand:**

* You can lose your entire contract value when buying.
* You can lose a lot of money when selling ""naked"", theoretically unlimited.
* How option expiration works.
* Theta (decay) and how it works.  This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling.  [https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)
* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.
* Understand all the greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)
* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.
* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good youtube videos on most theta strategies.  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  Theta Gang 4 life.
* Understand that WSB is gambling and factor in the information accordingly.  That sub is hilarious, but be careful with meme stocks.
* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!
* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.

&#x200B;

**Basics / Mechanics**

* Understand the 4 ""main"" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex option strategies are based off these in some way.
* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock of if you own an underlying longer term option; see PMCC later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and often a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life.
* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold ""naked"" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as risk.

&#x200B;

**General Tips (Save these for later):**

* **Don't EVER leave spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)**
* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).
* As you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it separated among several stocks.  Don't go all in on one thing ever
* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.
* Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.
* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a ""new"" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/
* Consider using stop losses to lock in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  In December I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls and I ""lost"" \~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big don't get too greedy.
* Incrementally enter positions on large rises / falls.  This helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.  This will also help you avoid ""chasing a falling knife"".  This also ties into having a plan.  I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.
* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.
* On gains, consider taking profits and ""rolling up"" or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).
* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  Close some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes on a tear.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below it's current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.
* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption was incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (buy another call / put).
* Don't try to daytrade, especially with options.  It's incredibly statistically unlikely to be profitable.
* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me loss my hair; luckily it eventually came back.
* Learn about wash sale rules.  They suck and are very easy to activate with options.  This will eliminate your ability to write off losses.  Over trading can easily cause wash sales.
* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.
* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.
* When selling (or buying) look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your strikes and exit points.
* Once you have a good amount of experience, check out LEAPs and poor man's covered calls, they're cool (see below)
* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.
* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.
* If selling options, it is okay to close early after a large gain with many DTE.  See TT videos / strategy on this.
* As you start to sell options and get more experience in general you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will click one day and most/all the greeks and overall market dynamics will become almost second nature.
* If selling, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.
* Stagger strikes for safety / diversity (optional).
* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I do like playing on earnings run up, but that can be risky.
* When selling, if you hold through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards devaluing the option.  However, if the news is good and the stock is way above the strike IV crush won't help you.
* **I repeat this on purpose: Don't EVER leave spreads open on expiration day, close them.  If you don't close, they better be VERY far from the strike on a non-volatile stock.  In after hours a stock can jump/dip below your strike and be exercised without the other leg to protect you.  This can lead to massive, life ruining losses.  This is not an exaggeration, google this and be scared.  It happened to a fair number of people with TSLA.**
* Spreads are neat because they manipulate how delta and theta act.  It caps your gains and losses, but you can profit with less stock movement.  Try several spreads on a P/L calculator to see for yourself.  I'm Theta Gang, so I like selling credit spreads sometimes since I profit from neutral movement and theta... sweet sweet theta.
* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider ""doubling down"".  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't recommend shorting shares.

&#x200B;

\-**Intermediate / Advanced Strategies (work in progress)-**

**Iron Condor and Iron Butterflies**

* Iron condor and Iron butterflies.  These strategies profit from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  They benefit from theta decay.  If your stock is range bound, these may be a good choice.  The condor can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wide for a much greater chance of success with low payout.  These are both 4 ""legged"" trades, so you will have 4 trading fees to enter or exit the trade.  A lower cost or zero cost broker shines here.  Condors and butterflies have ""wings"" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.
* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is a condor looks more like a strangle while a butterfly looks like a straddle.

**LEAPs**

* LEAP Options are options that are long term with many DTE, often over a year until expiration.  LEAP calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPs (or any ""longer term"" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)

**PMCC / PMCP**

* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call or poor man's covered puts.  They are diagonal options often used with purchased LEAPs.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting ""blown by"" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.
* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.
* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basic until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I MEME stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had \~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAP has.
* TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAP value.  I look at them more like a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.

Disclaimer/bio: I'm just a guy who trades (mainly options) part-time for financial gain and fun.  I've been pretty successful trading options, especially with theta (selling) strategies.  I got heavily involved with options again in September 2020 after a long hiatus.

Enjoy!

[**article link**](https://medium.com/@ProjectTheta/how-to-use-the-options-wheel-strategy-5013c9938f4b)

For those who are delving into the world of options, you may have heard about a **strategy** called the **Options Wheel.** The wheel is a great strategy for generating semi-**passive income** with a **lower risk** than many other strategies. What really shines in the options wheel is the **consistency** and **scalability** which can both benefit small and large accounts alike.

## Account Size

When trading options, always remember that the market will always be a game of chance. No matter how much time you put into research, the market will always remain unpredictable, and therefore it is important to **only start with what you are willing to lose**. Make a wise financial decision, and do not put all of your investing money into the wheel.

* A good balance of investing would be **60% in index funds, and the remaining 40% or less into the wheel strategy.**

>That being said, the amount of money required to start the wheel strategy is at least **$2500**

Having $2500 in your account ensures that you will be able to trade contracts on stocks or etfs which are above $20, which have significantly better risk-to-reward compared to penny stocks.

Now that we have finished with the formalities, lets get into turning the wheel.

# Step 1: Pick a Stock

The stock you pick for your wheel is extremely correlated to the performance of your account.

>*Only pick a stock that your are bullish on, or think will rise in the long termOnly pick a stock that you can afford. Your account value must be 100x greater than the price of the stock.*

**For example, some stocks that I like to use for the wheels strategy are:**

* TNA (an ETF)
* AMD
* INTC
* SPY (another ETF)

You get the picture. I believe that these stocks will grow in the long term, so they are fair game for the wheel strategy

* Assuming that SPY trades for $300, I will need 30k freed up in my account to run the wheel on it.

OK, now it is your turn to pick a stock or etf. Got it? Great, lets move on!

# Step 2: Sell a Cash Covered Put

Getting into the wording for all strategies can get confusing, so lets break it down into digestible chunks.

**Cash Secured** = We have the money to buy the shares if assigned**Selling a Put** = We write a contract that someone else buys. When they buy the contract, we agree to buy 100 shares of a stock that we choose, in the case that the stock falls under a strike price that we determine. In return, the buyer of the contract pays us a “premium”, which is just money in return for the contract.**Contract** = A contract that is either bought or sold. **each contract references to 100 Shares** <

Here is an example of a put that we sold — SPY 7/2 $290 Put 1.50p

In this put we agree to buy 100 shares of SPY if SPY drops down below $290. Because our price of SPY right now is $300, our contract will need $30,000 of collateral, because the contract references 100 shares. The person who buys our put has until 7/2 for their contract, and after that, if it has not dropped below $290, then it will expire worthless and we can go into another put.

## But Here is where the magic happens:

The person who bought our put paid us a premium, which in the above example is $1.50. In reality, that is $150 because our contract is for 100 shares. If the contract expires worthless, then we can keep the $150 as pure profit, and **this is where we make our money**.

Theoretically, we can make this money forever, by repeating these steps of selling a contract, expiring worthless, keeping premium, and selling another one.

However, if we want to make the most money, we have to find a good balance between premium and strike price

It is up to your risk tolerance to choose when you want to increase your premium or lower your strike price. Generally:

>A lower strike price will result in lower risk, but lower premium.A higher strike price will result in higher risk, but higher premium.

It is up to you to find that boundary, but generally, if you want an option to be worth your time, **your premium should be at least 1% of the stocks price.** Taking premiums lower is considered a waste of time, and will not generate significant profits. Finding your tolerance is important.

# Step 3: Repeat until assigned

Did the put that you sold expire worthless? Great job, you just netted **all the premium** from that contract as **profits**. But what next?Although not as of an exciting answer, just sell another put, maybe **upping your strike price, or lowering** depending on how you felt about the last one. Continue to do this until the contract that you sold expires in the money, or the price of the stock finally reaches below your strike price, and the person assigns.

# Step 4: Sell a Covered Call

The put that you sold just expired ITM (in the money)! The person who bought your contract has decided to assign, and you are forced to buy 100 shares of that stock.

The world is not over, but take that as a learning experience. Maybe you still made profits with the premium, but maybe you didn’t? Did you take too much of a risk? All of these are questions that you should ask yourself to evaluate how you can make your next play better. Anyways:

## You are stuck with 100 shares of a stock, what to do next?

This is where finding the right stock pays off. You are bullish on the stock, so holding it for a few weeks or months should be fine.

However, this is where the option wheel turns, and you capitalize on your 100 shares.

**Lets first break down what a covered call is:**

**Covered** = You have 100 shares of the company.**Selling a Call** = We write a contract that someone else buys. When they buy the contract, we agree to sell 100 shares of a stock that we own, in the case that the stock goes above a strike price that we determine. In return, the buyer of the contract pays us a “premium”, which is just money in return for the contract.**Contract** = A contract that is either bought or sold. **each contract references to 100 Shares** <

Here is an example of a covered call that we sold — SPY 7/22 $320 Call 1.85p

In this call we agree to sell 100 shares of SPY, by or before July 22, in the case that SPY’s price rises above $320 and the buyer of the call decided to exercise the contract. In return for this opportunity, we get paid $1.85 per share of SPY, which is actually $185, because the contract references 100 shares.

# Step 5: “Turn the Wheel!”

\*\*Now it is easy to see the power that the wheel strategy has!\*\*You can keep pocketing this premium every time one of your contracts expire worthless, and build this up into a large account! Congratulations, you just spun the options wheel strategy. Time to reset to Step 1, or just sell another put on the same stock if your outlook has not changed.

>*Thanks for reading this article, I hope it gave you insight to try or alter a new strategy. In conclusion, the wheel is a great way to generate passive income by selling options and collecting premium.*

EDIT: I was asked to put this into the article, as an explainer for some confusion:

 

1. Break even, max profit, and max loss values ONLY APPLY AT EXPIRATION. You can only gain the full premium, or  reach your max loss potential if you hold your contracts till expiration. Many people prefer to close out of contracts in a specified amount of time, like 1 month, or 30dte. 
2. Max profit comes with max risk and max holding time, so please, CLOSE YOUR POSITIONS BEFORE EXPIRATION.

678,Options Gamma for beginners,,587,kvfwb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kvfwb2/options_gamma_for_beginners/,1610410527.0,"Gamma is a measure of risk for options, and reflects the rate of change in delta for a $1 change in the underlying asset price. In other words, gamma represents what happens to delta as the underlying asset moves. Because it represents the change in delta as the underlying price changes, Gamma can be used to determine the magnitude of movement in an options price for a corresponding movement in the underlying.  Gamma is an essential part of derivatives pricing, and is very useful when it comes to more complicated strategies of risk management. 

Gamma is always positive for long options and negative for short options. This means all owners of options have positive gamma, regardless of being long or short the underlying asset. This also means that long option buyers benefit the most from gamma, as for every $1 movement in favor of the position, like a $1 increase for calls or a $1 decrease for puts, the opportunity for profit increases. This is because as gamma increases, so does delta, and meaning the profit per dollar increases as well. Furthermore, if the underlying asset moves against a position, like decreasing in price for calls or increasing in price for puts, gamma causes delta to decrease, causing lesser losses. 

Additionally, like theta and delta, gamma varies based on an options strike price and expiration. Gamma increases as an option approaches expiration, and decreases as an option becomes deeper in or out the money. The closer the strike price is to the underlying asset price, the higher the gamma, meaning at the money options have the highest gamma. Gamma is highest when the option is at the money, and decreases as the asset price moves away from the strike price. 

**How is Gamma used?**

Gammas mainly used to analyze delta, as it shows how delta will change with different movements in the underlying asset price. This, in turn, allows for risk mitigation, as an options price can be analyzed for a variety of different situations. 

In other words, by looking at  gamma, you can tell how much delta will change when the underlying asset’s price changes, which allows for a rough estimate of an options price for different movements in the underlying. 

Additionally, gamma can be used in more advanced methods of portfolio management. When delta hedging, gamma must be taken into account due to its impact on delta. As a quick reminder, delta hedging is a technique that minimizes delta so underlying price movement has little effect on a position. Delta neutral positions utilize this concept of delta hedging. Delta neutral positions have a delta close to 0 so underlying asset movement causes little change in the positions. This requires a neutral or near 0 gamma, which ensures the delta hedge remains effective even with more drastic price movement in the underlying asset. 

**An example with Gamma**

Let's look at an example of gamma and its relation to delta.  If a call option has a delta of 0.25, and a gamma of 0.05, a $1 change in the underlying asset price will result in delta changing by 0.05 (which is the gamma value). As always, this is assuming no other factors change. If the underlying asset’s  price increased by $1, the delta would go up to 0.30. Similarly, if the underlying asset price decreased by $1, the delta would go down to 0.20. As we discussed before, gamma is always a positive value. This can be confusing when it comes to options like long puts, so let's look at another example.  If a long put has a delta of -0.25 and a gamma of 0.05, then a $1 increase in underlying asset would cause the delta to go to -0.20, while a $1 decrease in underlying asset price would result in delta going to -0.3.

**The math behind Gamma**

We know delta to be the first derivative of the option value V with respect to the underlying asset price S.

Additionally, we know that gamma represents the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying asset price. This means that gamma is the second derivative of the option value with respect to the underlying asset, and the first derivative of delta with respect to the underlying asset price. 

**Wider applications of Gamma**

Gamma helps represent the concept of convexity, which states that as the price of an underlying asset changes, the price of a derivative (like an option), does not change linearly. Instead, its change depends on the second derivative. 

In mathematical terms, convexity represents the second derivative of the output price with respect to an input price, as does gamma in regard to derivative pricing. Convexity is most commonly used in reference to bond pricing and bond yields. 

Convexity = 1 / \[bond price x (1+y)2\]Σ

**Key Points:**

* Gamma represents the relationship between underlying asset price and delta. 
* Gamma varies depending on an options strike price and expiration, with at the money options and options closest to expiration having the highest gamma. 
* All long options have positive gamma, and all short options have negative gamma. 
* Gamma can be used to measure the magnitude of price movement for an option when the underlying asset changes, due to its relationship with delta.",options

Most readers here know that selling options is not quite as simple as the title, but a recent study published by the most excellent /u/spintwig really drives home why that is the case, and I wanted to highlight it.  The study contains tests of four different expiration strategies, but this post will pick on the 45DTE (Days Till Expiration), as that interval is the most popular thanks to TastyTrade.

A highly oversimplified explanation of Spintwig's test is that he backtested selling a put option against the SPX every day for two years.  You should absolutely read the entire thing to get all the details (will link in comments as automod typically removes posts with links in them as spam), but here are the parts to this discussion:

5D options are very far out of the money, so we'd expect small premiums, but a very high win rate.  And sure enough, when selling 5D (5 delta) options with 45DTE, the win rate was a whopping 95%.  Pretty good right??  I mean, with win rates like that, how can you lose??

Turns out you can lose pretty badly.  The Covid dip caused losses that completely destroyed the profitability of the entire strategy, even after the market came back.  **The 5% of the trades that were losers for the strategy not only wiped out every cent of gains from the 95% of the winners, but ended with the strategy down 12% overall, even after the market recovered.**

I will quote another very well informed contributor to these subs, u/imnotarobotyouare:  

""This is a successful options seller:""

""This is a losing options seller:""

The moral of the story is: Do not conflate win rate with edge.  As Spintwig demonstrates, you can play it safe by selling far Out-of-the-money options, win 95% of the time, and still lose a lot of money when the fat tail hits.

Thanks to Spintwig again for his excellent work and generosity in making it available for free.

EDIT: Some people seem to think this post is an endorsement of a completely mechanical “sell a SPX put each day” strategy. It’s not. It’s a demonstration of how even a very high win rate can still be swallowed by tail risk. That’s it.",options

683,PSA: Selling spreads can bankrupt you,,568,ga3e0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ga3e0r/psa_selling_spreads_can_bankrupt_you/,1588137242.0,"So I left a comment on another thread that got downvoted (initially) pretty bad when I tried to explain to someone that there's a very real potential to lose more than your theoretical max loss on a spread. It kind of scared me because alot of you might be trading spreads without truly understanding the mechanics involved, I say this as a person who once traded spreads without truly understanding what I was doing.

Another reason I made this thread is someone asked me if a NFLX earnings iron condor was ""risk free"" where the theoretical loss on the trade was +$9, due to the crazy IV richness in the calls before earnings. The answer to that question was a solid **no**. The reason why is because despite the greeks **every** options trade also comes with *assignment risk* and therefore *pin risk* as well.

Now you might want to hit that downvote button because repeat after me: the width of the strikes minus the credit blah blah blah. Yes, you're right when you sell a spread your theoretical max loss is the width of the strikes - the credit received a*ssuming both the long and short legs are exercised*.

However, there's a very real possibility depending on the width of your strikes that the long leg which is used for downside protection *could not* be ITM at expiration.

This means with most brokers that long leg will not be exercised at expiration unless you explicitly call risk management and let them know exactly what's going on. It depends on your broker but my broker will exercise the long in this scenario and my margin requirement is the width of the spreads.

How do I know this? Well I was almost assigned -177k worth of SPY shares in a 3k margin account that's where I got a very intimate understanding of what actually happens at expiration and settlement, so I'm trying to save you a few grey hairs k?

So that is in a sense ""assignment risk"", basically if you sold an option you have an obligation to produce the underlying if assigned, and you will be assigned at expiration if your option is ITM which is exactly at or above the strike.

Now ""pin risk"", so what happens if you get assigned? Well if your short is assigned you have to buy/sell the shares depending on your spread type.  If you sold the right to buy (call) you'd be short 177k worth of SPY, or sell (put)  you would have to buy 177k worth of shares of SPY. Sorry that your broker let you buy that many spreads with only 3k but woopsies shoulda known what you were doing before you made the trade. So what happens if this is way larger than your account size? Well the broker will immediately liquidate the position when the market opens on Monday. HOWEVER, there could be a significant gap in price over the weekend aka WWIII starts and the market tanks or a cure for corona is found and it gaps up to the moon. Depending on your now newly founded short/long position you could lose or gain significantly *significantly* more than what's in your brokerage account depending on what happens news wise over the weekend. Let me reiterate what significantly means, it means your broker could soon be owning your home and car because of that silly options spread you collected 100 bucks worth of credit on.

So long story short understand settlement, understand assignment, understand exactly how your position expires in all the cases ITM/OTM/between the strikes.

Here's a case study on assignment/pin risk with an iron condor: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ma1mXXFLGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ma1mXXFLGA)

Here's a guy who made 110k because of pin risk, it doesn't have to be all bad =) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/7w62s9/i\_somehow\_made\_110k\_this\_morning\_and\_im\_still\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/7w62s9/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not/)

&#x200B;

Tl;DR if you don't understand the mechanics behind assignment/settlement your loss could be much much larger than the quantity \* (width of spread - credit received) that is theoretical mass loss for a spread, in fact you could bankrupt yourself because you could be in an unlimited risk scenario on a highly leveraged stock position come monday after expiration. 

EDIT:To be very clear I wasn't ""almost assigned"" what I meant was I almost had a naked leveraged short position with no defined risk because I had a spread where the long was OTM but the short ITM i.e. price closed between the spread, a few cents above the short, and I couldnt be sure that someone was or wasnt going to exercise. I notified my broker and couldnt close the trade due to liquidity issues big boo boo. Since my long was OTM I notified my broker I would like to exercise it by explaining the spread and they walked me through it. So again to be super clear I WAS assigned the short ~177k worth of SPY but I also exercised the long explictly which allowed the spreads max loss to be the theortical loss: quantity * (width of spreads - credit). BUT if I didnt exercise my long Id be short -177k worth of SPY with no means of buying back the stock due to funding my account is only 3k in size and pin risk fwiw SPY was up a few percent that Monday as well which would have led to a larger loss.",options

I have TQQQ calls that expire this week and as we saw this afternoon, we dove hard.

At the moment I’m still holding onto them to salvage what I can but I’ve essentially hit about $400 left in my account. 

To put into context, I’ve been trading for almost a year now starting in September of 2019. I had plenty of success going up and even success on the way down after the covid crash in March. I started out with about 7k in September. My  TOS account peaked a little over 90k by April 2020. That’s when I slowly started losing hard

Fast forward to July and now I’m down to $400 and the past day and weekend I’ve been sick mentally. Like I actually want to feel like throwing up. I want to know how can I cope with these losses mentally. Although my initial principle is money I was willing to lose, the idea of Kinda getting out the game and the fact that I lost 99% of my portfolio is hard to swallow.

I’m not looking for sympathy because I knew the risk when I started. But I want to know how to mentally reset or ease myself.",options

686,Tesla Infinity Call Gamma Squeeze,,573,hk7nqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla_infinity_call_gamma_squeeze/,1593731187.0,"So I’ve had this hypothesis for a while now, and I’m almost certain it is what’s happening. Obviously I don’t have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an “infinity” call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. There’s been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so I’m not the only one to observe this. 

If you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, it’s similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason it’s notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, it’s call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than it’s put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection for big funds, but in Tesla, the majority of the option buying are OTM, upside calls. Next, Tesla at times can trade option deltas greater than share delta, which means options have a huge weight on price movement. In order to properly hedge options flow delta, a market maker would have to move the stock quite a bit. Furthermore, Tesla has a decent amount of shorts, despite being a successful stock (successful is defined as in the  price move). Finally, Tesla has a ton of retail interest and despite being a 1000+ dollar stock, it has a ton of retail call options buying too. These make for a lethal combination to basically squeeze it to “infinity” with little resistance. Anyways, this leads me to what I think what’s happening with Tesla. It’s actually quite simple to understand (more so if you understand terms like delta and gamma).

Here’s what happens. Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially, which moves it only a bit up > release some good news > force algos who trade news to buy stock > the original OTM calls are now closer to ATM > due to gamma, market makers have to buy more stock > after seeing the initial move, now retail is piling into calls too due to FOMO > shorts are buying back stock and buying calls to hedge too > causes market makers to now desperately buy more stock to hedge > cycle repeats > stock price goes to infinity.

Obviously this doesn’t work if you don’t have good news to release but Elon always does. This doesn’t work if no retail help you buy more calls, but everyone here will FOMO. Just go to wsb and check out the posts. This doesn’t work if there weren’t so many shorts in Tesla but there always will be who have to manage risk. This doesn’t work if some big find offloads Tesla shares as it goes up, but most are holding, including Elon. This doesn’t work if SPY tanks either due to beta, but SPY just goes up too on average.

And here’s the kicker. Once the calls expire, the stock price won’t drop since it erases all downside gamma. Then you repeat this every few months. This is how you can get a stock easily to infinity actually.

Now who’s the initial call buyers? No idea. It could even be Elon himself or someone related. This is what Porsche did with Volkswagen to cause the squeeze. Porsche loaded up on the calls first and then released their “news” (which was they locked up the float). The way Elon is taunting the shorts and SEC could mean he knows what’s happening too. The thing is, since all the initial person is doing is buying calls, he’s not doing anything bad. It’s not his fault that people then FOMO, market makes them rush to delta hedge, and shorts continue the call buying + share covering. The initial call buys may have started the chain, but the rest is set in motion by everyone else. 

Anyways, this means you actually can’t short Tesla. It’s just strictly -EV to do so. I bet you if you take a graph of SPY and Tesla side by side, on almost all days in which Tesla actually dropped, SPY probably dropped that day too. But there were days in which SPY probably barely went up but a Tesla shot up a ton (like today). So if you short Tesla, you would be strictly better off shorting SPY. Shorting Tesla also means paying a much higher IV in put options too and having more upside risk in short shares. The other way a short can win on Tesla is some bad news, but can you really time that greater than the times you keep buying puts?

So yea that’s basically the story of Tesla. This stock can literally go to 2000 with no fundamental change. As long as the call buying keeps happening, this stock will chug along to infinity.

Here’s my post a few months ago talking about this so I’ve been thinking about this for a while: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3g63c/tesla_options_activity/fnr3j1d/?context=3

I just wanted to give a more formal post. As I also mentioned, this is just a hypothesis, but there’s a ton of evidence supporting this, and it’s talked about my others too. You can google like TSLA convexity squeeze on YouTube and someone made a video about it. I’m just adding more details to provide color.

EDIT: This is just a hypothesis, so nothing set in stone. I can only infer things from the data. My tldr is if you are thinking about shorting Tesla, it's probably not a good relative short vs another name or vs SPY/IWM. I would not recommend buying puts, selling naked calls, or outright shorting stock. That doesn't mean you can't win shorting Tesla, but your EV on the return is probably not as high as other shorts over the Long Run. You need to time it incredibly well, and it's very hard to do. For example, during a SPY selloff, Tesla can drop a lot, but can you time the next SPY selloff? You are also paying a ridiculous IV for the puts, much higher than other names. If you do want to short and really have this urge to do so, pick a specific known event like say the earnings later this month and short it then. For the record, I'm not long Tesla (I am long other big tech though), but I'm merely trying to explain a hypothesis. Also saying ""don't buy puts"" is not the same as saying ""buy calls"", so keep they in mind. I'm not advocating to just keep buying calls either with the high IV. But saying ""don't buy puts"" or ""don't short naked calls""  is a ""trade"" in itself since saving money means you can use that on other trades.

EDIT: I’m gonna add one more edit because of the last comment. This dude on Twitter literally copy and pasted my original post.

This week I closed up roughly $1,250 which was about 1.5% of my buying power. The market indices were -1% this week, so I out-performed them (again).

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**CRM:** My CRM put will be assigned at roughly down 3% from my cost basis. I will sell a covered call after the open tomorrow expiring, this week or next depending on premiums and also what the shares open at. 

**DKNG:** Up 40% here, looking on a continuation of the trend to close around 60-70%. Earning $25 on theta per day anyways.

**FROG:** This position is completely flat. I still like the entry so will hold and keep an eye out to see what happens.

**PLTR:** up 15% on the puts I sold. Highly volatile stock with 10% intraday swings. With the government contracts they just signed I think there will be continued upside here. I'm HODLing until I can get 70-80% profit then I'll close to free up some buying power.

**RKT:** Up 50%, this is one green day from being 60-70% profit and then I will close. **Here's the thing:** what happens if RKT begins to go down closer to my strike? As long as it goes down slowly, both delta and theta will increase. So each day that passes when it gets closer to my strike price I will start to gain more value with theta. Every day that passes my contract gets more exposure to delta as well, so any bounce to the upside will put me in a good spot to close it out. Once the stock price starts to rise too far from my strike and I've gained 60-70% profit, the theta and delta values both drop leaving me to gain only a few dollars per day. Right now my contracts give me $14 per day in theta. If RKT opens green tomorrow my position will hit my 60-70% target and daily gain from theta will be $2-3, so why hold it when I'm not earning anything?

**TDOC:** Up 55%. This position was slightly red last week on the dip. Similar to PLTR I have faith in the fundamentals on this stock. Dips will be bought and $190 is a good floor.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play. 

**HYLN - Hyliion ($17)**

https://preview.redd.it/h19e85dwd1561.png?width=2042&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf13ca65f6a6ff08f3e84211ea1ff5c81365936

HYLN, formerly SHLL ticker that merge'd via SPAC. This ticker has been on my radar for a few weeks now, but I never quite pulled the trigger. I would have thought a base would form around the $21 level, but here at $17 I think it is prime for a reversal. I will be looking at selling the $15 strike put for January to give myself a bit more time. IV still very high in this name.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $15 strike put sold for $1.40 or $140 premium. Return: \~10%

&#x200B;

**NIO - Nio Inc ($41)**

https://preview.redd.it/lii3faeyd1561.png?width=2050&format=png&auto=webp&s=b068d41a0410781feb03f92225c82a138e1c41b3

NIO is down roughly 25% from the highs. For me, $40 could be a good place to form a base and sell some puts 1 or 2 strikes below. News of China required more strict financial audits has hurt a lot of Chinese stocks. IMO companies like BABA, NIO, JD are all legit and I don't see them getting de-listed due to above reasons. The lines I drew on this chart is actually from last week and the stocks seems to be flirting with my support line at the lower end of the channel/trend. A hold here would be bullish to see a reversal back to the upside.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $38 strike put sold for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: \~10%

&#x200B;

**U - Unity ($150)**

https://preview.redd.it/hg8pqdfzd1561.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c522c4070ce46e1d560c8272e9754e4ddc31b42

Unity IPO'd earlier this fall. It's been on a non-stop trek upward since and hasn't consolidated much along the way. The 10% drop last week gives a better entry point for the continuation in trend. If the price breaks below $138 or so, we could see more downside to lower $130's for consolidation. January puts offering very nice premiums on this solid company.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $140 strike put sold for $13.50 or $1,350 premium. Return: \~9%

2. Shares and covered calls to collect premium from high IV.

&#x200B;

**OSTK - Overstock ($55)**

https://preview.redd.it/skg3agx2e1561.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=7782afcc9d188247fb3933b0c121a5271677b7ef

Overstock was a 12-bagger from June to September and then the massive blow-off-top happened. The stock has been in the range of $55-70 since then, but looks to be consolidating recently. This was on my ""watchlist"" last week, but I saw better opportunities to be played. The stock is currently nearing the bottom of the trend and touching support, $53-55 looks like a good entry point for me with selling the $50 put.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $50 strike put sold for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: \~7.5%

2. Shares with a stop-loss around $40 and a target to take profit around $75.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WKHS - Workhorse ($22)**

https://preview.redd.it/r3vus004e1561.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d10ac3c733bddbcf87b98a6df8fb04f11c3e23ae

WKHS had a big gap-down recently and is trading at the very bottom of the upward trend. It's got support one dollar below current levels and could be primed for a reversal back up. IV super high on this one as well.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $19 strike put sold for $1.75 or $175 premium. Return: 9%

2. Shares with a stop-loss at $19 and profit taking target around $25. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CODX ($10)**

https://preview.redd.it/qzrf91e5e1561.png?width=2042&format=png&auto=webp&s=7952b795319155e7228af560f29cdb8dcbf105b1

Lastly we have CODX. The stock has taken an absolutely massive beating dropping from $31 in September to it's current price of $10. A 66% decline in just 3 months. Looking at chart, in my opinion, the selling looks to be coming close to an end. I think it will form a base around $10 or possibly $8 if it falls through the $10 support level. This is somewhat of a high-risk play, but premiums are nice and I am looking for a bounce.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $9 strike put sold for $1.05 or $105 premium. Return: \~12%

2. Shares here could be a less risky play if you don't like volatility. I could see a bounce here back to $15 in the next 2-3 months if things go well for the stock.",options

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week and my buying power currently sitting at about half my account. Tickers with positions still open: **CODX, FROG, NIO, PLTR, TDOC, U, WKHS**. Most are sitting at 40% profit already and I'll be looking to close around 60-70% if we get a good pop. Let's see.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**OSTK ($62)**

https://preview.redd.it/3uy1c2zy9f661.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=facc4eb3f7040ef5f76b54563ebb2a6cf5a81c35

I'm going to bring OSTK back this week after the red day it had on Friday. It's still near the lower end of the channel (consolidating) and I can see this getting a bounce back into the $70 zone. Support will be in the $57-58 zone if it continues to drop further.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $55 put for $3.25 or $325 premium. Return: 6%

2. Buy the dip on some shares and take some off the table as it gets close to $70.

&#x200B;

**PLTR ($26)**

https://preview.redd.it/d7ubjbmz9f661.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf39b4dafe9ae121ea5645e8a2e59ec7019789dc

Implied Volatility on PLTR has been giving absolutely juicy premiums, however, it seems like it's starting to go down after its been in the $25 range the last several weeks. I'd like to see this stay above $25 next week and then potentially break-out back above $30. It's currently at the bottom of the channel, if it breaks maybe we'll see back down to $22 support. I like this ticker and will be buying the dip when I can or if I get assigned.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $24 put for $1.75 or $175 premium. Return: 7.3%

2. Shares are also good here, but I prefer to collect on the high IV while I still can.

&#x200B;

**SPCE ($24)**

https://preview.redd.it/ueqni680af661.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32ac8f87fa9f00668c938e912942772d9a690ba

SPCE had to re-schedule their launch last week and the stock price seemed to be relying on a successful trip. It's had some pretty big gap downs last week and is sitting at -30% in the last 7 days. With the volatility the stock has experienced, the trend is difficult to identify. However, I think $22 level will provide good support and some buyers. If not we may re-visit $18 again like it did back in November. I'll be testing my luck on this one selling some puts.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $22 put for $1.37 or $137 premium. Return: 6.2%

2. Shares might be a good entry looking for a bounce play. Like I said, the positions I am entering will be expecting the stock to stay above $22 and perhaps get back into the $25 range.

&#x200B;

**PSTH ($25)**

https://preview.redd.it/8gewi7z0af661.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c572d5a71c00cd22d8f157c7befd914c876464

PSTH had a good run-up recently. Many investors are expecting some big news coming from Bill Ackman. Many rumors floating around for different acquisitions, but nobody really knows what's happening. In my opinion as more time goes by then we will be getting closer to a merger. With more exposure the stock has been getting I think the speculation on which acquisition alone will keep the stock above $25. Implied Volatility also not bad here. I'm going to sell an ATM put on this one. Risk level is a little higher, but any early assignment would actually do me a favor and make my trade more profitable.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 6%. Break-even stock price here is $23.50, so I only need the stock to stay above that in 4 weeks.

2. Might also pick up some shares if the stock dips some more.

&#x200B;

**BIG ($45)**

https://preview.redd.it/0sezreg1af661.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba56c4f2b6fef5356bdc718c0e09ec38b2edab93

This name is somewhat unusual and isn't mentioned very much. I've been keeping my eye on it and look at this consolidation it's had over the last 3-4 months. It's been within a 10% range the entire time, kind of cool to see. It's had a big gap down and a massive red candle Friday. I want to see some of the price action Monday or Tuesday, but in my opinion, the $43-44 level could provide a good bounce.

**Positions On Watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $42.50 put for $1.85 or $185 premium. Return: 4.5%. Break-even stock price is $40.65 here.

2. IV is fairly moderate here and selling puts wouldn't be the most efficient. I might buy some shares instead and look to start taking profits at the $50 level.",options

Recently I’ve been focusing on how to tell if insiders in a company anticipate a potential upside or downside to their company. As the great Peter Lynch once said: “insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.” I couldn’t find a data source that compiled all the buying and selling data for companies, so I made one. I created a Python script that picks up Insider Trading transactions for all publicly listed companies. I just completed it so I haven’t had time to test out the impact insider trades have on the stock price, but I thought you guys might think it was a cool source of data. Let me know what you think!

700,The Wheel (aka Triple Income) Strategy Explained,,528,a36k4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/,1543968236.0,"EDIT:  Hello All, the response to this post has been amazing, thanks for the many who have contributed or inquired.  Wanted to add a few things up front that seem to be causing confusion.

1) The goal of this strategy is to collect the premium, NOT be assigned stock!  While being ready and able to take the stock is part of the plan, being assigned is always to be avoided.  If you sold a CSP 1 time and were assigned, you are either doing something wrong or are terribly unlucky by picking a stock that tanked.

CSPs should be sold over and over or rolled for a credit, to avoid assignment.  You should be collecting 4 to 5 or more premiums worth several dollars before getting assigned.  Some who have contacted me sold a CSP and just waited to be assigned, this is not the strategy.

If you are getting assigned more than a couple times a year you may want to look at the stocks you are trading and how well you are managing your position.  Getting assigned the stock should be a very rare occurrence!

2) As you select the stock and sell the CSP expect to get assigned.  Be sure it is a low cost enough stock so that you can handle the stock and still make other trades.  If you're trading a $150 stock, be aware you could have $15K tied up for a while and be prepared to do that.

3) Going along with #2 I trade small and use lower cost stocks.  The premiums are not as juicy and the attraction of a TSLA or AMZN is hard to resist, but you are better selling 1 contract at a time for 10 positions than 10 contracts in one position and have to take 1000 shares.  

It is always good account management to not trade more than about 5% of your account in any one stock to avoid news or movement from the stock from blowing up your account.  It is also a good idea to keep 50% of your buying power available for safety and to take advantage of opportunities.  

4) There have been negative nellies telling me this won't work and being critical.  Note that this is not my strategy and I don't make any money from it being used or not.  My time was spent in an effort to show one method options can more safely be traded, so if you have had a bad experience or think there are better ways, then feel free to post them!  

5) Lastly, I have not done any research on this vs buying and holding stock.  I've traded for more than 20 years with most of that time focused on stocks, and I did well!  

Where I see the main differences are that options give leverage so I can collect premium from more stocks than just buying a couple, so this spreads out my risk.  Also, I very much like the shorter time frame as I can move on to other stocks should one drop or run up.  If done well you may only get assigned a couple times a year and often be out of the stock in a couple weeks.

OK, I think you will see this is not sexy or exciting trading, it is boring and you make $50 per position in many cases, but they add up.  For those looking at huge returns and the excitement of major risk, this is not for you.  If you want a more reliable way to trade options then this may be good to check out.  

&#x200B;

Original Post:

I've been asked and have explained The Wheel strategy many times, so thought it may be a good idea to write it down all in one place for posterity!

&#x200B;

This is the options strategy I use most often and IMHO it is about as safe and reliable as options trading gets.  You will NOT get fantastic returns and it is quite boring and slow, but with the proper stock and patience, it can result in reliable profits and income.  A 10% to 20%+ return is not difficult depending on a few factors, mostly based on stock selection, experience managing short puts and calls, plus the trader's patience.

&#x200B;

The Wheel (sometimes called the Triple Income Strategy) is a strategy where a trader sells cash secured Puts to collect premiums on a stock or stocks they wouldn't mind owning long term.  If the options expire or closed for a profit without being assigned, the premiums are all profit.  The goal is to set up trades and avoid being assigned, but it is understood that if the put is assigned the account will buy and hold the stock.  Through the collection of premium, the initial cost basis of the stock can often be lower than the strike price paid.  

&#x200B;

The next step of The Wheel is to sell covered calls on the stock.  It is highly preferable to sell a call with a strike higher than the stock's cost basis, but this is not always possible.  This is repeated over and over to collect even more premiums that continue to lower the stocks cost basis, and along with any rising stock price movement, works back to break-even or a profit.

&#x200B;

At some point the call is exercised and the stock called away, or you can simply sell the stock, but when you add up all the premiums collected from selling the puts and calls, plus it is desired and common to end up selling the stock for a profit, this results in the Triple Income.  If the stock pays a dividend while you own it then you can collect that as well (Quadruple income!).

&#x200B;

Below is a graphic showing the simple way to track the Credits and Debits to keep track of the overall position.

&#x200B;

Step #1: Stock Selection - Most traders who have had a bad experience with the wheel have chosen the wrong stock.  The stock(s) you chose must be a good candidate and one you don't mind owning for some length of time, as it is possible you could own it for months.

&#x200B;

Use your own criteria that fits your account, but this is what I use:

* Profitable company that has solid cash flow
* Bullish, or Very Bullish, analyst ratings
* Priced around $10 to $50 so that I can afford to take the assignment if needed and I stay away from sub-$10 stocks as a rule
* A stable chart without wild gyrations (especially those caused by CEO tweets!)
* A nice dividend is always a good thing, both that you may collect it if assigned the stock but also that dividend stocks tend to more stable and predictable

&#x200B;

Use your own fundamental analysis criteria to create a watchlist of 10 or so stocks that you can trade.  If you find some lower priced ETFs, or have a larger account for the more expensive ones, then these can be included and make good candidates due to their normally steady movement, no ERs, and no CEO tweets.  I look at my watchlist every few weeks and change it accordingly.

&#x200B;

Step #2: Sell Puts - Cash Secured Puts (CSPs) indicates you have the cash/margin to buy the stock if it is assigned.  Be aware of any upcoming ER or other events that could cause a spike or movement in the stock, it is best to close or have the Put expire prior to the event, in effect skipping it and then continue selling CSPs afterward if the stock still meets the criteria.

&#x200B;

Sell a Put on the selected stock: Below is a suggested model, but up to the individual trader:

* 30 to 45 DTE offers a good premium as the time decay curve starts to accelerate
* 70% Prob OTM or higher (\~.30 Delta)
* Number of contracts is based on account size able to handle an assignment
* The Put can be closed and re-opened, or rolled, at 50% profit if there is plenty of time left, although you can let it expire or close and re-open at any point
* Enter the Credits received, and any Debits paid to close or roll, on the Tracking P&L file
* Roll for a credit if the Put is challenged when possible, and provided a credit can be made it can be rolled as long as needed which can also be used to track the stock's movement by changing the strike price
* If a credit cannot be made then it is best to take assignment of the stock

&#x200B;

The CSPs should be able to be sold over and over to collect as much premium as possible, and often never be assigned.  If there is a fundamental change in the stock, close your position for an overall net profit and then move on to review and/or move on to another stock.

&#x200B;

If assigned then Sell Covered Calls as shown in Step #3.

&#x200B;

Step #3: Sell Covered Calls - Using the tracking file determine the net stock cost which is often already below where the stock is.  As selling puts is usually the most profitable, some traders just sell the stock and move on to selling more CSPs, or sell a very high-value ITM Call that is sure to be called away and adds to the profit.

&#x200B;

If your net stock cost is above the current market price and you keep the stock, then the goal is to sell CC premium to continue adding to the Credits and lowering the net stock cost below where the stock is trading before it gets called away.

&#x200B;

Sell CCs, again here is a suggested process:

* Sell a Call above the net stock cost whenever possible, however, at times you may need to trade the strike below to get some good premium.  Note that I will settle for a lower premium to be farther out to avoid the risk of early assignment and give the stock a chance to stabilize and possibly start to recover.
* Same as CSPs: 30 to 45 DTE, 70% Prob OTM or higher
* Close and re-open, or roll, at 50% profit
* Roll for a credit when possible, or allow exercise and the stock to be called away if a credit is not possible (especially if the strike is above the net stock cost)
* Track Credits and Debits, plus any Dividends captured, on the tracking file
* Continue this until the net stock cost is below the strike price at which time the stock can be left to be called away (some note that it cost less in fees to close the option and just sell the stock which accomplishes the same thing)

&#x200B;

Step #4: Review and go back to Step #1 - While the tracking file makes it easy to see the P&L, review the trade to verify the numbers and then look for the next, or same, stock to sell CSPs in Step #1.

&#x200B;

As they say, rinse and repeat.

&#x200B;

Risks and Possible Problems:  The single biggest issue for this strategy is the stock price drops significantly, but this is no more risk than just owning the stock outright.

Stock Drops:  The reason to make these trades on a stock you wouldn't mind owning is because of this risk, and if a good stock is selected then this should be a very rare occurrence plus not a major issue.

* The price of the stock may drop well below the CSP strike and rolling for a credit will not be possible causing assignment.
* If CSPs were sold over and over the net stock cost may be much lower mitigating this drop in price.
* Management is to sell CCs over and over to allow time for the stock to recover, this can take time but when added to the CSP premiums collected the position can get ""healthy"" faster than you may think, however, this does take a lot of patience!
* There may be rare occasions when a stock is no longer viable (Enron?) and the position needs to be closed for a loss, again this shows the critical importance of stock selection.

Stock Rises: Many see this as a problem, but I personally do not as if the CC strike is above your net stock cost then the position profits, but just not as much.

* The stock is assigned and you sell CCs only to have the stock run well past your strike price.
* In most cases closing the CC and selling the stock outright can cause a bigger loss than just letting the stock be called at the strike price.
* It is, in this case, you may lament the profits that were ""lost"" by having the CC, but provided the above is done properly the position will still profit.

Impatience: By far this causes the most losses from this strategy!

* First, if you can't roll for a credit let the CSP play out!  If you close the CSP early it will cause a major loss.
* If you get assigned the stock and sell CCs, do not try to ""save"" the stock through buying it back at an inflated price!  If you can't roll for a credit then let the stock be called away and sell more CSPs to start the process over again provided the stock is still a viable candidate.
* Recognize it may take months selling CCs to build the premium up to a point where the net stock cost is less than the current stock price, but it will happen eventually if you can keep the CC from being exercised early.

&#x200B;

A Tracking P&L File graphic is included and shows Credits and Debits to know where the position is at any given time.  Note the stock price can be entered as a Credit to show where the position is at any given time.  This is simple to create and use.

Hopefully, this is a thorough and detailed trading plan, but let me know of any questions, typos or improvements you may have!  -Scot

701,Options Book List: Review of all books that helped me prepare for a career in trading,,525,8qfs14,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options_book_list_review_of_all_books_that_helped/,1528774470.0,"# Hey all,

A comprehensive options/trading book list has been requested on this subreddit several times. I've been reading about options and trading since freshman year of college (2012), and these books helped me prepare for a career in options trading. Over the past two years, I've been working at a Chicago\-based options market making firm, and spent time on the modeling team, S&P desk, and a trading automation team.

**Here are the books that have helped me the most over the past 6 years.**

# 

# Miscellaneous: [Finance, Trading, Markets]

* *Alpha Masters* by Maneet Ahuja **(9/10)**
   * Enjoyable book to read as as freshman with an interest in finance but no idea about the different types of trading roles / strategies out there. The author interviews some of the most famous hedge fund managers (Ray Dalio, David Tepper, John Paulson) book covers different hedge fund managers and discusses strategies from macro, distressed debt, swaps, equities, short sellers, options, shareholder activism, and a little financial engineering.
* *Fooling Some of the People All of the Time* by David Einhorn **(8/10)**
   * Listened to this on audible when walking to class. This is the story David Einhorn tells about his fight with Allied Capital, his own ""big short."" Covers fraud accounting & general investing. Useful for any business student.
* *Hedge Fund Market Wizards* by Jack Schwager **(7/10)**
   * Same format as Alpha Masters; interviews with top hedge fund managers, although Jack's series came first. I read this one after Alpha Masters and it honestly felt like it didn't live up to the hype.
* *Reminiscences of a Stock Operator* by Edwin LeFevre **(6/10)**
   * Biography of a stock trader in bucketshops during the '20s. I don't really remember a ton of valuable takeaways, it got kinda boring.
* *Dark Pools* by Scott Patterson **(8.5/10)**
   * Read this five years ago but I remember liking it a lot. History of automated trading and describes some of the strategies the first guys were making. Good story of exchanges, markets, and algorithmic trading from 90s to 2010. Although a lot of the strategies might be arb'ed out or outdated, I might actually pick this back up for some idea generation.
* *When Genius Failed* by Roger Lowenstein **(9/10)**
   * Practical trading book that tells the story of rise/demise of Long Term Capital Management. Another one useful for most undergrads, good on audiobook, and entertaining. Lessons applicable to options trading (realized vars, correlations, etc.)
* *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by Marcos Lopez de Prado **(9/10)**
   * MLdP is a quant trading genius and this is a pretty useful book for anyone with ML background. I like the chapter on cross validation, strategy risk, and anything backtest related.
* *Algorithmic Trading* by Ernie Chan **(8/10)**
   * Ernie Chan has 3 books out w/ quant strategies and MATLAB code. Good resource for statistical arbitrage and mean\-reversion strategies, but I didn't read all of his stuff.

# Beginner Options: [Spreads, Greeks]

* *Option Volatility and Pricing* by Sheldon Natenberg **(8/10)**
   * Extra point because its always referred to as the ""bible"" of option trading. It's very straightforward, covers forward pricing, dividends, spreads, volatility skew, implied distributions. Ch 24 is especially important, but otherwise very dry.
* *Option Trader's Hedge Fund: A Business Framework for Trading Equity and Index Options* by Mark Sebastian **(8/10)**
   * This was my first options book. Practical trades, discusses some vol modeling, hedging/defending, stories from an early\-2000s\-ex\-market\-maker. While I'm really opposed to any book or content that pushes trading in *one way*, this book approaches options trading from an ""insurance"" mindset, calling it the ""One Man Insurance Company."" I vaguely remember most trades being net short premium, but there were a few relative vol trades. He ""coaches"" options traders, so he has quite a few examples and describes common pitfalls.
* *Options Volatility Trading* by Adam Warner **(8/10)**
   * Good primer on trading VIX options and conceptualizing volatility trading. I especially remember his analogy to weather, VIX futures, and why modeling is important for VX. Adam Warner also has a good book on Volatility ETFs. If you've ever wondered why relationships between SPX and VIX diverged, or why VIX went up but your VIX calls didn't, read this book.

# Intermediate Options: [Vol Trading]

* *Option Gamma Trading E\-Book Series* by Simon Gleadall **(9/10)**
   * Helps conceptualize gamma and its role in exposure to realized volatility, scalping, profitability, and time. If you're looking for a quick read, check it out.
* *Trading Options as a Professional* by James Bittman **(9/10)**
   * Bittman is another ex\-market maker from the floor, and I think he now works at Cboe in Education. While his book encompasses what MM were doing \~15 years ago, a lot of the concepts are still important, like pricing synthetics, revcons, dividends, boxes, flying off options, and managing bids/offers.
* *Trading Volatility* by Colin Bennett **(9/10)**
   * One of the absolute best resources for institutional option trading, skew, correlation, and term structure trading.
* *Volatility Trading* by Euan Sinclair **(8/10)**
   * Ignore the volatility forecasting sections, but pay closer attention to psychological biases, and money management/kelly.
* *Exploiting Earnings Volatility* by Brian Johnson **(7/10)**
   * The title is a little cheesy, and it comes with some excel sheets that, if you learn them, could help a good amount with trading earnings. It's not the best system cause it's missing some of the nuances of event pricing, but it teaches a really good amount about the vol surface, how it changes around earnings, and how vol should move as we approach the event. Good overall, and I don't think any other book teaches event pricing. Never took the time to learn his excel sheet, though, but it can spur some good trade ideas.
* *Dynamic Hedging* by Nassim Taleb **(9/10)**
   * Very important book, and still a reference to this day. Pay special attention to chapters on vol surface, shadow greeks, alpha, and arbitrage.

# Advanced Options: [Vol Surface, Modeling]

These books are all under the same umbrella of how to model arbitrage\-free volatility surfaces, local volatility, SVI, skew, correlation, and term structure dynamics. Not useful for retail.

* *Volatility Smile* by Emanuel Derman **(9/10)**
* *Volatility Surface* by Jim Gatheral **(9/10)**
* *Lectures on the Smile* by Derman **(8/10)**
* *Financial Mathematics of Market Liquidity* by Gueant **(7/10)**

First off, Happy New Year! It's now 2021! This means there are a lot of people that are wanting to start fresh with new goals, resolutions and getting into new hobbies or interests. If you want to start 2021 with the goal of being financially responsible, want to see if trading in the stock market is your thing, or if you've been doing it and you're just trying to find your way around this crazy mess, then read on!

&#x200B;

**1. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A MENTOR**

\- Be cautious of who you're learning from or where you're putting your trust and money. There are many people that charge outrageous amounts of money to teach you things that you can learn on your own for free. They glamorize this rich lifestyle that they supposedly built from trading or promise you an accelerated path to profit, and now they want to help you do the same. Think about it, if these people were so successful, then why do they need to shove their courses down your throat? I, and a lot of other people, are almost entirely self-taught through reading books, websites and watching YouTube videos. I believe myself to be a self-sufficient trader now. At least for my personal goals, trading style, and expectations. You can learn on your own too, for free 99.

&#x200B;

**2. ""I NEVER LOSE. I EITHER WIN, OR I LEARN""**

\- This journey you're about to start...It's hard. It really is. You're going to encounter many obstacles and experience many pitfalls. You're also going to learn many hard lessons along the way regarding patience, mistakes, risk, and discipline to name a few. You're going to lose money. You're going to feel defeated. You're going to feel like giving up. It's natural. It's human-nature. We've all gone through it. Wanting to give up and quit is especially the case when you lose your hard-earned money. Don't lose hope or give up. Ask anyone how much they lost or how long it took them before they started making money consistently. If they say $0 or not even a few months, they're lying out of their ass. If you win, great! If you lose, learn why you lost. Dig deeper into the reasons and circumstances that led to it. Arguably, you should be tracking your wins and logging that info as well so you can replicate it. I blew up my account twice (about $3500 total) and recovered it all twice (shit gets old quick btw). First from fomo'ing call options on NIO's very first run up when I didn't know about implied volatility (IV) and yolo'ing calls on Rocket's very first earnings because I didn't know that even if expectations are beat, the price direction is still 50/50. Did I feel like quitting? Of course! However, each time I lost big like that I dug into the why's and how's. Coincidentally, if you look at my post history, my very first post (and the most upvoted one) was teaching people how to play NIO's earnings the smarter/safer way. LOL.

&#x200B;

**3. TRADE WITH FAKE MONEY FIRST (OR DON'T)**

\- There's this thing called paper trading where you can try investing/trading without using your hard-earned money. Take advantage of it! I personally didn't and I somewhat regret it. I say somewhat because I believe I would've lost a lot less money than I did while learning. However, the stakes are much higher and I believe it forced me to learn faster. Losing your real money is a whole lot different than losing ""fake"" money and affects you much differently.  Use that information how you want to.

&#x200B;

**4. PLAN YOUR TRADE, TRADE YOUR PLAN**

\- This goes a long way. Whenever you're looking at a play. Have a plan to enter, have a plan for the duration you're in the trade, and have a plan to get out of it. Having a plan keeps you consistent. Consistency is the name of the game here. Can you ultimately make money more than you lose it? Having a plan also keeps you out of trouble. For example, one of the biggest pitfalls of trading is trading emotionally. It's almost like when poker players or video gamers ""tilt"". They get nervous, mad, frustrated, scared, pressured, etc and it interferes with their decision-making and thought process. Having a simple plan and following basic rules like not using money you need for bills, or putting all of your money in one trade drastically reduces the risk of getting emotional.

&#x200B;

**5. SET GOALS. REALISTIC ONES**

\- Just like having a plan, setting goals goes a long way. This also helps with staying consistent and building confidence. I have a few friends whose goal is 5-10% of profit each day. Once they make that goal, they're done for the day. Doesn't matter if they cut out too early and it keeps running. They've reached their goal and are fine with that. They do it all over again the next day.

&#x200B;

**6. FIND YOUR IDEAL TRADING STYLE**

\- Day/Scalp traders, swing traders, momentum traders, breakout traders, the list goes on. Each type of trader has their own little nuances and things to pay attention to. For example, a swing trader doesn't really care about intraday price movements as opposed to how much a day trader cares. Or a technical trader doesn't really care about the fundamentals of the company they're trading as opposed to a fundamental trader. Find what style suits your personality and/or what style fits your level of commitment. For example, day trading requires monitoring the market or price action which isn't suitable for someone who works a 9-5 job with meetings all day.

&#x200B;

**7. WELCOME TO THE RABBITHOLE!**

\- Trading requires a certain level of dedication, discipline, and effort to get good at. Do people over in the wallstreetbets sub win money with minimal effort? Yes, they do. But not all the time and is mostly based on luck, thus that ""strategy"" isn't sustainable. Learn as much as you can from as many (reputable) sources as possible. Try out what they're teaching, tweak it, fine tune it to how you trade. Even though you've been trading forever and might think you know something, someone else comes along that can do what you do a million times better, faster, and more efficiently. My main point is never stop learning. #StayLearningStayEarning is the motto of my YT channel because although I learned enough to be a self-sufficient trader, I'm still open-minded and make an effort to learn as much as I can. I don't know everything, I'm not perfect, but I definitely want to be better than I was yesterday.

&#x200B;

**8. WHAT GOES UP (ESPECIALLY IN A VERY SHORT TIME), MUST COME DOWN**

\- Don't get caught in the hype of a certain ticker, especially penny stocks. When people ask me what I think about x company and I look at the chart and see green candles for days going vertical or almost vertical, I tell them it's not worth my time and I personally don't want to trade it. Can you still trade things that run up crazy like that? Of course you can! I've stayed in trades that got me over 100% in profit, but stayed in it because it showed me it wasn't done running yet. However, that's a discussion for another day. But since you're a beginner, I'd strongly advise against it until you, at the very least, start to feel comfortable.

&#x200B;

That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'm sure that's enough to give you a good foundation. If you have any questions or need help with something, feel free to message or comment. If you did check my post history for that NIO post I referenced back in #2, you'll find that I'm very open to helping. I love helping people with what I know. If you have anything to add to the list that I forgot, by all means, comment them down below to help our new brothers and sisters.

Wishing you all a very healthy, happy, and profitable 2021!

711,Great Trade Opportunity in Oil Tankers?,,502,g682a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/g682a7/great_trade_opportunity_in_oil_tankers/,1587585139.0,"I’m sure no one here is a stranger to the wild ride oil has taken in the last week. To all you USO holders; my deepest sympathies. But opportunity always emerges out of the ruin. In this case, that opportunity is Oil Tankers (VLCC’s, Suezmax, LR2, etc.). I will try and keep this short as this could turn into page after page highlighting all the ways this trade is ripe for 10x (or more) returns.

Where to start, oil tankers have historically been a losing investment. The world has more of them than needed, and supply of oil is pretty balanced with demand, therefore rates for oil tankers stay pretty consistent, and companies show mediocre returns. Let me give you an example of the times we are currently experiencing. In 2019 (which was a very good year for tanker rates), VLCC daily spot rates, weather to transport or hold the crude, were around $25,000 per day. In 2020 thus far, those same day rates have averaged a whopping $103,000 per day. Last week the rates increased to $180,000 per day, and currently we are seeing rates in excess of $250,000 per day with no ceiling in sight.

The reason, as many of you have seen, is that the world has 100’s of millions of barrels of excess oil and no place to put it (India, Cushing OK and China are all nearing 100% capacity). Which in commodity terms can be translated into what's called **CONTANGO.** Therefore you see occurrences like WTI futures trading at negative $30 per barrel. In a commodity traders eyes, or airline or refinery etc., they are seeing dollar signs. They are taking ownership of this oil and getting paid millions to do so. A typical VLCC holds 2 million barrels. If someone is paying you $30 a barrel to take their oil, as happened earlier this week, guess what, you just got paid 60 million to take 2 million barrels of oil. Then guess what you do? You load that oil on a tanker and wait 6 months for oil to recover and sell it at $20 per barrel, if not more. That means you just made 100 million dollars without putting up a dime for the oil, you just have to pay a tanker to hold it. Now paying $200,000 per day for a tanker doesn’t seem that bad for 180 days, those traders just made serious money off the trade. As you can see, paying rates of up to $350,000 per day is still a win when someone is paying you to take their oil. And guess what happens when all these tankers are being used to hold oil, the existing tankers used to transport crude rocket their rates as well.

How long will the oversupply last? We are nearing capacity all around the world for storage. The world is pumping an extra 30 millions barrels a day it doesn’t need. By mid may the world’s reserves will be maxed out. “But Opec+ is cutting” - Too little too late, they are cutting 10 MM per day starting in May. With new waves of Corona and countries preparing to lock down until late summer, the EIA and other agencies, still expect the glut to build by 10 million barrels per day. That means these tankers will be held up long term storing oil, and when the world finally starts to consume oil, we will have to make up 10 million barrels a day, which could take several years to balance. Keep in mind that the minute oil prices rise, producers will open the wells back up, and the reserves being stored will take longer to exhaust, therefore driving up tanker rates.

Here is the part that's hard to understand; these tanker stocks are still trading below YTD (Currently as of 4/22/2020):

STNG: -35%

EURN: -6%

FRO: -15%

TK: -26%

NAT: +6%

DHT: 1.5%

You might ask yourself, why did these tanker prices increase at the end of 2019? I’ll tell you, a regulation called IMO 2020, which basically means that tankers have to meet certain emission standards or be scrapped. Therefore, months before Corona paralyzed the world, tanker stock were already looking bullish because the fleet size was being reduced due to IMO 2020. Less tankers meet emission standards, less tanker supply, more tanker demand. As you can imagine, Corona and the oil war have added fuel to this fire.

Crunch some numbers and you will see that at the current rates, $200,000 spot price per day, these tanker companies will net more in 3 months than in the last 5 years combined. A typical tanker cost about $10,000 per day to operate, so over the last 5 years with averages rates of $20,000 per day, one boat will net just over 18 million. 90 days at $200,000 per day ($190,000 per day net) shows a net of 17 millions in 3 months. As you can see these tankers are in unparalleled times, capable of making revenues this year alone that match the total market cap of the company.

Sound too good to be true, go re-visit 2003-2008, the last time we had a serious oversupply and Contango, and look at what tanker stocks did during this time. This market is extremely bullish, not for the long term, but is going to be extremely profitable for the next 24 months. Profits would point to these stocks going up 3x, 5x, 10x, or more in value. Companies like EURN, NAT, and STNG have good tanker configurations, meaning the varying types of tankers, VLCC, Suezmac, LR2, ect., and have BEEN BUYING BACK STOCK AS WELL AS INCRESING DIVIDENDS, which is a pretty clear indicator of where the company's management thinks the prices are going.

Here are some good resources: [Curzio Research](https://www.curzioresearch.com/this-will-be-the-greatest-trade-in-decades/), [VLCC Rates](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3557384-vlcc-charter-rates-skyrocket-past-200k-per-day), [Bulls Coming](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3548409-vlcc-market-to-stay-supported-international-seaways-ceo-says)

tl;dr – The crude tanker industry is about to explode with tankers generating more profits in the next 90 days than they did in the last 5 years combined, and that's only the beginning. The last time Contango and oversupply like this happened was in the mid 2000’s, it generated returns of 5x to 10x up to 50x. At current prices, tankers are vastly undervalued. Earnings reports come out in early May when these shares will sky rocket.

Positions: Basket of stocks (FRO, EURN, STNG, DHT, TK, NAT). Being that earnings for all these companies comes out in early May, expect these stocks to go north at an extreme rate:

EURN $15c 5/15

TNP $5c 5/15

DHT $9c 5/15

NAT $5.50c 5/15

NAT $8c 5/15

STNG $35c 5/15

TK $5c 5/15

I was underwhelmed, so I suggest a counter-analysis.

**Debunking the previous ""analysis""**

Basically, the only arguments were that: the earnings per share and the revenue per share are low. Both of which are usually irrelevant for an early stage company with a high potential for growth.

The earning per share are completely useless for such a company:

* Amazon had very low profit, or had losses for a large part of their history (so P/E ratio was >500 for 3 years, with a quarter at 3,600 and 7 quarters at infinity P/E ratio, [source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio)). The average annual return on Amazon stock was +35% since then (1,000% total)
* Facebook had a P/E ratio of 1200 at their first quarter. Average annual return of +37% since then (933% total)
* Tesla never made a profit, so their P/E ratio has always been infinite. But average annual return of +49% since their IPO (3,700% total)
* Edit: I chose the most famous examples. But, because many commenters focused on those particular companies, I looked for random ones. Between tickers AAA and ACA, in the Russell 2000, I found Axon Enterprise, Ameris Bancorp, Asbury Automoative Group, ACADIA pharmaceuticals, and Axcelis Technologie. All traded with infinite P/E ratio, all of them were excellent buys at the time. P/E ratio doesn't mean anything by itself, especially for small and medium companies.

I'm no financial analyst, but I think I can do better than that youtube video.

The first thing to do is to look at their 10-K (annual report)   
[https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/09a01665-5f33-4007-8e90-de02219886aa](https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/09a01665-5f33-4007-8e90-de02219886aa)

A good analyst would probably read the whole thing. I just went to page 38 to read this:  


[Zoom financial statement](https://preview.redd.it/v7kbr2iqm7651.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f585e9b90c2aa915048f6569b2cb9e0028ea45)

Here, you can see that their YoY growth in revenue was +148% in 2017, +118% in 2018, +88% in 2019. So, if the pandemic had not happened I would have assumed a revenue growth of 60-70% in 2020. Which would mean a 1 billion revenue in 2020, without a pandemic. The ""practical investor"" video states ""suppose that Zoom does very well and their revenue for this year is 1 billion dollars"". So, their optimistic estimation with covid19 and everybody working from home and talking about Zoom is... my base expectation for the counter-factual ""no covid"".

**Why $68 was a fair share price in 2019**  
For a company growing so fast, no one should care about their current EPS or revenue. Without the pandemic, you could imagine a $3-4 billion of annual revenue within 6 years. Compared to most companies, their cost of revenue is super low (20%). The research & development cost can scale pretty well (if you have 10 times more users, you can afford 10 times more software engineers, but you don't \*need\* 10 times more engineers). Same for ""General and administrative"". And their cost of sales and marketing would probably go down when they leave exponential growth (most of the revenue coming from recurring customers, it costs less to keep them than to get new customers). So, if they were dominant in that field, I could see them having a profit of 40% for their core business. They would probably use most of that do diversify, invest in new products,... (like Google is no longer just a search engine, profits from the engine funded their investments in other projects). But for an investor that's equivalent, that's money which grows the value of the company. In that situation, you would get $1.2-1.5 bn of profit/year.  Let's say they have an EPS of 20 then, that means a valuation of 24bn --> share price of $96 in 2026. So, if I want a return > 5%, I would pay at most $68 in 2019. Which was basically the share price back then.

&#x200B;

**Questions to ask now that there is Covid19**

How does covid change the company valuation? I don't think the personal use matters directly: those users are unlikely to get a paying account. And people will stop drinking over Zoom after the pandemic (at least not nearly as often). The money will come from professional accounts. But those free personal account can help as a marketing tool, getting people used to the tool, everyone talked about Zoom.

The questions are: 

1. For how long people are required/encouraged to work from home because of the pandemics
2. Does this significantly change culture after the pandemics?
3. What shares of the professional video conferencing does Zoom capture?
4. What are their margin on revenue?

My estimates would be:

1. Lots of variance, but I guess a large share of the jobs which can be done remotely will be encouraged to work remotely, at least part of the time, until enough people have been vaccinated to reach herd immunity (hard to predict but end of 2021 is reasonable).
2. If it lasts for so long, many companies will have put things in place making remote work easier. People will have gotten better at this. Most people will return to the office, but I bet it will change the remote-work culture in a big way.
3. That's the biggest interrogation mark for me. Because of the quality of product, tons of users used the free version during the pandemics (even though there are many other free services). So the name recognition is almost universal. When somebody will think about choosing a video conferencing service, Zoom will be on their mind. But they will only keep those users if they are worth it: they seemed to work better, but they have to keep their competitive edge.
4. I'm not that worried about margin, their cost of revenue has consistently been under 20%. I don't see cost of cloud computing going up significantly. Their main cost has been sales and marketing. This is expected when you are in exponential growth phase, the percentage will decrease later. The main threat is if competitors push the price down. For this, they have to make a product good enough that companies will choose to pay for Zoom, rather than using free versions (like Microsoft teams included in office, or google meet).

**Estimating the value**

So, is Zoom overvalued? To be worth $240 today, I would like them to be worth $300 in 5 years, in 2020 dollars (5% inflation-adjusted annual return). 

If anything, the pandemics accelerate their growth, upfronts it.  In 5 years, they will be mature without easy room to grow in developed markets (at least for their videoconferencing product). So their value would come from their earnings, not expected growth. Price share of $300, means a company valuation of $83bn. To justify a $83bn valuation, I would like at least $4.1bn of profit (P/E ratio of 20), preferably $5.5 (P/E ratio of 15). Let's say $5bn

What would it take to get $5bn of profit? I'll assume their cost of revenue stay at 20%, their administrative go from 10% to 5% (economy of scales), marketing goes from 50% to 20% (market is more mature), research and development stays at 10% (important to keep their edge). That means their profit could be 40% if they did not see investment opportunities. So to get $5 bn of profit, they would need $12.5bn of revenue.

Can they get to $12.5bn of revenue (in 2020 dollars)? They price their main service at $20/month/host. So they would need 50 million paid accounts (less than that if you count higher priced items like zoom rooms). 

Those may be for people working from home, companies which have more than one office,... My guess is that most worker who could work from home, could benefit from good videoconferencing. Even if they work at the office, they might use it to meet with people in other buildings. In my previous companies, all our conference rooms were equipped with Zoom, we all had accounts, even though nobody was working full-time remote.

Before covid 5% of the workforce worked from home, both in the US and EU (total of 20 million). But 50 to 70% of people could work from home (so > 200 million people, just with US and EU). Counting the whole world, I could see 400 million regularly using videoconferencing for work (growing population, countries like China switching from manufacturing to service as they develop,...). Most won't need it often enough to justify paying for it. So free solutions will do for them. But I could see 150 million people paying for a good videoconference service, and 50 million of them choosing Zoom.

Is it optimistic? Maybe. But if remote work grows, if colleges use Zoom for some classes,... Fifty million accounts is far from absurd. And, again, that's not counting their other products (right now: Zoom Rooms, Zoom Video Webinars, and Zoom Phone, maybe others in the future).  


**Option play?**  
That's where I'm really not sure. It's not clear to me that Zoom is over or undervalued. But there is a lot of variance. If they become the dominant player, they are under-valued, if Microsoft crushes them with Team they are way overvalued. I don't see much middle ground. So I would probably do a straddle with deep OTM calls and puts very long-dated (like 01/2022). But, of course, the Implied Volatility of ZM is high, so those options are expensive.

I bought some 01/2022 $160 calls when ZM was around $115 (just after the price crashed from Facebook announcement, I thought it was dumb, I don't see companies using Facebook for their video-conferences and that's where I see the money). But I sold those when ZM reached $150, for a 90% profit (if I sold today, I would have gotten > +300% profit). 

Again, I'm not a stock analyst, and I don't have experience in the videoconferencing field.

EDIT: Since I detail how I came up with the valuation. You can easily plug-in your own estimations of paid users in a few years, and return target (Eps when mature, return until then) to get to your esfimation of ZM value.

714,Direction Play: Net Short via Puts for mid April,,493,fr1rsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fr1rsd/direction_play_net_short_via_puts_for_mid_april/,1585465478.0,"**Short-term Bull Case**

Fund rebalancing will continue on 30th and 31st to close the month/quarter. Probably an additional $300B or so rotation into equities. It's tough to gage this because I'm sure a lot of rebalancing occurred last week, but it's definitely not finished. Some funds may rebalance a bit later on April 1st; we don't really know all of their timelines. JPM is tracking this and initially said fund rebalancing was on the order of $850B for March and as of Friday is about 40%-45% complete. Last week's bull run may not be over, but we'll see this week how the market responds to the virus accelerating in the US.

Our relief rally might extend through Tuesday with some volatility and perhaps peak at SPY 270 where the option market is priced on the upside (we know for certain that there's a lot of selling pressure at 269. High odds of holding, but ultimately we don't know). There's some minimal bets on 290 and 300 because if 270 breaks there's not much in the way to 300 from a technical perspective, but this is low odds.

**Medium-term Bear Case**

On the flip side, as we hit 255-260 last week massive put positions were opened in the 200-220 range for both April and May and I witnessed accumulation at 190 for the first time. Some of this is hedging I'm sure, but there are transactions which are very clearly bearish. There's a lot more put activity on SPY & SPX Apr/May puts, which opened on Thursday & Friday. I can give more examples if needed. For those that think it's all hedging or selling, that's not the case. It's pretty easy to identify bear put spreads or larger directional plays. It doesn't make much sense to hedge in 50,000 lots, so these transactions are more obvious. Of course, hedges themselves are bearish because the longs believe there's a significant chance of a retest.

As the buying pressure lets off by Apr 1, we'll get the next week of jobless claims on April 2 and unemployment data on April 3rd. We may or may not sell off in advance of these events on April 1st, but regardless I'm very confident that Apr 1-3 will be net negative and likely begin the trend towards a retest of March lows. As we continue in April, the coronavirus will continue to ravage and spread across the US where we start seeing most hospitals in several major US cities overwhelmed and infection/death statistics hitting new highs. Sadly, it looks to me like the US healthcare system is less prepared than countries in Asia and US demographics are at much higher risk of death than populations in Asia. In two weeks from now, call it Apr 11, we'll likely see 2,000 deaths per day and over 4m infections (total count, which includes millions not tested). It's difficult for people to comprehend the exponential function of the virus spread but the growth factor in US is about 1.25 and Trump has no plans to institute a nation-wide lockdown for 6-10 weeks so the virus will flourish (all countries which halted the spread initated nation-wide lockdowns). And last of all, there's many buyers thinking this is a bottom, indicating it's not, and massive long-only funds are not going all-in. They are merely cherry picking a few names and dipping their toe in. Pretty soon these bull events will be priced in and the negative news will rain down in mid April.

**Positions**

Playing April puts is still quite risky and very expensive so I take a pass on that. I've been building put positions for 5/15 in the range of 200-230 and the same for SPX 2000-2200. This is conservative enough for me. I considered June with lower IV, but my research points to something happening in mid April so paying a theta premium for June didn't make sense even though the vol is cheaper. I also think markets tend to react *before* something happens so I think May gives enough time. If SPY rose to 270 and VIX fell to say 50-55 then I would certainly jump on some June puts, perhaps even 230P or 240P; but this is low odds. In this market a VIX in the 40s is very cheap (3%-4% moves when realized vol is 5%-7%, even 9%-12%) and VIX in 50s is quite reasonable; arguably cheap as well since we haven't bottomed and MM are short gamma causing extreme swings.

I'm long puts and long equity, but net short. I keep my option strategies fairly simple and focus more on the research side. I think a bear put spread is good idea for a short position or just long puts if you can time it right (buy low) and willing to take the risk of losing 60%-80%. But the upside on these is more like 100%-200% which is why I'm playing them. There's a pretty massive put spread opened March 20 around 11:10am for 80k contracts on APR17 puts. Long APR17 235P 80k at 12.46, short APR17 210P 80k at 5.44 for a debit of around 55m expiring 4 weeks out. The 210P also had 30k-50k lots purchased as the market fell on March 26th, closing out a huge OI of 254k contracts. The most unusual option activity I found was on March 25 and 26: SPY OCT16 260P 230,000 contracts opened for $700m.

I only buy OTM options to use gamma to my advantage. I try to avoid near-the-money and deep OTM, which is why I'm avoiding <200 and >240.

**Risk**

This market is definitely headed lower to retest March lows. Where I can be wrong is the timing. A true bottom might only form in May or June depending on how events develop, namely 1) the virus 2) solvency

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Thank you for the positive feedback. Since this post is well received, I'll try to answer some of your questions and provide further analysis.

**Effects of the option market on the underlying**

Market makers hedge when they are short options. Large blocks of option transactions have material impacts on the underlying because market makers must delta hedge those positions. It's pretty simple to remember: if you open a new long position of an option contract, the seller takes the short side of that option, so to hedge the seller must take the long/short of the underlying. E.g.

&#x200B;

|You buy calls (+)|MM buys shares (+) to hedge|
|:-|:-|
|You buy puts (-)|MM shorts shares (-) to hedge|

And when these positions unwind (close) the opposite effect takes form. This has a sudden material impact when large funds are buying and selling 1k, 5k, 10k, 30k, 50k lots.

**Technical Analysis: My Opinion (debatable)**

There is some legitimacy to technicals, which is why funds pay 200k+ salaries for technical analysts. Technicals work best when the greatest number of people believe them, so major technicals are most reliable. Things like volume, RSI, 200-day MA, 200-week MA, historical bottoms (major support lines), retracements. That’s about all the TA that I follow and it only forms a small part of my analysis, specifically for when to enter/exit after I’ve completed fundamental analysis on direction. When I say most reliable I mean they work >50% of the time but nowhere near 100. Don't forget, many algos are programmed to trade on technicals. Please avoid any con artists on Youtube drawing lines everywhere with crayons. When the market sold off in Feb & March there was huge uncertainty, so the only thing that was reliable were technicals and that’s what the market fell back on. The market high is 339 and the recent low is 218. A 50% retracement is 278 and as we fell from market highs we saw technicals play an important role in price action as many 50% retracements came to fruition. We don’t have to perfectly retrace at 50%. Since there is so much more fear in the market and perhaps some front-running, it makes sense that we might only retrace 40% (combined with other DD). It’s not just about the numbers, but what events are DRIVING the technicals. You need to combine it with further research.

**Analyzing the other side of the trade: positioning.**

When we hit the short-term bottom at 218-220 the VIX was fading because speculators & hedges were taking profits and starting to go long. This makes complete sense because long options are bets on volatility and if you’re holding puts as the market tanks 30%-34% while the VIX hits all-time highs THIS was your time to sell. I mean if you didn’t sell, what were you waiting for? We saw bullish positions opening in 250, 260, 265, and 270 but the magnitude was far less because these calls were so cheap. So you have puts closing with 10x the value of the calls that were opening and the VIX fades.

As we approach SPY 260 we start to see some call positions closing near 260 and large put positions opening. This provides resistance around 260. The effect would be much, much greater at 270 because most of those APR17 250, 255, 260, 265, 270 calls need to be closed. Many of these call positions cannot remain open because if they were opened in the 220s they have now gone 5x-12x and must be closed as we approach expiry. At the same time, at 260 it’s suddenly a lot cheaper to play the downside or hedge to the downside so new put positions will cause further downward pressure.

On the long equity side, longs will see 1 week returns upwards of 20% at these 260-270 levels so they are likely to take profits because these funds normally salivate over 11% annualized returns. You also have huge ETF/Mutual Fund buying which caused dog shit companies to have dramatic returns last week even though they are still dog shit. This is another point of weakness when sentiment shifts.

**Is this selling over?**

There’s a bit of a lag with some long-term holders getting to the point where they freak out and sell. This is the type that either checks their portfiolo less than once per month or the type that clenches their seat as their portfolio sinks 40% because “you can’t time the markets” and “stocks only go up.” Except the emotion will weigh on them as we fell from 339 to 218, bounce to 260, and will turn in April. Once they realize this isn’t a v-shape recovery the emotion will get to them. In April, many people will get their March statements and clue in that the market is in really bad shape, so there’s more selling to come.

You don’t get the fastest sell off in history and VIX at all-time high unless something is seriously wrong. Complete economic paralyzation, record unemployment, incoming bankruptcies, pandemic uncertainty, oil sector & airline industry blowing up, permanent change to consumer behavior, and record leverage in the financial system do not allow for a quick recovery. It may take some time for this to develop but it’s a decent indicator. Historically, bear markets last closer to 9 months, the median time to return to all-time highs is 2 years, and a market bottom usually forms around 2 months after the VIX peaks. Feel free to fact check these (consider the magnitude of this bear) because I haven’t looked at these stats in awhile. Point is, the market isn’t going to fix itself in April.

**Disclaimer**

EDIT: Just want to add a bit of a disclaimer here if anyone is thinking of acting on this. I'm not here to offer investment advice. I'm just here to share my opinion on what I'm observing in the market, what I am doing as a result, and why I'm doing it. Hopefully I welcome different perspectives on these subjects and constructive criticism. If I mention specific numbers in my post it just means that those numbers hold significance to my analysis but in no way shape or form does it mean we are guaranteed to hit those numbers with accuracy. Maybe the markets crank up to 265 but reverses hard. Maybe oil tanks 20% tomorrow and drags the market with it. Maybe some outlier bear news hits the tape on Monday morning and the bull trend dies. To be successful in trading it's more about risk management, so don't go all-in on trades. Develop a thesis, stick to defined rules, be disciplined. Gradually work into your trades and gradually work out of your trades (or just exit 95% of it if you hit some pre-existing profit goal). Good luck!

718,Rules of Risk Management,,491,in7r1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/in7r1n/rules_of_risk_management/,1599335797.0,"Given the current environment and with the past two days wiping out many new traders, I feel that it is appropriate to post my Rules of Risk Management, which have been requested by others on previous posts.

As a former fund manager and trader/investor with two decades of experience under my belt, here are the rules I have developed for myself concerning the trading of options:

**1) Never invest with money that you cannot afford to lose.** This is the cardinal rule of risk management.

**2) Limit your overall exposure in any single position** (this includes multiple directional positions on the same underlying) to a maximum percentage of your portfolio that does not exceed 1% for larger accounts ($100k+) and 2.5% for smaller accounts ($10k and below).

**3) Always analyze the direction of implied volatility prior to entering a trade.** Only look at debit strategies when IV percentile is low and only look at credit generating strategies when IV percentile is high. In situations where you decide to take a directional trade (bullish or bearish), the use of spreads is recommended when IV is elevated as this will negate much of the risk associated with both Vega (volatility decay) and Theta (time decay).

**4) Longer time horizons are advisable in selecting expiration dates for debit positions** and the use of shorter duration credit spreads can significantly reduce your risk, thus elevating your probability of profit.

**5) Where liquidity is concerned - only trade options that are highly liquid**, meaning that they have high open interest and, thus, tighter bid and ask spreads, which will significantly lower the slippage on each trade you take.

**6) Asymmetry of risk - only enter debit positions that offer 2 or more units of potential reward for every unit of risk.** This means that if you're risking $1 on a trade, your potential return should be at least $2. For credit positions, this is not feasible, thus, the tradeoff becomes taking in a credit with an exceptionally high probability of profit, which provides a positive expected value on the trade (for those of you unfamiliar with the term expected value - there's this thing called Google).

**7) Maintaining a cash position of greater than 50% of your portfolio value is always advisable** (I personally maintain 80% cash at all times). You never know when a position is going to go against you or when an exceptional trade/investment opportunity will arise, thus you want to be in a position of optionality with respect to taking a new favourable position or adjusting an existing one.

**8) Scale into your positions by laddering your orders.** This is especially important for those with larger account sizes since you can attain much better average prices on your positions by buying incrementally (or selling credit positions incrementally). For example, if you have $1,000 to allocate to a single position (assuming a portfolio value in excess of $100k), you can allocate $250 in 4 separate orders (or $500 in 2 separate orders). Conversely, when selling your positions, you should always scale out, which will allow you to ride your winners much longer than you normally would by incrementally taking risk off the table, which detaches you emotionally from your trade.

**9) Manage your emotions and avoid FOMO.** Option trading is a strategic game that should be done with much care, patience, and discipline. By managing your emotions and working strategically, as a trader, you will develop a pattern of decision-making, which is integral to your profitability and success over a long time horizon. FOMO is a terrible thing because it causes you to chase trades that have already passed you by. Focus on your trades, not what everyone else is doing.

**10) Put aside money for taxes and live within your means.** Assuming you follow the above rules (and have a solid fundamental understanding of how options and the financial markets work), you should see profits in the long run, which means that you need to be disciplined in squirrelling away money for tax purposes (so that JPow and his band of merry morons can continue giving it away to those of you who are living off of everyone else). Read up on the tax laws where you reside and if you're generating enough profits, hire a proper accountant to take care of your taxes for you.

**Bonus rule:** Document all of your trades in a trade journal - if you DM me, I'd be happy to send you a copy of the excel template I use.

\-----

Godspeed and if you're serious about making your money work for you long-term instead of working for your money long-term, memorize these rules and apply them. Or don't, and continue chasing tendies like the majority of undisciplined individuals I've come across while repeatedly saying ""would you like fries with that?"".

The choice is yours.

As of right now, the stock is bordering around $98. At PM or even when the markets open, are there going to be strikes prices even further OTM than $115 maybe to like $200??

Having said this, wouldn’t this result in another gamma squeeze since I know call sellers will have to hedge by buying more shares but it would only drive up share prices which also makes more calls ITM??

I’ve done enough lurking here and after off-loading SPY, DIS, and BA puts in February and March, I like most of you found the easy money printer jammed. Powell has his, but where is ours? Diamond-hands Johnny over there is 16 days away from watching his puts expire worthless and one margin call away from moving back in with mom. But after spending some serious time reviewing oil production, output, supply, storage, demand, and the bickering between Russia and Saudi Arabia – I have the next big move and it’s not priced in yet. The best part is it doesn’t matter if you’re bearish or bullish, this position is agnostic to both and stands to benefit from the current developments in the oil market.

While everyone is obsessing over covid-19 and refreshing the John Hopkins website for total confirmed cases, we are massively underpricing the 2-sigma event of which was the absolute drowning in oil supply as Russia and Saudi Arabia launched their pissing contest. The timing of this could not be better, and by better I mean worse. Though the words collusion may be premature, both Putin and MBS stand to benefit greatly from the collapse of US shale and as history shows, watch those who stand to gain. So why did I mention timing? Because this race to the bottom started off just as covid-19 began to take hold of the US. For date references, OPEC+ asked Russia to cut on 3/5/2020, Russia stalled, disagreed, and OPEC responded by removing all production caps on 3/6/2020. During this same period, covid-19 was spreading in stealth across the US. Again, dates for reference, on 3/4/2020 the number of cases in NY jumped from 2 to 11. Within 3 days, on 3/7/2020, Governor Cuomo declares a state of emergency. By 3/15/2020, the states of NY, NJ, and PA have requested all non-essential businesses to shut down. So regardless of the OPEC chess move, the US was destined for a demand shock in oil as the economy shutdown. That alone would have proven difficult for the already levered shale players. But throw the massive global supply on top of that and you might begin to see the magnitude of what’s at hand.

Ok, so what’s my play? Shorting shale is expensive with vol still elevated and not much more room as most trade towards zero. Long oil could take months to play out, and that is passing up on one too many opportunities in this market. So what is it? Well, the massive supply needs to go somewhere. And those giant tanks we have on land? They’re running out of space. According to the EIA, the US strategic reserves have a maximum storage capacity of 713 million barrels with 635 million barrels in the reserves already as of 3/13/2020. How much longer can we expect to dump oil into the reserves? Good question, on average, the US consumes 20.5 million barrels per day. So a rough estimate in days is 4. So, 4 days from 3/13/2020, no more space for oil storage on land. Okay, I get the calculation is dirty because US consumption does not zoom completely to 0 but the math is still relevant. Because even if we say the math is wrong by a factor of 4x, that’s 16 days. We’re still out of space as of yesterday. Drillers and pumpers already know this – so they’ve been chartering oil tankers out for months at a time. You can quote me on this: giant floating tanks of oil, typically used for transporting oil across oceans, will instead be repurposed to act as storage facilities during this oversupply event. This is not the first time these boats were used for this reason, same thing was done in 2015-2016. For those who want to know the mechanics, daily spot rates to reserve one of these VLCCs has risen from an average of $30,000/day to over $250,000/day. Keep in mind, boat expenses will not vary much, crew, food is all fixed – so nearly every additional dollar at the topline can flow to the bottom. We are talking about a potential for 3-5x in net income for some of these names.

I have near and long dated calls on DHT, EURN, FRO, and STNG. Even though some of these names have the potential to 4x, a conservative 1.5x-2x OTM call is still very cheap. And though there are varying nuances between the fleet mix and whether the boats are contracted already vs spot, the general thesis will hold here, these boats will be in high demand and oil regimes are going to pay top dollar. If you’re still not convinced, the president of STNG just purchased options to buy 315k shares of the stock at a $15 strike. As further evidence this trade will likely play out, I only entered a starter position on Monday, believing post-month end would result in a pullback in general equities, potentially giving me a chance for cheaper calls. That did not play out, the underlying of all the oil tanker tickers defied the -4.0% the indices got slapped with on Wednesday. This morning’s crude prices jumped on the hopes that Saudi-Russia will reach a truce, I have little faith these pops are sustained because both Russia and Saudi Arabia have shown how entrenched they can and intend to be, touting how many years they can keep prices low. Russia has dedicated an entire cash and oil reserve for this battle and have prepared for this for months. Anyone would be remiss to think this spat will calm before their goal is achieved – and that is ultimately to bankrupt US shale companies. Until we see blood and chapter filings, this is far from over. I will be adding to call positions as the underlying looks cheaper today.

TLDR: oversupply of oil is forcing storage to expand from land to sea; oil tankers stand to benefit.",options

Manually building trades will be a thing of the past. With Waffles, select the strategy you would like to build and let Waffles do the work for you. That's it. What used to take know-how, time and tedious work and now takes a click.

735,Lesson From This Week's Volatility - Risk Management,,440,innl2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/innl2v/lesson_from_this_weeks_volatility_risk_management/,1599404949.0,"The markets handed a tough lesson this week to many options traders. Some may never return, most  will be licking their wounds for weeks or months, and a very few will take this as an opportunity to trade the carnage. The lesson to learn is not about your trading strategy or indicators, but risk management.

I have worked as a market strategist for the past 15 years alongside a few thousand retail and institutional investors in foreign currency, futures, equities and options. A common experience amongst self-directed investors is a repetitive string of small winners, followed by a few big losses that wipe out weeks or months of gains. This is because the common theme with successful traders isn’t their strategy or which indicators they use, but rather their process for risk management.

There is no shortage of empirical evidence and studies, examining how humans skew our view on risk and reward. Research shows that accepting a loss is viewed to be twice as painful compared to the same amount of gain. This leads to the behavior of hanging onto losers far too long and closing winners far too soon. 

The reality of investing is that there will be losing trades and one must first accept this as a fact. In my experience, it is the pursuit of preventing small losses that ironically triggers some of the largest losses. We may have all experienced having a small loss, adding to the position with the hope of getting back to breakeven, only to have the position decline even further into a larger loss. Unfortunately, some investors will compound this habit, resulting in a total account blowup or loss. This begs the question; how do we trick our brain into turning this around?

To help with this quirk of human nature, professionals turn to a rules-based approach. First, there needs to be a decoupling of the concept of winning trades from being profitable. While the two are correlated they are not bound together. Most investors that struggle, make the incorrect assumption, that if they just win more often, they will be profitable. However, evidence shows that it is far more likely that a few big losses are typically what pushes accounts into the negative. To this point, the primary focus of investors is not to prevent losses in the first place, but only to prevent large losses. This can be achieved through discipline with the help of trading tools such as stop loss orders, option strategies with limited risk, and never risking more than 2% of your account per trade. Moreover, it is best to never add risk to a losing position.

Trading is an infinite game, not a finite game, yet 95% of traders still try to ""win"" every trade. There is no such thing as winning in trading, when you focus on the wrong goal, that's when you spin your wheels and get nowhere.  If you don't understand this, do a quick google search on ""finite vs. infinite game"".

Take this lesson into next week, if you're in a losing position on Friday's close and ""hoping"" to get yourself back to breakeven next week, think twice if it's worth blowing up the rest of your account for it. Or do you take a loss and regroup?",options

I’ve pointed this out to a few people, but figured everyone could benefit from understanding why this is important. All it takes is a $0.01 difference to make up for the commission paid. Let’s look at an example.

You’re looking to buy a call, bid is $4.99 and ask is $5.01. On RH, you’re likely going to have to pay the ask, so you get filled at $501 for 1 contract. At another broker, you can get filled at the midpoint or the bid. Let’s assume the midpoint of $5. Order is filled and you pay a total of $500.65 ($500 for the contract + $0.65 for the contract commission). 

This is a small example on an option with a tight spread, but what about when volatility rises or there options are illiquid? Let’s look at another example. 

Looking to buy a put. Bid is $8.50, ask is $9.00. At RH, which has poor execution quality, you get filled at $8.80 so $880 total. At a reputable broker, you get filled at $8.75 and pay the $0.65 commission, so $875.65 total. Which would you rather pay? 

But OP, RH fills me at the same price. No, no they don’t. There is actually a lawsuit against them right now for not filling at NBBO. 

Also, payment for order flow is negotiated by each individual broker. This information is all published in the broker’s 606 Report. Read about execution quality. Read about price improvement. 

You are much better off paying commissions at one of the big 4 rather than getting “free trades” at one of these start ups that have other glaring problems. Again, execution quality only needs to be better by $0.01 per contract to makeup $0.35 in savings on the total.   

This is a difficult concept to grasp, because people can see the commissions they are paying on paper and assume the price they get filled at is irrelevant to bottom line. For said reason, don’t place market orders or stop orders on options. Use your limit orders, get better fills, pay the commissions, and you will be much better off in the long run.",options

It is important to note this: Almost all of the data we have on outcomes of patients with COVID19 are from cohorts WITH SYMPTOMS. NO SYMPTOMS, NO GOOD DATA.

EDIT2: BONUS TRADE! When shit hit the fan, what did the president's team do? They gave him REGN-COV2, from REGENERON (REGN  $584 @9:00PM CST 10/2) It's an experimental drug, NOT FDA CLEARED, that sounds like basically an antibody infusion (similar to receiving plasma infusions from previously infected donors.

If I had to guess, I'd say the drug delivers more consistent and measurable doses of antibodies than if transfused with plasma which would be a more inconsistent dosage per dose. 

HERE's the upside!

The president will most likely recover with or without the drug, and it will not be clear if it helped at all. To me, that hedges against sell off in the event of his demise. 

__________________________________________________________________________________

Trump’s risk for poor outcome with COVID19 is relatively high given his age, obesity, sex, and medical problems not previously disclosed. 

the median time from onset of COVID symptoms to the time the person is intubated is 11 days. 

IF TRUMP IS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL, HE IS LIKELY VERY ILL. he will likely otherwise receive care within the white house unless his condition worsens.

HOWEVER, there will be a low threshold to admit him to the hospital because he is the president, and he will be put in intensive care regardless because he will receive 1:1 care

All patients 70-79, have 8% risk of death

If he is placed on ventilation (non-invasive bi-pap OR invasive intubation, his risk of death is 63% for all patients 70-79, equal men vs women, screwed higher for (Obesity, male, heart disease)

if he receives invasive or noninvasive ventilation, he has 29% risk for dialysis, and if placed on dialysis, risk of death is 79%.

median length of ventilation for all ages is 14 days.

FINAL CONSIDERATION, It isn’t death that is the deciding factor, it is the question: Can he fulfill his duty as President? 

ride your position until OCT 9-10, then take your profits.


EDIT: KEY point here: Admission to the hospital (not his ""Check up"" at Walter Reed at current) is the trigger. Also, we don't know if he is symptomatic, or simply has a ""Positive"" test. Yes I am aware he will be there a few days, but he is receiving an experimental drug that has not cleared the FDA and will require monitoring for adverse reactions. It appears that he basically needs a controlled setting for the drug, not so much an ""Admission"" for COVID 19. I don't buy that he would be there if not for the drug. He would be at home.",options

I will be starting on monday, currently have no positions.

Update:

I have been asked to add more details to ensure this is a valid post. I will try to be as descriptive here to hopefully avoid a takedown.

Account Setup: First, lets get out of the way, that to start you will need $1000 in a MARGIN account. Cash accounts usually don't allow spreads due to the collateral that is required. This isn't the same margin that you would use to purchase say $4000 of stocks, when you only have $2000. If you do that you are borrowing from the broker, and you pay them interest on that money. Because these are risked defined spreads, we can skate use margin, but not be charged for it because the broker knows we are only responsible for the difference between the strikes we choose.

Symbols: I am only looking for best of industry type of companies, and a slow and steady up trend. That means no ipos, spacs, and generally avoid earnings. These are too risky. So I'm playing things like aapl, amzn, fb, cost, sedg, ma, etc. I have about 30 that I use and am very intimate with so I am comfortable with their ranges. This is preferred to me compared to the scan and pray method. Wait of the setup, then strike. These have the benefit of a tighter bid/ask spread.

Setup: Ideally we are hugging the 20day or 50day sma line up, and are using that as support. Maybe recently there was a leg up, and we are building a base in a tight range for several days, looking likes its coiling, macd and rsi are oversold and are starting to curl up. Because Im playing quality companies, and I want to follow the trend, this means Im typically doing short put spreads, meaning I want the stock to go up in value.

Entry: Looking at the 40% ITM (in the money, delta is approx), 45 days to expiration. This is a starting point. I look at the chart to see where possible levels of support may be, and try to determine if the premium the 40% itm strike gets me is adequate. Im typically looking for $160 premium, $5 wide spreads, so a $340 collateral per position. But if the chart is telling me its about to take off, its at the bottom of its channel, then I may go more aggressive (as I did today in the apple position).

Exit: Right after I get filled, I enter a closing order for a 50% gain of the potential profit. This allows me to not have to watch the computer all day. I will check in once a day to see what the stock is doing. If needed I will roll puts up, or out for a credit.",options

751,Intro To Put Credit Spreads,,425,i9oulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/i9oulx/intro_to_put_credit_spreads/,1597421572.0,"&#x200B;

## What is a Put Credit Spread?

A Put Credit Spread (which we will refer to as a “PCS”) is a Options Spread that utilizes both long and short puts to minimize risk, and earn credit.

When you open a PCS, you are writing/buying 2 different contracts:

* You are **Selling a Put**, and receiving Premium for it
* You are using part of the Put’s premium to **buy a Put** under the Strike

&#x200B;

[Profit Graph for a Put Credit Spread](https://preview.redd.it/gq308ekuszg51.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b32551248411b2d5c3500e4529a6826eb508a1a)

When you open a PCS, you must hold cash as **collateral**. This can be calculated by the following equation:

*(Short Put Strike Price — Long Put Strike Price) x 100 = Collateral*

Since buying the Put costs less than the premium received from selling the Put, you end up with a net **Credit** to your account.

Now that I have explained the basics, lets clear any of your confusions with a simple example.

## Put Credit Spread Example:

>SPY is trading at 335 today

Now lets say that I am confident that SPY will stay above 330 for 1 month.

I only have $100 to spend on this PCS, so I have to pick strike prices that are $1 apart. For this example, I will:

* Sell a 30 DTE $330 Put on SPY for $6 in Premium ($600)
* Buy a 30 DTE $329 Put on SPY for $5.50 in Premium ($550)

**Now that we have opened our PCS, lets break down our returns.**

Our net credit that we recieved is 600–550 → $50Our collateral needed was (330–329) x 100 → $100Our % Gains on Collateral are 50%

**Now lets look at all the possible outcomes on Expiration.**

* SPY expires above $330: We walk away with a $50 profit.
* SPY expires at $329.50: We break even, because our $50 loss on our spread is offset by our $50 in premium that we receive.
* SPY expires between $329.50 — $329: We start to lose money, which can be calculated by *(($330 — Expiration Price) x 100) — Premium ($50)*
* SPY expires below $329: We reach our max loss, which can be calculated by the equation: *Collateral — Premium*

>*Great job, we just ran through a realistic example on what a Put Credit Spread would look like!*

Now let’s look through some tips to maximize your profits, and finding that perfect balance between risk and returns.

## Tip #1 → Choose a Stock that you are Bullish on

When you open a PCS, you are betting that your stock of choice will trade above a certain price.

Because of this, it is important to only open Put Credit Spreads on stocks that you are bullish on.

Do not choose a stock solely because of its high premiums, as they are high for a reason; that stock will be much more volatile than others.

## Tip #2 → Follow a Concrete Exit Plan

When a PCS turns out to be too risky, or is near worthless, it may be better to try and close the position.

You should have a very clear exit plan that you will stick to no matter what, as PCS’s can reverse and tank very easily.

A very popular “Theta Gang” strategy is to close any positions once they reach 50% profits, and never close at expiration.

## Tip #3 → Diversify Your Strategy

If you have a medium-large size account, then you will have enough cash in collateral to open up numerous PCS’s.

In this case, do not put all your cash on one stock, as if it reports bad news, your entire account could be wiped out.

Instead, choose your favorite stocks from each sector, or use ETF’s to lower your individual risk of a stock crashing.

## Tip #4 → Dont Play for Pennies

Although there are many options strategies that utilize small gains over long periods of time, Put Credit Spreads are not one of them.

If you sell PCS’s for pennies or low premiums, then one bad trade will lose months worth of gains.

Although it may seem more risky, upping your strike price on a bullish stock can contribute to higher returns.

## Tip #5 → Don’t Make Your Spread too Wide

When you open up your PCS to wider strikes, you are required to hold more cash as collateral, because your max loss is greatly increased.

If you want to play it safer, it may be beneficial to open up PCS’s at different strikes, rather than keeping your PCS wide.

EDIT: I was asked to put this into the article, as an explainer for some confusion:

Break even, max profit, and max loss values ONLY APPLY AT EXPIRATION. You can only gain the full premium, or reach your max loss potential if you hold your contracts till expiration. Many people prefer to close out of contracts in a specified amount of time, like 1 month, or 30dte.

Max profit comes with max risk and max holding time, so please, CLOSE YOUR POSITIONS BEFORE EXPIRATION. To learn more about this, you can see this article: Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (Redtexture).",options

### How to ask Smart Questions and get Smart Answers

If you're not sure about any of the below,   
post to the weekly Noob Safe Haven Thread,  
your post most probably belongs there. 

**A few tips to avoid shitposts on the main thread   
(shitposts will be taken down):** 

- Have a meaningful title describing the topic. ""Help"" is not meaningful. 
- State the underlying ticker, strategy, strikes, expiration, price on entry     
- What was your original plan? Did something go wrong and you are looking for help? Be specific.

- If you are exploring an idea, stay on the side of being more verbose than terse. If it takes 12 responses to weed out all the details, it's a shitpost (and you know what happens next).

- Want to start a thread about something else just to chat? Fine, just make sure you don't sound like /wallstreetbets  is paying a visit.

- Not sure about any of the above? Just post. The worst that will happen is it will be taken down, there's no public shaming. Send the ModMail, it works.

- Don't link to external sites with paid services. It's ok to mention relevant content in a context of a discussion, but link posts with no commentary are spam, and will be taken down promptly.

- Finally, for multi-leg positions stick to a commonly accepted form, like:
  - 200/210 short call spread (or credit call spread)  
  - 195/200/240/245 long iron condor  
  - 205 long call

754,The TSLA 2K Play - A Trade Retrospective on Taking a $.21 Credit to Make $8.34 More,,416,ieq3uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ieq3uq/the_tsla_2k_play_a_trade_retrospective_on_taking/,1598129149.0,"There are different ways to play TSLA to $2000 this past week. Here’s my thought process on how I approached trading the move up, without paying a debit (but uses margin).

# The Entry

On Monday, August 17, besides TOS being absolutely atrocious, TSLA was lurching higher, and at around 11am PST or so, when it broke out to new highs, my thought was that there’s probably going to be a short squeeze again that takes us to $2000, the target that basically everyone was looking at. So, I looked to put on a play that captured something to that $2000 price level by Friday, Aug 21 expiration. 

I began by looking at the 1980/2000 long call vertical. At the time, that spread cost $2.28 debit. So if I were to just put on that vertical, I would be paying $2.28 to make potentially $17.72. But I don’t really like paying large debits (large is anything above $.25 per spread), especially for these types of short-term directional bets. 

So I looked for other ways to reduce the debit. Alongside the purchase of the long call vertical, I also sold the 1650/1625 put vertical, for $2.05 credit. The reason for placing the short strike of the put vertical at 1650 is that it was under Monday’s low, and the reason for the long strike at 1625 was that it made the put vertical wide enough to collect a decent credit. Now, the total debit on the trade became $2.28 (debit of 1980/2000 call vertical) - $2.05 (credit from 1650/1625 put vertical), or $.23.

$.23 was pretty cheap, and honestly I could’ve stopped there. But as I was thinking about the trade, I realized I didn’t really like how the short put verticals actually added more downside risk to the trade. So I was thinking that as early as I could, I would buy back that short put vertical once it drained in value, as TSLA continued running up with the momentum it had. And given the huge upside momentum that day, I thought that TSLA would probably gap and continue higher the following day, or at the very least just move sideways, which would drain the value of the short put vertical and allow me to buy it back for a low debit.

However, if I bought back the put vertical before it fully drained to 0, then my overall debit on the trade wouldn’t just cost $.23 anymore - it would cost more. So in the spirit of keeping the debit as low as possible, I needed to actually collect more credit from somewhere else, if I really didn’t want to pay for this trade. So, I decided that I was going to sell a call vertical above the 1980/2000 long call vertical. And a safe enough distance above the long call vertical, would be up at 2200, which gives me 200 points of runway above 2000. So I sold to open the 2200/2250 call vertical, for $1.27 credit. 

I felt safe about selling the 2200/2250 call vertical, because for it to really be at risk, TSLA would first need to move above 2000, the psychological level, and by the time it starts to get near 2200, the 1980/2000 call vertical will be 20 points deep ITM, so I have 20 points of coverage.  Of course there’s still 30 points of risk (given that the 2200/2250 short call vertical is 50 points wide), but time is on my side. Assuming that TSLA even gets near 2200 on the last day, given how little time left there is, that short call vertical would probably be trading for maybe $10 or so, and the 1980/2000 long call vertical in front of that short call vertical, would be deep ITM and worth $20, so I can just close the entire spread at a profit anyway.

So after selling that 2200/2250 call vertical, the trade went from $.23 debit to $1.04 credit (because $.23 - $1.27 = -$1.04, or $1.04 credit). Now I’m getting paid to play the breakout to TSLA 2K.

# The Adjustment

On Tuesday, TSLA gapped up higher, and right off the bat, the short put verticals basically drained from $2.05 to $.83. I closed that out to remove any downside risk, so that if TSLA decides to reverse and tank, or hang out sideways and never make it to 2000, no harm no foul, I have the upside play on for a credit. Recall that $.23 (the debit of the initial entry) - $1.27 (the credit collected from the sale of the 2200/2250 call vertical) + $.83 (the debit of buying back the short put vertical) is -$0.21, which is a $.21 credit, after adjustments. And now, I just have to manage TSLA to the upside.

The result of this adjustment left me with a 4 legged spread where I’m long the 1980/2000 call vertical and short the 2200/2250 call vertical (this 4-legged spread is also called a condor, specifically a Call condor).

Throughout Tuesday and all of Wednesday, TSLA just moved sideways, and I was fine with that. Others who purchased naked long calls far OOM were worried about the premium drain, but I was fine knowing that I got paid to play the move to 2K, whether it happened or not. It completely did not matter if TSLA moved sideways or tanked, because it wouldn’t negatively impact the equity curve. Another reason why I actually liked TSLA hanging sideways is that it gives TSLA less of a chance to surge higher and run over that 2200/2250 short call vertical with the time left before expiry. 

# The Exit

Thursday was where the magic happened (for pretty much everyone). As we know at around 7:45 am PST, TSLA rallied from around $1900 to almost $2000, and the Call condor really started to expand in value. When TSLA was at $1990, the call condor spread expanded to $8.34. 

Recall that the cost on this trade (after the closing the short put vertical) put my cost at a $.21 credit. Now, I can sell this condor out and pocket another $8.34. That’s pretty sweet. Getting paid $.21 to make another $8.34.

(At this moment, I noted what the legs were trading for. The long vertical of the condor was trading for $9.27, and the short vertical was actually trading for $.93. Recall that when I entered the short vertical on Monday, I actually collected a $1.27 credit on it. Now, even after the 150 point move up in TSLA, even after volatility expansion, that short vertical was still worth $.34 LESS - that’s the power of theta decay). 

So at that point, I pretty much just closed out the entire position. I was pretty happy with essentially getting paid $.21 to make another $8.34 (in hindsight, I could’ve milked another $11.66 per spread, but that’s besides the point).

# FAQ

* **What if TSLA decided to tank upon entry, jeopardizing the short put vertical?**  
Upside conviction was strong, but I would have to buy it back and find a way to reduce the new debit on the overall trade.  

* **What if TSLA decided to make a run up to $2000+ very early on in the week (ie. on Tuesday it runs up to $2100)? Then the 2200/2250 short call vertical would’ve expanded too much and offset the gains of the deep ITM 1980/2000 long call vertical.**  
I would have to cough up the debit and buy additional call verticals to cover the upside. Perhaps a 20 or 30 point wide call vertical around the 2100 strike to cover the remaining upside risk, which would cost around $10-$15 debit. Then work to reduce that debit over the week.  

* **But what if TSLA decided to tank below 2100 after adjustment above? Or lower to below 1980? Or even further down?**  
Sell more 2200/2250 call verticals. Then sell out the long call vertical for whatever remaining debit. Then sell out the 1980/2000 call vertical for whatever value it has left.  

* **So many adjustments. KISS. You will just get whipsawed and use up a ton of margin.**  
It's just what I have to do. I have to be mechanical about the greeks and not play the hope card. This trading style is not for everyone and is not the holy grail.  

* **It’s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation?**

1) Sold 10x AAPL 375c 21Aug20 
2) Bought 10x AAPL 380c 21Aug20

The credit spread was about $3,000 at the time (mid-July), and max loss therefore should have been $2,000. 

I believe the short position was ITM, and long was ATM at the time, although this is irrelevant. 

This morning I received an email saying my short position was exercised (fuck me, I didn’t realize ex-div for AAPL was today). I’m assuming they exercised it yesterday to qualify for the upcoming dividend. My broker (Questrade in Canada) did nothing with my long position, so I’ve gone from a max loss of $2,000 to a much steeper one. I don’t know what to do.. 

Questrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt. However, the share price has dropped $10 already today, so my loss has likely gone from $2,000 to $12,000 and could get worse if this drop continues. I submitted the request to exercise the calls and I’m waiting for the shares. 

I entered this trade assuming my max loss would be $2,000. I thought questrade would require direction for the long position, cause I don’t have 380k to cover in my account. 

TLDR; entered what I thought was a covered credit position, to later be naked and forced into to a $380,000 long position.",options

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

For those of you following me from my ARCT position, what a week it had last week! Unfortunately the covered calls I sold canceled out most of the gains. Having said that, my position went from -500% to now only -20% for this ticker. Unreal.

I started trimming some of my other positions last week as they were hitting my profit target of 60-80%. Here are the tickers I have positions on: BIG, CRSR, FROG, FSLY, GME, OSTK, PLTR, SPCE. At this time the only one that will maybe get assigned is OSTK, but I will most likely end up closing it for a profit before it gets to that point. Most of my positions expire this week which means they will be highly volatile with price movement. It also means that as long as they stay AT-THE-MONEY or higher I will be receiving a good amount due to theta & delta. I'm not a gambling man so at this point I will sell once they hit around 50% profit. Most of these positions are at 40% profit so if Monday is green I will definitely sell. It's expiration week so these can swing very quickly in either direction. 

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

**JMIA - Jumia**

https://preview.redd.it/0mh3vgztwja61.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60768137354fc7c03954e0673c0b2a0a9de2879

JMIA took off in November and since then has been in steady uptrend following the channel. It had a dip recently where it found some buyers at the $32-35 level. Currently price at $37 I think a good spot to sell some puts here looking for break-even share price of $30. Keep in mind only the monthlies are available for this ticker so we will need to sell 5-6 weeks out. That's ok because it will still give us a kick in premium.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 19, 2021 $34 strike puts sold to open for $3.80 or $380 premium. Return: 11%.

Break-even share price: $30.20.

&#x200B;

**CRSR - Corsair**

CRSR was on my list last week and IMO while it's still under $38-40 range it is still a good time to sell the $35 strike put. It's currently trading at the support/resistance line. If it breaks below, maybe it will re-visit the bottom trend line around $35/36. This is where I will sell my puts. Selling the $35 strike put will give us a break-even price at roughly $31.50. This means even if the share price drops another 20% from this level we will still remain profitable.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 19, 2021 $35 strike puts sold to open for $3.40 or $340. Return: 10%.

Break-even share price: $31.60

&#x200B;

**PLTR - Palantir**

I've been selling puts on PLTR since the start of December and haven't been assigned once. It's been in the $23-28 range for about 6 weeks now and IV is still high. Share lock-up expiration is nearing. I believe the lock-up ends 3 days after they report earnings in early February. I'm going to sell Feb puts here anticipating a run-up into earnings and possibly selling just before depending on the share price. 

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Feb 12, 2021 $24 strike puts sold to open for $2.30 or $230 premium. Return: 10%.

Break-even share price: $21.70. << We are profitable as long as the stock stays above this price.

&#x200B;

**COTY - Coty Inc**

https://preview.redd.it/10igl5mwwja61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd6abc70b555593511d8a48bf3b28428a3bb4ced

Another new addition to the weekly watchlist. Similar to PLTR, COTY has been consolidating for 6 weeks now. Look at the coiling. IMO this could be ready for another small pop. Looking at some of the options it is not the most liquid of stocks. My preference in this case would be to purchase 100 shares and sell the $7.50 covered call 3 weeks out. The return on the covered call is about 3.7%. I'll be looking to collect the return on my shares as well as 3.7% from the CC. Keep in mind selling the CC 3 weeks out means you will most likely need to hold this position at least 2 weeks. In the case that the stock price takes off your CC will have an increase of \*extrinsic\* value meaning that even though your share price is rising, the covered call is off-setting those gains until we get a little closer to expiration and the extrinsic value goes down.

Positions on the watchlist:

1. Purchase 100 shares. Sell Jan 29, 2019 $7.5 strike covered call for $0.25 or $25 premium. At this moment you are collecting $25 on the CC per $680 spent on shares which makes the return on just the covered calls about 3.7%.

&#x200B;

**FEYE - FireEye**

FEYE has had some great momentum at the end of 2021. After such a huge spike drawing lines is kind of pointless. IMO some profit-taking occurred after those big rips and the stock is beginning to settle. I'm willing to take a chance selling the $21.5 strike puts here.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. 5 Feb, 2021 $21.5 strike puts sold to open for $1.25 or $125. Return: 6%.

Break-even share price: $20.25. A 10% drop from this level will still have us coming out profitable.

**SFIX - StitchFix**

SFIX stock price coming back down to reality after the share price more than doubled on last quarter's earnings report. It bounced off the $55 level a few days ago and is retesting it now. Short interest on this ticker is still pretty (\~40%) so maybe we'll see some covering before we get into next earnings. Selling $54 puts at this level can give us a cost basis of around $51 should we get assigned.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. 5 Feb, 2021 $54 strike puts sold to open for $3.10 or $310. Return: 6%.

766,Some lessons learnt in due course (with loss porn),,394,g24k2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/g24k2p/some_lessons_learnt_in_due_course_with_loss_porn/,1586997387.0,"Wrote originally for WSB. Someone suggested it would be applicable here as well. Some important lessons gained through course of time with options:

1. **Profits are never profits until you realize (book) the gains:**  I see many posts here saying 100k to 2k whereas they actually started  only with 10k: 10k->100k->2k. So it is actually 10k to 2k, not  100k to 2k. So never shy away from booking profits. If not entire gains,  atleast a fraction of it. It's okay to be greedy but combine some  common sense with it. Best would be to take out your initial amount and let the rest ride.
2. **Do not buy puts/calls when the market is gone too much down/up. Think opposite**:  A classic mistake that many of us make here. Me as well and lost a lot  due to this. So when your options become deep ITM, your portfolio bloats  up showing amazing gains?!? but what are the gains when you have not  booked them? Here is where the greed+FOMO kicks in and we end up buying  more OTM options for the same direction because we have made amazing gains (but they are not realized). When the market swings to other  direction, you have lost a lot: your ITM becomes OTM and your new OTM purchase becomes impossible. So again, never feel shy to book profits!
3. **Cannot daytrade?**  So tracking the options throughout day can be distracting, if you have a  job. If this is the case, there is nothing bad in set limit order with  profit margin acceptable to you. Set this thing and let it roll. If  market swings to your direction, you are going to make it automatically. Have a look near EOD or aftermarket and get an idea how markets are  moving. You can fine tune your sell limits, if needed.
4. **Gain/Loss porn:**  As we see, our sub is growing crazy and will continue so. This is  because the markets are going to have strong gradients till EOY. Gains  are only possible when the market moves and has gradients. So some will  cleverly/luckily make some good gains out of this. Gain porn is going to  attract a lot more people especially. Of course, equally or maybe more  people are losing here, and are probably keeping quiet. This being the  case, I down vote the gain porn and upvote loss porn. I am happy for  your gains but there should be more light on the loss to prepare the  noobs here.
5. **Never FOMO**:  Missed the train? It's okay. Let's wait for the next one. We are not  handling stocks here that you have a residue value that stays over the  time. We do options here and if you are OTM on the expiration date, you  are fucked.
6. **Play monthlies or longer**:  Playing weeklies without any significant upcoming news is sheer  gambling. Considering this, the theta decay will fuck you over the time.  My suggestion is to play atleast a month out and close them before the  very last week.
7. **Keep track of max pain**:  This might be controversial. I take this as additional info but not  sole one for decision making. Have a look into opricot.com to check max  pain before options purchase. For example, max pain for spy: [http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs](http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs).
8. **Try avoiding herd mentality**:  As a believer of max pain theory, try avoiding buying same options as  someone YOLOing ,for example $100k, into specific options. If max pain  is true, there is much more at stake for market makers. They will try  swinging market in the other direction, atleast for that expiration  date.

Obligatory loss porn: Total invested 8k. Started with 2k and added 6k after crash. That 6k evaporated. Exited my 4/17 puts today and withdrawn about 1k today. Peak was 23k.

Edit: Many have asked about max pain theory:

It’s a theory that option sellers try to influence the underlying stocks to cause maximum damage to option holders. In other words, sellers optimizing their profits:

Some of the people who achieve the largest rewards have taken correspondingly large risks. People who try to start their own business spend extensive time not making anything trying to make something. They may or may not make it, many don’t. Those who do make it, took the risk, persevered, earned the reward. I am too conservative to potentially risk everything for a potential reward.

As traders, our primary job is to be risk managers. Without an intimate understanding of risk, a traders tenure will very likely be limited. On the opposite, traders who are completely risk averse will not get anywhere and likely will end up net negative due to poor expectancy. 

Like most facets in life, trading requires balance. Finding proportional risk to reward is how we find success. Do not be afraid of risk. Do not be flippant towards risk. Once you find the balance, that’s when our capital begins to grow.

[On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.

Keep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice).

Lastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.

&#x200B;

Before we start, when you look at my charts:

**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:

1. Comes right back down into the channel or
2. Begins to form a new channel.

You will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.

**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**

All positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.

**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**

https://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7

DDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.

**Positions:**

$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%.

Break-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.

&#x200B;

**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**

https://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a

RKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.

**Positions:**

$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%

Break-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25

&#x200B;

**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**

https://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9

Revolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.

**Positions:**

$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%

Break-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15

&#x200B;

**PTON - Earnings last week**

https://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f

Peloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.

**Positions:**

$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75

$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114

**V - Not earnings play**

https://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0

Visa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.

**Positions:**

IV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.

&#x200B;

**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much ""safer"" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss.

&#x200B;

Listen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.

773,I'm about to inherit $200K and I want $200K to produce income for me using options,,385,iec41u,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/iec41u/im_about_to_inherit_200k_and_i_want_200k_to/,1598070203.0,"To preface this post, I have over 2 years experience trading options. I've successfully grown my $20K account to $65K over two years using a mix of buying and holding shares and doing relatively low risk options trades (LEAPs, PMCC, Short Puts). Now I'm about to inherit $200K and I intend to use the $200K strictly to produce income by managing low risk options trades such as the wheel strategy.

I absolutely love leverage which is why I'm eager to go with the PMCC approach. Let's take $AMD for example, a company I'm bullish on. You can purchase **50** x $50 calls expiring 1/21/2022 @ $39.50 with a delta of .86 which will take up $197,500 initial capital. Then I can sell **50** x 30 DTE calls between .30 delta and .45 delta for $235 or $400, respectively. Depending on what I anticipate coming up, I may either **not** sell a call until volatility blows over (earnings reports) or I would choose a higher probability trade to coincide with analyst price target changes or I would choose a lower probability if the stock is is consolidating. I have a possibility of producing monthly income ranging between $10,000 to $20,000.

If I go strictly with the standard wheel strategy, I would sell **25** x 30 DTE $80 puts with delta at .35 and close to 69% probability for a credit of $8,625. So we're looking at approximately $8,000 a month, give or take. If I get assigned, I would just flip and sell calls using the same guideline as above.

I would not mind getting assigned in either cases. My primary objective is to gain on premium, not so much on the underlying (although with LEAPs being leveraged by giving me 50 contracts to begin with, it'll give me a nice boost to profits).

What would you do in this case? Do you disagree with this approach? Other than the risk of being assigned, is there anything else I should be aware of before taking on this strategy? If you say diversify, then can you recommend a hedge or alt stock to trade on on a semi-active pattern?

Cheers.

**Edit:** the wide variety of opinions and suggestions I've gotten is deeply appreciated. Given the risky state of this market today, I'm considering a more diversified approach across multiple tickers and as well as real estate. I haven't decided what the plan would look like but once I go for it, I think I'll update /r/options with another post with results.

I’ve seen someone ask for advice about their naked option at least three times in the last day or two when they were describing a call that they’d bought so it seems to be a term that isn’t clearly understood by some new options traders.

Using a platform that isn’t RH is always a good idea as well since they can have some pretty wide spreads and don’t show all of the data, like volume and last sale price that are important.

I executed on all of them except SFIX and CRSRS because both of them shot up hard. The rest I entered and either exited at 75% profit or I am still holding. I want to begin to move to at least 40% cash since the market is extended at these levels. I will probably be slightly more patient with some plays going forward. Think I might just add a couple more puts sold to open on PLTR. As a side note, looks like I broke that $100k barrier for good now. When I started this journey with you all 2 months ago I was only at $75k.

Put-sellers RISE UP

# Old Positions

**ARCT:** even though I said I would hold until I was profitable I will be closing this. It will free up much more capital and allow me to make other trades now that it's closed.

**FSLY + OSTK**: These are in my zones to close the positions and will do so by EOD today.

**GME:** Currently holding $15 puts sold to open and they are still only 50% profit. Crazy how high the IV is that it's still giving good premiums for a put requiring a 60% drop in just 3 weeks. I want to sell more here, but I'm not sure about the risk/reward with how the stock is moving.

# New positions from this week

**JMIA:** This one rocketed up 15% the day after I sold puts which was great for me. They still have a few weeks to go so they aren't losing value that fast. I will hold through the 3-day weekend and re-evaluate next week.

**COTY, FEYE, PLTR**: All 3 of these pretty much haven't moved, so I'm waiting.

Just wanted to throw out this info for those thinking of playing NIO earnings or those that didn't know you could almost 100% guarantee profits with spreads/more advanced options strats. Also with that, less risk = less reward. The higher the probability of success, the lower max profit you will have.

Butterflies are a great way to play some more expensive stocks for cheaper! 1950/2000/2050 strikes, bought on Monday for Friday expiration! Max gains of ~5k if TSLA closes at 1999 tomorrow. Had two, sold one today to lock in profits and cover this second one.

They consist of:

1 long upper strike, 2 middle short strikes, and 1 long lower strike.

You can view them as a debit spread and credit spread combined. The bulk of the profits come from the lower strike, but as long as the stock is traveling in the right direction you’ll be profitable. Once the lower leg is in the money is when the $$$ really comes. They’re a pretty cheap way to play with huge upside.

Here is my TSLA from this week. 

https://i.imgur.com/mFkbF2D.jpg

Position:

1 BTO $1950c 8/21

2 STO $2000c 8/21

1 BTO $2050c 8/21

Now, while they can be used as “YOLOs,” I advise against that. They’re great when combined with company fundamentals, TA, and momentum/big news (TSLA split).

This is just a small little FYI because it wasn’t until a few weeks ago that I learned about butterflies and have been using them ever since with great success! Happy to answer any questions

Also: if you ever do play one of these, always close all the legs at the same time otherwise you are opening yourself to a lot of liability",options
796,"Unusual Options Activity from the week. LB, VXX, PINS, PTON.",,369,hydixo,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hydixo/unusual_options_activity_from_the_week_lb_vxx/,1595793259.0,"What's up my fellow options traders. Swaggy is back with a few plays that caught my eye from last week in the unusual options activity segment. A quick note about my [option flow sentiment tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I created and where I am scanning most of this data from. I noticed it was tracking WAY too much data, so in order to keep the accuracy higher, I've modified the script to analyze much more trades that would be marked as ""unusual"" instead of any block trade that was at the money. It is definitely much easier to look through the data now.

Here's a few things I spotted this week.

**LB - L Brands**

On Tuesday this week a player rolled out their long call position to a further OTM strike price. They sold their position of 15,000 January 2021 calls at the $17.50 strike price and collected almost $7 million in premium. They then opened a new position in the same expiration with 15,000 calls at the $22.50 strike price. Their original position was 7% in the money, the position they rolled out to was 20%(!) out the money for January 2021 expiration. I'm not sure what initial amount of capital they entered the position with, however, they were willing to risk $4 million on a 20% OTM play. Personally, this is the kind of unusual activity I like to see if I am going to enter a position. Very interesting. It's important to note from the graphic when someone rolls out a position vs entering a brand new position the sentiment will look the opposite. Usually they close out a larger position (in this case closing the original position was bearish), and enter a smaller position, but further expiration or strike price for less premium (in this case entering a new long).

**PINS - Pinterest**

PINS saw some notable bullish option flow come through this week. The largest position was on Wednesday where a player purchased 11k CALL contracts for November expiration at a strike price of $26 (3% OTM at the time). The position size was approx $4 million in premium. 11k call contracts, 3% OTM strike price, November expiration, all pretty bullish and qualify it for 'unusual activity'. The stock has been pretty stagnant since reaching high point of $26.50 a couple weeks ago.

**VXX - (VIX Short-Term Futures)**

For those unfamiliar with VXX, it tracks VIX which is a volatility play. On Monday last week I came across some bearish activity, betting that volatility would go DOWN by September. Multiple directional bets were placed in LONG PUTS and also a BEAR SPREAD where they purchased a long PUT closer OTM and sold a short PUT further OTM to reduce the risk on the play. In my opinion, this week and next week's earnings reports will provide us with guidance moving forward (as all companies refused to give guidance previously) and should ease the markets in terms of volatility. I think volatility might pick back up again as we get closer to elections and fall season of potential 2nd/3rd corona wave.

**PTON - Peloton Inc**

PTON has been a beast of it's own having very high volume in option flow recently. This lucrative meme stock is expected to blow earnings out of the water and the stock price has nearly doubled in the last 2 months. Last week witnessed a slew of bullish call option activity. They ranged from large bullish bets at the money, to selling puts, and also one September 18 bet for 1,000 CALL contracts with a premium of $330k and strike price of $80 (25% OTM). These are pretty directional bets with a high volume of contracts.

It looks like the one large 'bearish' sentiment activity could possibly be a fund selling a covered call on a larger share position. The strike price was $65 and 1.18% OTM at the time. If the stock stays above $65 they collect 1.18% return on the share position as well as pocket the $3.85 million in premium from selling the calls. Assuming they are covered calls that would mean the position size of the shares is 3k contracts \* 100, or 300,000 shares. Also assuming a current share price of about $65 means their entire share position (or at least the amount covered by the calls) is about $19.5 million. The $3.85 million they collect in premium + the 1.18% they could collect if the stock stay above $64 ish would be a 20% return overall on the play. Keep in mind they collect the premium from the covered calls regardless if the stock goes up or down, as it provides protection.

Peloton reports earnings in 2 weeks.

I came across 2 interesting plays today on my UOA scanner that I thought you all might find interesting!

**W - Wayfair Inc**

Player opened up a synthetic long position, where they buy the call and sell the put at the same strike. This kind of strategy ultimately has the same risk as going long on shares. What they did: They bought 2,600 July 17 calls at the $205 strike and sold 2,600 July puts at the $205 strike. Total dollars involved in the transaction was approximately $6.8 million in premium, which is quite a large position! I will be interested to follow the stock as those are relatively short-term expirations and they are expecting a big move up.

&#x200B;

**LULU - Lululemon Inc**

Minutes before the closing bell a player purchased 1,000 call contracts at the $305 strike for July 2nd expiration and a total premium of about 100k. Shortly after the close LULU announced they are acquiring fitness startup MIRROR. LULU is up 3% after-hours. Very cool and very legal \*inserts sunglasses emoji\*

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

805,Trading options as a retail trader is gambling.,,356,bz30dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bz30dg/trading_options_as_a_retail_trader_is_gambling/,1560199245.0,"Hi /r/options – longtime lurker, just wanted to express an opinion that I don’t see here often enough. It may be an unpopular opinion – and it’s probably been said here in some form before – but I think it needs to be said again. If you’re aware of it and choose to continue to trade options with a small % of your PNW then fine – this is more directed at those here who incorrectly believe that trading options in a retail account is a skillset that will save you from your day job, unfavorable life circumstances, or unhappiness. It’s not.



**Trading options as a retail trader is gambling**. In the long run the odds are strictly against you. If you’re okay with that and doing it within reason, then carry on. Just don’t quit your day job or blow your lunch money lining Ken Griffin’s (Citadel) pockets.



I was an options market maker for 3 years at a well-known Chicago prop shop, hired directly out of undergrad at a top school. Top 5 firm by volume for some major products (SPX), well-respected firm in the industry, etc. I was a clerk, then junior trader, then trader; I traded in the pit for 2 years and electronically (screens/clicking, mass-quoting, low-latency “eye”, etc) for 1 year. I say that to indicate that I have a good understanding of how these things trade – and I traded a lot of them. Our open positions – depending on the product – were in the tens or hundreds of thousands of contracts at any given time. (I left after saving some money to bootstrap my own company not in finance).



All of the 4-page “strategy” self-posts and “trade idea” mumbo jumbo in /r/options are bullshit. These are the meanderings of hobbyists – not serious market participants. Options are priced by the market to be mathematically as close to “fair value” as the best minds, models, and firms in the market can dictate.



So selling iron condors – while sexier than contributing regularly from your paycheck to VTI – does not give you an edge regardless of how well informed you think you are. Not only that, but because options expose you to risk factors other than directionality/delta (namely vol), they are an inefficient way to isolate an opinion on the market.



I’m not an efficient markets guy, per se, but the options market is ‘efficient’ enough that for all practical purposes, retail traders generally do not have an edge. Since retail traders are generally crossing the spread or being picked off, each trade you make stacks the odds slightly less in your favor – something akin to the house edge in a game of blackjack, where the market makers / large sophisticated market participants are the house.

Just wanted to put that down in writing. That is all – have a great week.

EDIT: to clarify a bit. Options and futures are a [zero-sum game](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-sumgame.asp). So for every winner there is a loser. So just at face value, if we say each participant has a 50% chance of winning, then the EV for each party is equal. However, if you shift the odds to be slightly in favor of the liquidity provider - say, 0.5% - then all of a sudden the 'maker' has an edge. Primarily, this edge is encapsulated in the spread, so each time you are crossing the spread, you're stacking the odds against yourself just a little bit. Retail traders lose in lots of little ways that ultimately stack the game against themselves: crossing the spread, inefficient or non-existent hedging, rebates given to volume participants, forced liquidations, amongst a host of other ways.

As a retail trader if you place a limit order it's the same thing, since in most cases the other side of the order is 'picking you off', i.e. trading against you somewhere else or just algorithmically determining that it's a good 'bet' to trade with you. Market makers are much better at this than retail traders, so this is primarily done by market makers.",options

ON and WY both had stellar days ending at 20.16, +6.22% and 23.42, +5% respectively. SU from yesterday also had a 10% increase. ZUO was the only one that did not participate in the rally, but still ended up green (mildly) at +.79%.

There are simple option formulas or approximations that would be useful to many. I hope to share and discover new ones by starting a crowd sourced post. If you know of an existing cheatsheet, that will be helpful too. They can be as simple as a single arithmetic operation, you never know! Ex. Some breakeven calculation. When would these be useful? When you vacation trade on an iPad! Off we go. Cheers!

\- approximate atm call,put price

    call_price = put_price
    = 0.4*S*vol*sqrt(T)
    = 0.021*S*vol*sqrt(D)
    
    price = in dollars
    S = underlying spot price
    vol = volatility in percent
    T = time in years
    D = time in days

\- approximate IV (sigma)

    iv = sqrt(2*pi/T) * C/S
    = 2.51/sqrt(T) * C/S
    = 48/sqrt(D) * C/S
    
    iv = volatility in percent
    T = time in years
    D = time in days
    C = option premium
    S = spot price

\- volatility to price change

    change_annual = sp*vol
    change_monthly = sp*vol/sqrt(12)
    = 0.29*sp*vol
    change_dte = sp*vol*sqrt(dte/365)
    = 0.05*sp*vol*sqrt(dte)
    
    sp = spot price
    vol = annualized volatility in percent
    change_* = price change in dollahs during time period

\- approximate time value remaining of option

    will share here after post has 10 or more rule of thumb formulas :)

Anyways, my tool displays the max pain strike price and the full open interest of calls/puts for any expiration.

If you like options, this is such a useful tool. Let's say you want to get on the TSLA hype and buy some short term calls. You enter the ticker symbol, select the date, and the option you want to buy. It'll tell you when you start making/losing money. For this one I selected a long call that expires 10/30 and is just barely under the stock price.

As you can see, the window for you to make money is very, very small. Different options have much bigger green areas, but this tells you that if you don't hit the prices (left) by the dates (top) that are in the green you will most likely lose your money. 

Options aren't bad, although they are a riskier. You just have to make a smart decision. Use this tool, click on the price/date you're shooting for and it will tell you how much you'll make if it hits by that date (obviously this is a snapshot in time, so numbers may get a little squishy if stock velocity changes)

Monday was difficult because most stocks on the list were up 4-5%. Here are my current positions and plan for each of them. It's important to have an idea of what you want to do with your positions. If you aren't comfortable holding something at it's current price point then its time to re-adjust your positions.

I had great gains Tuesday by market close, which got blasted yesterday, and up yet again today. Beauty of this all is by selling these puts I dont mind getting assigned, but I'm also collecting premium on theta while the market decides to play chop with itself.

# Positions

**CRM:** This was from last week's earnings YOLO. Looks like I will be assigned tomorrow around $221 level. My break-even price for the shares when I get assigned will be around $225. I can sell the $225 covered call next week and collect a decent premium, maybe 1%. I'm not worried about this position.

**DKNG**: From my plans this week DKNG was looking at a great target to sell puts at. Currently up 25%, I will close the position once it hits 60% profit.

**FROG**: Honestly, I don't know much about this company. I saw it dropped a decent amount from the highs recently so I sold some puts. This one is kind of a YOLO but premiums were incredible.

**PLTR**: Opened this position yesterday even though it wasn't on my list. It was down a good amount yesterday so I saw an opportunity to sell puts here and collect some premium.

**RKT**: This one has gone according to plan. $20 level is like a brick wall for this stock, I view selling puts around that level to be nearly free money (nothing is ever free). It's up a good amount here, I'll continue to hold to get a bit more out of it.

**SFIX**: This was my earnings YOLO this week and I hit smack on the nose. Stock soared 50% on earnings WTF.

**TDOC**: Teledoc is going to be a good long-term hold and something I will continue to sell puts against. Profit has been slow and steady on this one, but will close out around 60% profit.

* Previous battery days, such as in 2016, showed TSLA acquire SolarCity for 2.6 billion (with solar glass roofs), which have yet to be made
* The entire price of TSLA stock is up 428% this year alone

One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I’ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.

**FB – Facebook**

Facebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.

**MSFT – MicroTok**

Microsoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.

**SDC – Smile Direct Club**

Another unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week’s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.

**Snap – Snapchat**

Snap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it’s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There’s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I’m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.

**V – Visa**

Visa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it’s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit’s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it’s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.

828,The mistakes I've made in trading options - hope it's helpful,,341,kszhmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kszhmy/the_mistakes_ive_made_in_trading_options_hope_its/,1610099736.0,"Grateful for those who offered advice/help on Reddit whenever I needed it. Now just sharing my recent learnings to other who may find it helpful. I started options just towards end of last year.

My mistakes/lessons

* I started with a few contracts instead of just 1 for learning as a beginner. Should always start small just to understand how the system works, then scale slowly.
* I'm not quite aware of the effect of the greeks, hence I see prices moving quite dis-continously.
* I didn't have the right concept of how important time works, hence it's effect on a profitable trade. So far, I've lost all the trades whereby I could have easily won if I'm more careful with timing and greeks. My algo has been working very well directionally, if I manage to tame with time and greeks, I could have accelerated my earnings
* \[Added\] Don't buy cheap options (it's a trap)

In short, when moving into a new system, I used my experience from another system which is not useful to succeed. My advice to other newbies, it's ok the lose but start humble to learn about the system and the mechanisms, stay alive.

Hopefully I can report back how I have improved in the next update!",options

From a trading perspective, hedges and outright directional trades using long premium are more dollar cheap now and strategies that rely on short premium or ""selling the move"" are very dependent on realized volatility, or actual moves, being within much tighter ranges.

Imagine you're wheeling a promising stock. There's always a chance the stock blows up 40% in a month (happened to me with LTHM), and it might never drop back to the range where you were wheeling before.

Here's where these cheap LEAPS come in. At such low prices of 0.2% - 0.5% of strike price, a weekly 0.3-0.4 delta covered call or short put typically pays for one of these 90% OTM Call LEAPS with change to spare, and these are valid for another 15 months.

These options are found using [FDscanner](https://fdscanner.com/) (disclaimer I built it), with the scanner parameters

\- Expiry Jan 2022

\- % OTM: 85% - 99%

\- Option Price/Strike Price: 0-0.5%

\- Calls only

These LEAPS will give you the peace of mind that some upside is captured even on extreme upward movement. You could also set the scanner to find less OTM calls eg (45%-55%) at a higher cost, or find companies with cheap 50% OTM puts. Or increase the Option Price/Strike to a larger range (eg 0-2%) to find more companies.

Dozens more companies fit the criteria: BUD, KRE, BUD, T, MPLX, SCHW, though their option volume is just 1 - 5 for Friday. Possible the number might break 3 digits but is not captured on the scanner due to them having 0 volume for that day.

Alternatively, try to think of positive black swans for companies in the list. Eg a company trading at deep value, or is at cyclical lows, upcoming major product launches, pharma companies, etc.",options

841,Learnings from a Newer Options trader to other new options traders,,327,go6q9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/go6q9f/learnings_from_a_newer_options_trader_to_other/,1590099870.0,"After the past few months of effort, I felt compelled to share some learning that will have little value to many of you, but perhaps some meaning to a few, newer options traders. 

Ill preface this by saying that although I wasn't new to options trading, I left it a few years back because I had little success. With the drop back in April, I thought I would get back in with the focus being, have Patience and Wisdom.  

Here is what I have learned in my limited success thus far that I believe has value. Again, this will likely not apply to veterans or even intermediates, but newer people who want to have some success, take a lesson. 

Stay away from the Gambling. ie. lottery tickets. Although I am sure there is a place for it, I cant imagine how a person who is new to this and learning can buy straight calls and puts and get the timing and direction right, especially the cheap OTM ones. Yes you can get one right every so often and it feels great, makes you feel like you know what you are doing, and then you do another and loose it to decay or a directional issue.  Seems like gambling. 

NEVER REACT in FEAR of FRUSTRATION. For me, I made it a point to never trade in the first hour of the market opening.  My biggest issues a few years ago was reacting to quickly, especially in spreads, getting out to soon, or to late.  Have a plan to get in, and get out.  NEVER react due to that feeling in your stomach because you are afraid you will loose. 

Don't stare at the trading screen or app all day, this will make you question everything you are doing.  Again, for those experienced people who are day trading or have strategies that depend on this, that's different.  I'm talking to the new guys who are excited to get going. 

UNDERSTAND TIMING.  I will add in here that be very wary of any trades you have going around earnings.  I dont think the average options trader, buyers especially, understand time decay.  Add volatility into this and many times you will loose money even if  you get the direction right. 

Finally, For me at least, Selling is the way to go, especially early on.  Selling some puts on stocks that you really want to own with the idea of ultimately using the wheel seems the best way to make some money while you learn. Once I felt comfortable there, I allowed myself some spreads, never risking more than 2% on any trade.  Now, this may slow down some as the volatility drops, but there remain may ways to make 10-20% off a trade with minimal risk.  Get enough of those, and you are getting somewhere. 

No, i wont be a millionaire over night, but i assure you i wont go broke either. 

Beyond that, well, I haven't gotten there yet, not comfortably. Since mid March I am up 120% on a $5K start.  I am not bragging whatsoever, I share that simply to say that being patience, wise, and willing to take small gains and minimize risk, I believe this can work out. 

Thanks for letting me get my thoughts out there, hope it had some value to at least one person.",options

I used to be a swing trader, trading mostly biotech. I turned 50K into $150K and then pretty much lost it all on a company which went bust.

Then a few years, I decided to start with options trading. Initially having a few lucky hits, with options I lost another 50K. 

In 2020 I decided to give it another try. I definitely learned more about technical analysis, managing risk, quick scalps, cashing profits to the bank ASAP, etc. I did a $10K options account challenge and within 4 months I made $100K on scalps with monthly/weekly options.

**AMD – Advanced Micro Devices**

AMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There’s been an uptick in the semi’s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.

**DKNG – DraftKings**

Draftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.

**KO – Coca Cola**

Big call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn’t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.

**INTC – Intel Corporation**

I caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It’s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.

**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**

Didn’t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven’t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We’ll find out this week.

Next week I'll go in detail on how to incorporate different strategies into your trading.

**RCII – Rent-A-Center**

Spotted some unusual option flow in Rent-A-Center in December 18 CALLs. Player purchased 1,500 CALLs at the $40 strike (33% OTM), stock currently $29.00. Bet size was about $85k and the player is expecting a huge jump in stock price by the end of the year. RCII reports earnings next week August 5th. The strike price was the highest strike price currently available on the option chain and the volume of that trade was about 33% of total open interest for every single option chain available for that stock.

**HSBC – HSBC Holdings**

HSBC saw some bullish flow with next week’s expiring (Aug 7) calls. A player purchased over 8,000 CALLs at the $23 strike for a premium of $365k. Pretty big bet for a position expiring next week. Of note, HSBC is currently near 52-week low and they report earnings Monday.

**WORK – Slack Technologies**

I saw some bullish flow roll through WORK last week. Most of it was PUT selling with an expiration in the fall or next year. There was also one interesting position opened that was interesting. A player opened a synthetic long position, which is similar risk to buying shares outright. The play was: 1. Bought to open 15,000 Sept-18 CALLs at $30 strike and 2. Sold to open 15,000 Sept-18 PUTs at $30 strike. Essentially they collect $1.3 million in premium to go long on the stock as long as it stays above $30 by September 18. If the stock closes below $30 they will be assigned over 1,500,000 shares. Of course, they can sell anytime before then, but they are pretty bullish on the stock with this position. Of note, Slack has been hammered in recent weeks due to the increase of competition to their main platform.

**MS & JPM – Morgan Stanley & JPM**

I’ll categorize these two guys together. Banks have been getting the smack-down over the last several months. Most saw a bit of uptick in call activity coming through last week. Nothing spectacular here, but good to notice an increase in bullish flow as we have recently been starting to see some rotation out of tech. Banks could be due for some positive news, most are near the lows.

**VXX – VIX Short-Term Futures**

Following up from last week, players are still betting on a decrease in volatility for the short-term after next week. Analyzing some of the plays, it looks like players are expecting the VXX stay in the range between $23 and $27, $currently $29. VXX going down means volatility dropping, which typically is bullish for the market.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this article you will learn about LEAP options, how to use them, and some important details to understand about the LEAP strategy.

## What is a LEAP?

LEAP is short for “Long Term Equity Anticipation Security” (quite a mouthful), and is also a popular options strategy.

That acronym may have sounded confusing, so I’ll break it down for you. A LEAP is an options strategy that is used when you believe in a stocks growth in the long term.

In options-trading, a LEAP is when you **buy a long-dated option (think 1–2 years till expiration),** although the minimum is 7 months till expiration to be classified as a LEAP.

Because you have an expected long-term outcome for the stock, the option will be cheaper than buying 100 shares of the same stock.

We will go through the pro’s and con’s of LEAPS after this example.

## LEAP Example

This example will explain the in’s and out’s of LEAP’s.

>I am bullish on SPY (S&P 500 Index Fund),  and think that it will go well past $370 by March 2022. 

Although I could buy 100 shares of SPY for \~$33k, I choose to buy a LEAP Call. 

>I buy the SPY 3/18/22 $335 Call for $35

Before I go any further, here is a profit-graph of LEAP’s:

&#x200B;

[Long Call Profit Graph](https://preview.redd.it/axhgjmoss0m51.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27600d7e966aeda2b96595e22c017cb19a4ffec)

As you can see, a LEAP is simply a long call, with far expirations. In my case, I paid $3500 for a SPY Call, expiring in March of 2022. 

My break even price is calculated by: *Strike + Premium Paid = Break Even*In my example, **my SPY call break’s even at $370.**

## Potential Outcomes:

By the time of expiration, or by 1 DTE, if:

**SPY closes at $380:** We make $1000 profit on our call. The intrinsic value of the call can be calculated by: 100 x (SPY close — Call Strike) = Intrinsic Value. In our example, our call is $10 ITM, times 100 shares per contract.

**SPY closes at $370:** Although very rare, in this case, we break even on our call. The premium we paid nets out our Call’s intrinsic value.

**SPY closes below $370:** In this case, we lose our entire $3.5k principal, as our option is worthless.

## Downsides of LEAP’s

**Theta Decay** — As with all options, time decay is a serious downside to opening LEAP contracts.

**Timing** — For all we know, your stock that you choose could moon the day after expiration, while your contract expired worthless.

## Leverage

As with all options contracts, each contract will control 100 shares. In our example, we would be able to buy almost 10 LEAP’s compared to buying 100 shares.

The problem with this is that if your options expire worthless, you have lost all of your money. 

Even if the stock went down or traded sideways, if you had invested into shares, you would still have some money left.

For this reason, only buy the amount of contracts in which you would actually have bought the stocks.

## Don’t Sweat It

You may see your stock bouncing up and down, or get worried about your investment. 

It is important to remember and always fix yourself for the long-term. Will your stock rebound? If so, then don’t close for a loss.

**Thanks for reading another writeup, and if you are interested, here are my other options strategies that I have written about:**

* [Debit Spreads](https://medium.com/@ProjectTheta/how-to-options-debit-spreads-38b03d5b41ad)

&#x200B;

EDIT: I was asked to put this into the article, as an explainer for some confusion:

1. Break even, max profit, and max loss values ONLY APPLY AT EXPIRATION. You can only gain the full premium, or reach your max loss potential if you hold your contracts till expiration. Many people prefer to close out of contracts in a specified amount of time, like 1 month, or 30dte.
2. Max profit comes with max risk and max holding time, so please, CLOSE YOUR POSITIONS BEFORE EXPIRATION.

I felt like it has been updated enough to justify another post. I will admit that I started off in WSB and have been trying to improve my knowledge and understanding. The document is safe for work. The only part may be the glossary at the very end. 

I hope this helps people just starting out. Those who are using Robinhood mainly. It has visuals and other other things to help you understand what you are dealing with. Have a great week. Make good trades and remember profit is profit. You don’t need 10 baggers. Win consistently and you can trade for a while.

There are so many to choose from.  If you're a newer user to TOS, and you want a place to start from, here is a scanner that I setup finally with a lot of cross-referencing users here on /r/options as well as online scanners.

http://tos.mx/bu49zwc

Edit: I updated the scan to remove the duplicate Open Interest filter - thankfully, I'm not giving investment advice :D

Clicking the link should just open TOS to the scan with the values populated.  If you don't have TOS installed and click, I'm not quite sure what will happen :)

This particular scan is looking for options plays where I can *sell a PUT* and collect decent premium.  I'm using a list of tickers that I watch to scan against, so it's not just scanning the entire stock market (which you can do if you'd like very easily), but on a group of about 100 tickers I'm narrowing in on 43 possibilities as of this morning that fit the criteria I'm looking for.

I'm sharing this as you'll have a variety of sliders where you can play with one or two at a time and see how the results change - this is the ""hands-on"" that ultimately helped me understand the scanner better, and if you're paying for a scanner, you might find that you have the ability to get the results that you want even more fine-tuned, so long as you have Think Or Swim.

I've experience selling puts and calls but have not been one to purchase options. So I decided to give my first go just doing 1 simple leap in my tIRA and see how it plays out. Thought I would share:

&nbsp;


AMD Stock Price (at time of post): $92.70  
Account: Traditional IRA  
Option: CALL ADVANCED MICRO DEVI $60 EXP 01/21/22  
Contracts: 1  
Price: $38.20

Delta: ~0.90  
Intrinsic Value: $32.70 ($3,270.00)  
Extrinsic Value: $5.50 ($550.00)  

&nbsp;

  
Exit Strategy: Best scenario for me is 50% profit; I've an open order to 'Sell to Close' at $57.30. Potentially use proceeds to purchase more AMD LEAPS at same expiration but deeper ITM strike. Will reevaluate decision if sold. Regardless of profit/loss, I will exit 30 days before expiration.   

&nbsp;


Rationale/Bias: I am bullish on AMD and have been for a while. I hold most of my shares in the $55-$60 range in my brokerage account. AMD is my 2nd most holding after Microsoft. I believe that AMD microchips are superior to Intel chips and they've been gaining marketspace for a while and will continue to do so. New business partnerships and continued growth in the 5G boom will also give AMD more business growth. Additionally, I am overall positive about the market next year as the Fed keeps ""printing money"" and keeping interest rates low so AMD should benefit from that push. Lastly, once AMD reaches $100 stock price, I believe support will be there to hold that position. Bullish sentiment appears everywhere with AMD: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-chip-stocks-more-100-154303385.html  I'm obviously biased but if anyone had bear reasons for AMD, I'd be interested to hear them. Thanks!

&nbsp;

Edit: I made a few additions for FYI. I added the delta, intrinsic value, and extrinsic value. Thanks for comments in this thread. The PMCC is interesting but my brokerage doesn't allow me to sell naked but would I could do is sell far OTM covered calls on my AMD stock in my brokerage on a monthly basis; perhaps enough to even pay off the extrinsic value of this LEAP in my IRA.",options

If you entered this morning you likely got these shares at a discount. I entered after hours near the close of the day on each of these so I am currently at a loss. EVRI I have decided to shift into a medium term hold with a TP of about $10 and a SL around 6. There was significant volume at the Jun 19 ’20 10C and 12.5C today. FTCH still had some Jun 19’20 16C volume of 3.43k and an OI of 8.43k. I will check tomorrow morning for the OI change. If the volume today represents investors exiting their calls I too will likely exit the position in the AM. If the stock and OI increases I will likely hold through the day and look for movement. Their investor Conference is June 11th (mentioned in last post). Stop loss is around 14.50 on this trade.

We’ll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

&#x200B;

**USFD - US Foods Holding Group**

https://preview.redd.it/giioup9t1t061.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c3c2335776dd8c2880c6839c80109116e243c8

Some unusual option flow has surfaced in USFD, an unusual ticker to begin with that doesn't generally have much option volume roll through it. Last week we saw some call buying for December 18 expiration at the $35 strike. The stock has been consolidating for some time based on the chart, is it time for a break-out?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LB - L Brands Inc**

https://preview.redd.it/5vr4fgxt1t061.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de6cb0535000ba8c7a1e50fd82bf5f7e319a535

LB shot up last week and saw some heavy bullish option flow come through the tape. Big time call-buying for 2021 expirations, so somewhat mid-term plays here. LB posted good earnings last week and looks like players are looking to ride the momentum to new highs. The stock is up about 20% just last week.

&#x200B;

**TEAM - Atlassian Corp**

https://preview.redd.it/t91i1mgu1t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5a165c2df9531c6bddd71022d3b55db750cc44e

Absolutely huge call-buying in 2021 expirations and some 2022 LEAPs. Most strikes were somewhat in-the-money indicating the options contract will act more closely to share price and less of a YOLO. Nonetheless we saw some multi-million dollar positions come through betting that the stock will out-perform in the 6 months to 1 year. Interesting plays here.

&#x200B;

**RTX - Raytheon Tech**

https://preview.redd.it/b04laqz12t061.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=06db43eecfbe6499f7581bf2c5f13200780b9ae4

Another unusual ticker to be receiving such heavy call volume hit the tape. Last week a player bought 16,000 call options expiring in June 2021. The strike price was 20% OTM at the time, this is a pretty FKn big YOLO. I will be following this stock to see what catalysts might come out.

&#x200B;

**YETI - Yeti Holdings**

https://preview.redd.it/nyikkkt22t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43990ee4c4b492c4061daa13ed3c7fcafdaa491

Some put-selling came through YETI ticker last week. Multiple positions which included a position of 8k contracts puts SOLD to open. The stock has been on a steady up-trend ever since covid and the player is expecting the trend to continue into the Holiday season. 8,000 puts sold at $50 strike for December 4 expiration. If the stock stay above $50 (currently at $61), the player will collect $450k in premium.

&#x200B;

**FANG - DiamondBack Energy**

https://preview.redd.it/yu1zqww32t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=724a51fe870d4adc7768bd02f5ebc45f9faba374

This energy stonk has been beat up since covid hit and hasn't rebounded at all. Looking at the chart it's been in the $25-40 range for 6 months without much growth. Some call buying with mid-term time-frames came through last week in Dec 18 and Mar 19, 2021 expirations. Each play was between 3-5k contract a piece and the $45 strike was the favorite here which is sitting at about 15% OTM. This name has seen some heavy buying into since November and will be interesting to watch.

&#x200B;

**HALO - Halozyme Therapeutics**

https://preview.redd.it/tnoywxd42t061.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=19254d3525347e7507a6fab88b10e6d51af80de5

Halo has shot up 50% just in the last month of trading and has seen some explosive growth.  A ticker that rarely sees even a few hundred contracts come through saw a couple plays in the 1,000s of contracts last week. This is pretty unusual considering the open interest for most strikes and expirations is less than 80-100 per strike. So these plays of over 1,000 contract definitely stand out. Looks like players are betting on the stock to go above $44 by December 18, 2020, a relatively short-term play that would make WSB proud.

&#x200B;

**GE - General Electric**

https://preview.redd.it/p210ui752t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec919f5bea611428d6e5dacea856caa4a77e74e

Last week unusual call buying swept through. With nearly all the plays expiring mid-2021. An absolutely amazing 100k call contracts were traded at the June 18, 2021 expiration and $10 strike. Also looks like 100k put contracts were traded on the Jan 15, 2021 contracts with $8 strike. Tough to say if these plays are related with the same player. Most of the option flow outside those two big plays was leaning to the bullish side.",options

This week has been pretty tough to swallow, being down the amount I am. I initially bought the leaps to give me plenty of time to recoup, but obviously with such a volatile stock, I have nightmares of PLTR going back to the teens.

866,Using Debit Spreads to Lock in Profits and Avoid PDT on Options That Are Immediately Profitable,,302,hddv4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hddv4f/using_debit_spreads_to_lock_in_profits_and_avoid/,1592771184.0,"We've all been there. You buy a call or put and the stock just climbs or bleeds all day. It hits all your profit and trim targets but you don't want to waste a day trade to lock in profits so you hold overnight and the next day the stock gaps against you wiping out all your profits. You spend the day cursing the FINRA for arbitrary rules that hold the little man down and regret not taking the day trade. But worry not, there is a solution: debit spreads!

**What is Debit Spread**

First things first, understanding a debit spread a prerequisite. To execute a debit spread you purchase a closer ITM strike and you sell a further out of the money strike. If the stock price rises and breaks through your short strike then you would execute your long strike to cover for a net gain. Since your long strike is closer ITM than your short strike it is always going to cost more than, meaning you open this spread for a net debit.

Let's walk through an example with calls.  Say we're bullish on SPY which is currently trading at 309.10 and we have a price target of 315 by the end of the week. To perform a debit spread we're going to buy the 310 strike for 2.96 and sell the 315 strike for a credit of 1.24. The net debit in this scenario is 2.956 - 1.24 = 1.716. Now if spy closes above 315 we'll be obligated to sell 100 shares at 315 so we will use our long call (which gives us the right to buy 100 shares at 310) to cover it. Our net profit is 500 - 171 = 329. However, if our stock did not go in our favor and instead went down to 300$ then both of our options would expire worthless and our max loss would be the debit we paid to open the spread: 1.716.

This can also be done with puts. You would want to buy the higher strike and sell the lower strike. E.G Buy the 300$ put and sell the 295$ put, you would be obligated to buy 100 shares at 295, but you would have the right to sell them at 300.

**How We Can Use This Concept As Swing Traders**

Debit Spreads are commonly used to lower the risk but cap the gains when going long an option. But as swing traders who are already long an option, this is a useful tool to have in our toolbox.  Instead of opening a spread from the get-go, we can open a spread when we're ready to take profits.

Let's look at an example. We're long a SPY 310 call that we got in when SPY was at 309 for 2.96 and SPY is currently trading at 315. This means that our call is worth about 6.49. Now we have to decide if we want to use a day trade to take profits and let's assume that we don't want to or don't have any left. In order to lock in some of our profits, we're going to sell the 315 strike for the same expiration date as our long call 310 call. We will sell this call for about 3.45. Now let's analyze our position. We are obligated to sell 100 shares at 315 if SPY ends the week above 315, but we have the right to buy 100 shares at 310 meaning we will make 500$ + 345$ - 296$ = 549$. If however, SPY doesn't end the week above 315 and moves strongly against us and ends at 305$ we would be guaranteed the 345 - 296 = 49$ net profit we gained converting our position. If we had just held the call our max loss would be the full 296$, but by converting our position into a call debit spread we guaranteed that his play would be a winner.

Obviously this can be done with puts as well

**The Down Side**

Converting your position to a debit spread locks in profit but is also limits your gains. In our earlier example if SPY were to continue to moon then the max profit would still be 549$ while if you had just held your call you would have unlimited potential for gains. Because of this, some people like to only convert some of their position to achieve break-even and let the rest ride. (E.G if each debit spread netted a guaranteed profit of 100$ and you were in 10 contracts at 50$ each then you would convert 5 of our long contracts to debit spreads netting you 500$ and guaranteeing a break-even and let the other 5 contracts ride.)

Something else to be aware of is if the stock expires between the strikes then most brokers will require you to have the funds to purchase the stock. If you don't want to buy the stock or don't have the funds to buy the stock then you should sell the debit spread before expiration (you won't get the full intrinsic value of the spread, but it will be very close) For this reason I tend to close my spreads for slightly less than the intrinsic value before expiration in case there is AH movement.

This is not Financial Advice

All option prices are calculated using a Black Scholes model adjusted for dividends.

Everything I mentioned can be done with puts as well as calls.

If you have questions or opinions feel free to ask in the comments. I will try and respond to everyone I can.

**TLDR**: Lock in your profits with debit spreads, but limit your gains.

867,Some back testing on selling puts,,295,kme1rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kme1rh/some_back_testing_on_selling_puts/,1609247136.0,"Since I'm having a few days off and we're in a lockdown I decided to do some simple research on put option selling. I've been selling options for over a year now and was really curious how my strategy would have performed over the past years.

I tested a few strategies on selling puts: Selling a weekly put on Monday open and buying it back on Friday close. Strike prices ranging from 5% Out of the money to 5% In the money including a closest At the money strategy possible. The puts are sold on the $SPY ETF which also functions as the underlying for this. Start amount was $1,000,000 and I allowed it to sell fractional puts (I know this is not realistic) which allows for a better comparison.

I got the data of the put options from OptionMetrics and the data of the underlying from Thomson Reuters Eikon. Which are databases top researches use as well so I believe the data quality is good.

From 01-01-2011 until 01-01-2020 this would have resulted in the following performance for each strategy:

[Graph 1: performance of each strategy.](https://preview.redd.it/kp3qzi94k4861.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf8c9dd98d87f10d8e7e034d25dd823e8406923)

Remarkably not any strategy was able to outperform the SPY ETF over the period of 9 years. something that is also worth mentioning: up until September 2016 some ITM strategies were able to sometimes be above the underlying, but after September 2016 seem to stay behind. After looking in to this it turned out that CBOE introduced (by-)daily options on the SPY ETF around that time, so first I though I made a mistake and that the strategies started selling the (by-)daily options instead of the weekly's, I checked this multiple times but it turned out not to be it.

From this I went one step further and calculated the returns, after which I deducted the risk free rate to get excess returns for each strategy, which are the following:

[Graph 2: annualized excess returns.](https://preview.redd.it/yrefcew6k4861.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a56bb7b4a4b08ddcd47b6c10b171833431943d)

The returns look as expected when looking at graph 1. So for the next step I took a look at the volatility of each returns, which look the following:

[Graph 3: annualized volatility of excess return.](https://preview.redd.it/p9azv959k4861.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d12a2a36b90a1547f246032f04d3ca01cf97327)

The volatility graph and the excess return graph look pretty much the same so we need some ratio to compare the strategies with each other and with the underlying. I choose to use Sharpe's ratio, which essentially measures the excess return for each unit of volatility (the higher the ratio the better).

[Graph 4: Sharpe's ratio for each strategy.](https://preview.redd.it/oflgb3q1w5861.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc48a566eaf79653946286ccac969c9e5606b4fb)

Looking at the graph above it states that some put selling strategies have a better volatility/excess return ratio aka risk/return trade-off than actually owning the underlying. Especially the OTM strategies. The downside is that it would require quite some leverage to equal the same risk (volatility) as the underlying in order to get more return for the same amount of risk.

The strategy is used is very simplistic (sell-to-open on Monday, buy-to-close on Friday). I don't yet draw any conclusion from this, other than that some put selling strategies could generate a better risk/return trade-off than owning the underlying, but if you don't allow leverage(margin) the actual excess return on that strategy is less than the excess return on owning the underlying. I plan on making the strategy more advanced in order to get a better look at the strategy.

869,"Gamma effect in story stocks, Gamestop, Tesla etc. etc.",,296,l42c3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l42c3u/gamma_effect_in_story_stocks_gamestop_tesla_etc/,1611505197.0,"On Friday I wrote here about a pretty wild example of the short gamma effect on Gamestop [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l2u65m/gamestop_options_gamma_above_60/). If you've been following me on here it's something I've been harping on for the last 6-9 months. I got a lot of questions on that post and wanted to go into a bit more detail about what it all means and what comes next.

Refresher TLDR: A ton of retail flow is buying upside calls in high flying stocks and that creates short gamma for the sell side/ market makers. As the stocks go higher more and more stock needs to be bought to cover for the increasing short deltas created by that short gamma.

GME was a hilarious example on Friday as it ran out of strikes on Friday's expiration and the MM's had essentially covered their short gamma for that day and the stock topped out and pulled back after that happened. Obviously, there are a ton of other factors, and the biggest in GME is all the short stock, creating a short squeeze. But the gamma is the most important/interesting one from an options perspective. In fact, gamma becoming a focus of options traders is one of the cooler developments I've seen over the past few months as it's a much more important factor (IMHO) than things I don't put a lot of stock in like unusual activity, for example. (unusual activity is really difficult to unpack and it suffers from a massive survivorship bias, whereas short gamma creates a real market inefficiency, imo)

The main question I've been getting is what's next and when does this all end. The unsatisfying answer is no one knows when it ends including me. There are so many unique factors creating the current environment, the pandemic, the fed, WSB, Robinhood, stimulus checks, you name it. But I can tell you that this is just the latest example of something that happens every decade or so and it does end... but that's not a bad thing. It just means that when it does, traders need to be able to adjust.

The way this current environment ends is when the market goes sideways or down for an extended period of time and all those OTM calls start to expire worthless. A bunch of those new traders will disappear, but many will stick around and adjust.

And traders don't necessarily need to wait for that moment. The mania for upside calls is creating tons of opportunity for those willing to sacrifice a little upside now for staying power. Here's an example, using Tesla options for this week and showing a 850/900 debit call spread via Options AI (I am neither bullish nor nearish in TSLA earnings, just using this as an example):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fa2mv9cg1bd61.gif

This is an 850/900 debit call spread, costs about $18. The amazing thing about this spread is it is selling the 900 call at $16. Those 900 calls are PUMPED, and a 50 wide spread with a breakeven of $868 is trading almost the exact same price as a 900 call outright, with a breakeven of $916. You can see the strikes here:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b1zt0buy1bd61.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3df877e1d0479d342cb081aebaeebcf3ea4fc6

&#x200B;

Of course, the upside is capped, but that is a massive difference in probability and is the type of trading that has staying power. And that's not even mentioning credit spreads, which have even higher probability of profit. This is the next conversation to be had in options for traders new on the scene. Of course there's nothing wrong with upside calls at the moment. I have no qualms about people doing what works, at any point. But it is important to also know what is more sustainable after the gamma runs dry.

I posted last Sunday in [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/) my [plays for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jqlhvn/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_made_4k/) and updated the thread Monday morning when I entered the position. Last week I netted about $1,500 on $80,000 or roughly 2%. Not bad considering most stonks ended lower for the week and a few of my positions were looking at risk of being assigned. [The week prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) I netted $4k on $75,000 or 5% return.

Please refrain from any comments such as ""only 1% per week dude you suck"". 1% per week will double your account in about 80 week. So yes that's all I aim for.

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**BABA**: 1x CSP $260 strike 20 Nov expiration, 1x CSP $245 strike Nov 20 expiration.

I opened the $260 strike put last week when the stock dipped, then opened the $245 strike put on Friday after the stock dipped for a second time. The $260 was down about 25% when I opened the $245 and I saw it as free money to get me back to at very minimum break-even on this particular ticker by this upcoming Friday the 20th. These 2 CSPs are taking up a fuckload of my buying power, so I will need to close them if I want to open up additional positions because I don't like being over-leveraged. If BABA gets a pop on Monday, I'll close out one or both and free up some capital if I want to enter new positions.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**LULU - 4 week earnings run-up play**

LULU has been trading in the same range for the last 5 months unable to hold the break-out, but not falling below support either. I'm feeling comfortable owning this stock around $310 range and expecting a potential run-up into earnings set to report mid December. I will look to sell Dec 18 puts to collect on earnings IV and see a potentially pump in the next few weeks. These will be about 4-5 weeks out, so I'll even sell closer to an at-the-money strike and hopefully find a good return. LULU IV isn't the best and the stock price will require a lot of buying power so I will keep an eye on some opportunities this week instead of jumping right into the play Monday AM.

**Positions I'm looking at**:

Dec 18 $300 strike put for $9.50 or $950 in premium, 3.17% return in 5 weeks

**OR**

Dec 18 $310 strike put for $12.50 or $1,250 in premium, 4.0% return in 5 weeks

**DOCU - Earnings December 3rd**

https://preview.redd.it/py6frev5yhz51.png?width=2434&format=png&auto=webp&s=b547e7f2b24e661e5e1e1b069b4a915344faad7f

I made some money on DOCU 2 weeks ago. Last week stock price was crushed by vaccine news which turned out to be nothing but fluff. We can see DOCU is once again trading at the lower range of the trend/channel (pink lines). The trend is still up, but the stock price has been highly volatile failing each break-out and returning into the channel. I like selling $195 or even $200 strike puts if I can. All depends how we open Monday. DOCU is set to report earnings December 3rd.

**Positions I'm looking at:**

Dec 4 $200 strike put for $11.00 or $1,100 premium, a return of 5.5% in 3 weeks

&#x200B;

**AMD - A spin-off from NVDA earnings.**

https://preview.redd.it/z39ri90cyhz51.png?width=2304&format=png&auto=webp&s=43185021db634a624327cadaae0792e097e98b83

I made some good money selling puts on AMD back in June/July when the stock was trading completely flat for 2 months. The price action from May-August is very similar to what it's doing now, just at lower stock price back then. Looks like it's been in a similar range for the last few weeks. NVDA options are quite expensive, so I'll be using AMD as a proxy and playing that. Looking at the fancy crayola support/resistance lines I drew I think there will be buyers if we get down to $78 or $74. I'm comfortable **HODL**ing AMD at those levels and run the wheel if I need to. In my opinion, we can see a bullish bounce from NVDA earnings. If you have the capital and want to sell against NVDA I think there is a similar play that can be found there.

**Positions:**

AMD Nov 27 $78 strike puts for $1.10, a return of 1.4% in 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

**TDOC - TELEDOC**

https://preview.redd.it/nr8v2rbdyhz51.png?width=2300&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5d4f41ae7c40013b0a00df854479fca014b6577

TDOC is a newly added ticker to my watchlist and I think will have good potential in the future. You might be seeing me enter this trade quite a few times in the next weeks. The TDOC chart has been highly volatile recently. I wouldn't say technicals don't matter, but it's quite possible this stock just blows past any support/resistance with ease. The stock has had a pretty good dip in last week's trading sessions and trading down 30% from the August highs. I'm comfortable selling the $175 strike put and owning the stock at that price if it continues to dip.

**Positions:**

Nov 27 $175 put for $4.30, or 2.5% return in 2 weeks.

A lot depends how we open Monday, if market has a melt-up we simply wait until entry points become favorable to us. That might not be until later in the week, but patience is always key in the stonk market. If we open down then we can sell the positions mentioned at 1 or 2 strikes lower for the same premium, that's a win-win. Don't forget we have a monthly options expiration this week and it could be volatile.

&#x200B;

Hope y'all had a good weekend, **lets get this bread**.

**10am UPDATE:**

Closed 1 of my BABA CSP's for a 15% gain, will let the other ride to expiration or close at 90% to free up capital if I want another play.

At the market open everything was moving fast. Wish I got in when everything was pretty red, but it climbed quick shortly after open. Entered only 2 positions so far, AMD + TDOC, I think I will add DOCU in there as well. I'm still liking most plays on my list, but going to sit tight for now. Lots of opportunities out there. Good luck all! Will post another update

There are people who are about to lose several billion dollars to retail. American royalty, the type of people who don't lose. To us peasants. A setup like this has never happened before and most likely there will be regulatory changes that make it impossible to ever happen again.  


In a situation like this, rules go out the window. These people are not going to just accept this. There is a good chance that we see trading halted on GME at a critical point around options expiration, most likely either this week or next. In the event that trading is halted as your options expire, you are locked in to them and you have to choose at the expiration point whether or not you want to execute. We all know the average retail trader who bought GME options does not have the balance to do that. The market makers will keep the premium and retail gets left holding the bag.

SABR was quite a bit higher in the morning at 11.50 but proceeded to drop for the rest of the day ending at -1%. If you had a reasonable take profit that should have hit. The second pick, APA, ended up 9.77%.

**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY –**

Summary : Friday’s picks HPE and BHC ended up pretty well today. Keep in mind, both of these stocks have conferences coming up. BHC has the Goldman Sachs 41st Annual Virtual Global Healthcare Conference June 10th and HPE has the conference tomorrow. Keep this in mind if you held through today. Buying the rumor and selling the news is usually a safe bet.

Regarding the momentum stocks, EVRI and FTCH look solid to me. With the recent run up of gambling stocks EVRI seems all around solid for a shorter-term hold. I bought both EVRI and FTCH in after hours. As for the Classic UOA stocks, I’m not playing either of these but will likely do a call spread on TSLA tomorrow.

874,Trading the other side of TSLA S&P addition,,297,jw6mel,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jw6mel/trading_the_other_side_of_tsla_sp_addition/,1605663985.0,"The big day is here, Elon has delivered. TSLA is finally entering the S&P 500. That means 422b of new market cap, the biggest company ever to be added to the S&P. On the other hand, we will likely see one or more tickers removed from the index which could mean short term underperformance. This trade revolves around **shorting names that could be booted from the S&P because of Tesla.** 

The bottom 10 stocks in the S&P by market cap (likely to be removed) are currently ([https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500))

* Xerox (XRX)
* Apache Corporation (APA)
* SL Green Realty (SLG)
* Ralph Lauren (RL)
* Vontier (VNT)
* Discovery Inc. Class A (DISCA)
* HollyFrontier (HFC)
* TechnipFMC (FTI)
* UAA (Under Armour Class A) (UAA)
* UA (Under Armour Class C) (UA)
* News Corporation Class B (NWS)

Out of the 10 companies removed from the S&P this year, 2 have been in oil and gas (Helmerich and Payne, Cimarex Energy), and 5 have been retail/consumer facing (Kohls, Coty, Nordstrom, Capri Holdings, Macy’s). 

If we look at companies in the bottom of the S&P which fit this profile, a few stick out (excluding UA due to the share class structure): 

* Apache (APA) (Oil/Gas)
* Ralph Lauren (RL) (Consumer/Retail)
* HollyFrontier (HFC) (Oil/Gas)
* TechnipFMC (FTI) (Oil/Gas)

These are four companies that seem to have a reasonable chance of being excluded, and subsequently underperforming. I’m taking cheap bear call spreads on each that will net a payout initially, and hold up if one or more of the companies are excluded from the S&P

The VIX closed the past week below 21, for the second week in a row, matching the lowest implied volatility across the market since the March sell-off. The lower level of implied volatility means compressed expected moves across the major indices.

This email support has a wait time of 1-3 business days, that is atrocious. I began to receive notifications on my phone that my shares and contracts were being sold on RH (even though I was logged out of the account). I ran to the nearest ATM to check the balance of my RH debit card - the money was still on the card and had not been transferred out yet. I withdrew $500 which is apparently the max daily limit. I still have over $600 sitting in my RH that I cannot touch. I posted this on the Robinhood subreddit but it was quickly deleted. I followed all rules and guidelines.

883,Selling Puts for Income,,292,cam4e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/cam4e1/selling_puts_for_income/,1562598034.0,"I've been selling puts for income for about 5 years now. I'd say about 75% of the puts I sell expire worthless, allowing me to pocket the entire premium. The other 25% of the time I get put the stock. In these cases I usually immediately sell a call at the same strike price, which puts more cash in my pocket. If the stock drops significantly below the strike price and leaves me sitting on a potential loss, I usually just wait  for a bounce before selling a new call. 

My basic rule is to pick stocks that I don't mind owning at the price. These are usually time tested companies with proven track records, steady dividend payers, and would be regarded as boring by most standards. Example companies are AAPL, MCD, AXP, PFE, CSCO, INTC, etc... 

I aim to make about 15% per year with this strategy, and have been successful at doing this for the past few years. I scan through maybe 30 stocks each week, and look for the 1-2 that are trading near support levels. I then sell a put that expires in 30-45 days. I choose a strike that gives me a small cushion on the downside, and generates my 15% return. 

To calculate the return, I assume the entire amount of capital needed to buy the stock is set aside. So if I'm selling a put at a $45 strike price, I make sure I have the $4500 in my account to buy the 100 shares, should that be necessary. I know some people calculate an annual percentage based on margin, but I've never been a margin trader before. I always make sure to have all the cash on hand to meet any purchase obligations. 

My goal here is just to start publishing my trades and establishing a track record. I don't trade every week, but I do enter at least 1-2 trades per month. When the market over-reacts to the downside, I will sometimes enter multiple trades in order to capitalize on the increased fear, as put premiums skyrocket in these cases. 

At most I like to have 8 positions open at a time. Anything beyond that and I'm typically maxed out in terms of available cash. Feel free to ask questions on any trades I post, or follow along if you'd like.

I started out with $12k in March, and now I have $1.5k. How did I get to this point? Well, I got sucked into the mindset that everything is absolutely fucked and got fingerblasted by one put option after another. As the stock market rallied in April, I remained skeptical and deluded myself into thinking that the rug pull was going to happen at any moment. Then, most recently, I let the desperation get to my head. When my trades were profitable, I waited to cash out, thinking I could recoup more of my losses if I held. Those profits quickly turned into losses. In other cases, I would make a play, watch it go south, and exit for a loss when I could have made some hefty gains had I just held. It was one misstep after the next. Then I heard about these oil tankers. I got sucked into the hype, thinking this could be the play that would get me out of this gigantic hole I dug for myself. I got calls on NAT, DHT, EURN, and STNG. For a short time, I was up by 20 to 50%. Again, I held too long, and they all drilled. I could have exited at a substantial but manageable loss, but I believed that as earnings approached, they'd swing upwards again. Needless to say, I was wrong. Oil climbed back up, tankers plummeted even further, and earnings did jackshit for their stock prices. Oh yeah, can't forget about unusual option activity - got fucked by that as well. And here I am.

I'd like to say I learned my lessons, that I'm better at managing my risk and my emotions, but is it enough to make the climb back up from $1.5k? I'm not so sure. I could use your advice on how to proceed. If you've been in this situation before and managed to recoup your losses, I'll take whatever pointers you can give.

This is obviously only covering a small portion of the trade universe but I thought it would be helpful to those a little overwhelmed with the choice within an options chain.

The key here is keeping things simple. Knowing what a trade is expressing and how that applies to what you think/hope will happen. That main point is not wasting money with sloppy call or put purchases, and taking what the options market is giving you. Keep it simple, use the expected move and get the universe of trades closer to the binary decisions we make when we trade stock.

[Here's](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-5.48.59-PM.png) the full flowchart, bullish, bearish and neutral.

You'll notice that it organizes by short premium in the middle and lower probability long premium trades as it gets to the edges (duh) but what I think is helpful is how even on the long premium trades it accounts for selling as much premium as possible to finance that view. (or at least an easier way to think about it)

The focus is on 4 common (defined risk, multi-leg) options trades. Call spreads, put spreads, butterflies and condors and when to use them based on your expectations versus the crowd's. This is by no means an exhaustive list of potential trades. But these are a great starting point for those looking to use some smarter trade structures to express directional views. Strikes can of course be adjusted to slightly alter each trade. For instance, a call spread to the expected move can be set to be more in the money to get the breakeven in line with the stock, creating something quite similar to a stock alternative.

And as a decision tree on each:

* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday, just over half of the move expected over the next month, which is about 20%.
* The trading day following the prior earnings (in April) TSLA was higher by as much as +8.5% intraday before reversing and closing -2.5%. 
* On the day following the last 4 earnings, TSLA stock has closed higher twice and lower twice.

Here is the 1 month expected move chart for TSLA, with this Friday's expiration (via Options AI technology)  highlighted (+/-11.6%):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8exo5wkkjfc51.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd04dcc0f9f2a55248845f35148635c3edf247b

That's nearly $200 in either direction. The prior earnings in April, the stock had a $100 range intraday between its high and low (about 11%)  but only closed down -2.5%. The most it moved in either direction that day was +8.5%. The stock then went sideways for a few weeks before launching higher in early June and nearly doubling.

*Neutral* \- First let's look at neutral strategies that isolate the earnings itself, expiring this Friday: [Fly and Condor comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.37.02-AM.png)

The fly is quite a lot of risk so we'll focus on the **Iron Condor**,  which is 10 wide (the call spread and put spread are each 10 dollars wide, so risk is the total credit received from the 10). Here's how it  looks on the chart, with breakevens set near the expected move: [Condor](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.45.51-AM.png)

*Educational note - The reason the max gain of a condor is the total credit received of both spreads, whereas the max risk is the width of 1  spread (the wider of the two if they are not equal width) is because the stock can only be beyond the range in one direction on expiration, not both. Therefore one side will always expire worthless, at max gain, even if the other side is max loss.*

*Bullish* \- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's some trades based on a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time beyond  earnings, to August expiration. The bullish consensus is about $1930 in  August: [Bullish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.01.19-AM.png)

Here's a closer look at the **long call spread** (+1590/-1910) to the expected move: [Call spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.48.46-AM.png)

The +1590/1910 call spread breaks even near $1687 in the stock. It  costs about $97, which when looking at the individual strikes is  ""striking"" because it is selling the 1910 calls at about the same price: [Strike comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.57.30-AM.png)

In other words, a call spread to $1910 can be bought for about the same price as buying the 1910 call outright. That breakeven is lower in the stock by more than $300. ($1687 vs $2007).

Let's now zoom in on the bullish **short put spread** (-1590/+1270): [Short put spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.00.52-AM.png)

This is a high probability trade, that needs to risk more to make less. For those concerned about a collapse of implied volatility following an earnings event short spreads can be a way to express a  directional bias while also selling vol.

*Bearish -* Going the other direction in August, (bearish expected move about $1275) we can see these trades, via Options AI technology: [Bearish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.10.45-AM.png)

We see the bearish **short call spread** is on the other side of the advantage of the bullish long call spread above. It has to buy that really far out of the money call (1920 strike) to define its risk. But those calls are really bid up and a high implied vol, which severely damages its risk-reward profile. (It is selling an at the money  call at a lower vol than it is buying its out of the money call.)

The **long put spread**  (+1600/-1285) has a much lower breakeven, and therefore a worse probability of profit, but it does not have the same issues of unfavorable IV skew as the short call spread above. 

Also, the  strikes of that spread can be moved to make the put spread a bit more in  the money, moving the breakeven closer to where the stock is trading,  and taking advantage of the skew on the upside strikes: [ITM put spread](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.19.27-AM.png)

Tesla is likely to move a lot today before the event so exact strikes will change, but the overall percentage expected move should be roughly the same for all these examples.

896,One year into options trading: lessons learned,,283,8jsj8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8jsj8o/one_year_into_options_trading_lessons_learned/,1526448942.0,"I started trading options with actual money May of 2017. I keep notes as I trade so I thought I'd share some of the lessons I learned along the way, going from noob to an intermediate level. Interested in your thoughts and criticisms.

I should note that I am almost exclusively a premium seller so my notes are biased that direction.

Lessons learned:

* Have a plan. What will you do if the position goes your way? Against you? What's your profit target?
* Don't be too greedy. Take profits when the market hands them to you. When volatility shoots higher, stick with a similar profit target - don't try to make a ton more money from the opportunity.
* Have a large variety of **liquid** underlyings to choose from with a variety of betas. Try to stay delta neutral in your overall portfolio.
* In general, hard-limit single position size to 5% of your portfolio. I make exceptions for naked puts where I'm ok owning the stock, small accounts, and particularly fat pitches thrown my way (Kelly Criterion helps here).
* Primarily focus on managing the portfolio as a whole, not just individual positions.
* When an underlying is on the move, wait until it floors/ceilings up before opening a position.
* Always lowball/highball the mid when opening a position. This also creates a better anchor in your mind.
* Be patient. Don't feel like you need to place another trade right away just because one just ended. Wait for a solid opportunity. Don't fall victim to FOMO.
* Far OTM options don't decay the same as ATM options. It's important to understand why this is.
* Keep a decent-sized chunk of your portfolio in cash to cover margin expansion where applicable
* Don't fool yourself into thinking you have a crystal ball or have regret over not having had a crystal ball. Just stick to a strategy that works and make consistent returns.

Here are the strategies I've been using (more or less in order of frequency):

* Bull put spreads, primarily on SPX, RUT, NDX, and highly liquid equities
* Short puts on equities where I don't mind owning stock or want to own the stock
* Covered calls
* Short strangles
* Bear call spreads, usually within an iron condor or with the intention of going into an iron condor

Resources I've found most helpful:

* tradingview.com for charting
* https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active for finding liquid options
* ThinkOrSwim for backtesting ideas
* Google Sheets for tracking trades across accounts and brokerages
* Custom software I wrote to calculate things like Kelly Criterion and annualized return for various spreads and option premiums (very much a work in progress but [here is what it looks like](https://pastebin.com/KH7QJ24u))
* And of course, r/options

Goals for the next year:

* Become confident with a few more strategies
* Develop realistic backtesting software for strategies I use
* Finish reading _Option Pricing and Volatility_ (Natenberg)
* Read _Trading Options as a Professional_ (Bittman)
* Seek mentorship
* Don't make any clearly boneheaded trades",options

It’s been making me about 3% return a week for the last two months. I think I’m still in the honeymoon phase, and I need a reality check. So my strategy is essentially running the wheel on mid cap stocks that have been beaten down by the coronavirus(cruise lines and hotels mostly) but not exclusively. I’ve been selling weekly OTM Puts that I buy Monday about an hour before close. I pick out a company that is lower than open, and I do research to make sure there aren’t any big news events driving the price down in the near term future. I sell about 2%-4% below market price, WITH THE INTENTION OF GETTING ASSIGNED THE SHARES. I want to stress that enough. I do not mind getting assigned, I’m just in it for the premium. If I don’t get assigned, I roll it over and sell another OTM Put the next week. If I get assigned, I immediately turn around and sell a covered call at the exact same strike price. Basically, I’m trying to create weekly income regardless of the price of the stock. If the stock price goes down sharply, I sell a covered call for two weeks out. If the stock price still hasn’t recovered, I start to lower my covered call strike price, being conscious of the premium I’ve collected relative to the strike price and current stock price. I don’t see the problem with this, as I have the mindset that I am fine with holding the stock for a long time if need be. Please poke all the holes you want.

My thoughts: It's interesting to see the much smaller expected moves of companies set to report this week (towards the end of earnings season) as opposed to what we saw a few weeks ago. That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.

Let me know in the comments if you'd like to see anything added.

**Last Week**

* VIX closed Friday at 22.05, down slightly on the week and the lowest level since the Spring.
* Last week's expected move in SPY +/- 1.2%
* Last week’s actual move SPY: +0.7%

**The week ahead**

This week’s expected move in SPY, via Options AI technology +/- 1.3% SPY

902,Maybe I’m not cut out for options (at least in this market),,280,hnhzvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hnhzvj/maybe_im_not_cut_out_for_options_at_least_in_this/,1594218412.0,"I’m starting to have doubts

I’m 24. I’ve been investing since I was 17. 

For the last 7 years I’ve been a value investor. Essentially I looked for profitable companies with growing earnings that were statistically cheap/undervalued. 

I’d just buy and hold them for no more than two years.

I did well doing that. I averaged 20% to 22% a year. 

I’ve studied all the greats almost obsessively. I’ve read every book on Buffett and every book by Graham. 

I only learned about options this past May.  

To be honest I was about to get out of investing all together before I started learning options. While I did well with my buy and hold strategy I never had enough money invested to actually make any real money (I never had more than $10k invested).

I own my own business and was convinced I could make more money investing that $10k in my business than in stocks.

Then I discovered options 

I thought I found what I was looking for all along.

Scale 

It SEEMED like a match made in heaven. 

Buy calls on an undervalued stock or puts on an overvalued stock 6 to 8 months. 

I’d do my fundamental analysis like I did when I was buying and holding, figure out an estimate of what the company was worth, and buy calls and puts at those prices depending if the stock was undervalued or overvalued.

For example, if a stock was selling for $50 and my analysis said it was worth $15 I’d buy puts 8 months to a year out at $15

If I could value at stock at $75 that was selling for $20 I’d do the same thing and buy $75 calls 

I thought the returns would be significantly magnified. One of the books I bought and read on on the basics of options basically said that the great thing about options was how a relatively small move in the stock price could make the price of the option go up “100%, 500%, or even 1,000%+”

That’s why I wasn’t worried about the stocks going up to exactly what I valued them at. I figured that if I bought calls at a stock I valued at $50 when it was $25 even if the stock went to $30 or $40 I’d still see a huge return. 

If I held through two quarters it didn’t seem unreasonable to think a $25 stock could go to $30 or $40 with two really strong quarters or that a $50 stock could go to $30 from two bad quarters 

This SEEMED “safer” than short term options, technical analysis, etc.

Starting out my plan was to basically buy a basket of each. A basket of call options on undervalued stocks and a basket of puts on overvalued stocks. 

I knew upfront that I would probably be wrong on most but I saw it as an asymmetric risk (lose a little on most of them to make a lot on a handful)

Right now I’m sitting with 80% of my positions in puts on tech, travel, and restaurants. I started with calls actually. But, I switched to puts thinking that if the stocks really were overvalued they’d fall faster than the undervalued stocks would rise

It’s a bloodbath. The losses don’t bother me all that much (I only dedicated $1,500 to try this and am down $150) but I’m kind of concerned I might get wiped out with this strategy/approach

If anyone can suggest an options strategy that can work with undervalued/overvalued stocks I’d love to hear it",options

Here’s Swaggy’s Unusual Option Activity summary for the week. It was an interesting week with lots of choppy and bearish action. Option flow was pretty light, but some names showed some strength and some decent set-ups.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

&#x200B;

**DKNG – DraftKing**

Draftkings sweepers came in throughout the day on September 9. Big call buying across the board pushing this stock higher as traders ride momentum.

https://preview.redd.it/qoz2pf05qxm51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ca6d80a92cea92ce1ba46c76d37cd3e208b327f

**AMAT – Applied Materials**

AMAT saw a few big plays with large volume of bullish call contracts and a short put block. AMAT was hit pretty hard in the last 2 weeks and is down approx. 20% from the recent highs. Looks like players are selling puts looking for a floor and buying calls expecting a bounce. Most of these blocks are for January 2021 expiration and seem pretty bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/3ejq49r5qxm51.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=497b055b139862cf203954efd0b52c74183637fc

**CPB – Campbell Soup**

Campbell Soup is an unusual name to see option flow, so it’s something to keep an eye on. Last time they saw big bullish activity was early September before earnings. CPB has also shaved off about 20% from recent highs and a player sold to open over 13k PUT contracts expiring in two weeks (September 25). The player collects $350k premium if CPB stays above $43 (now $45.50). Seems to be another player expecting short-term bottom in some beaten-down names.

**GPS – Gap**

GAP some some mixed flow, but pretty heavy recent volume. Tough to say exactly what the player is trying to achieve here, but each block was for over 10k contracts with the same expiration.

https://preview.redd.it/g1tklqj7qxm51.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b53dd5d9f6e59a0fe0024051c08d27f08aacc83

**PLUG – Plug Power**

PLUG power saw a boatload of bullish flow coming through the last several days. It was a mix of put-selling and call buying. The largest block I caught was 17k contracts for next week’s (September 18) expiration. The play is 5% OTM and about $1 million in premium. As with most stocks, PLUG got beaten up the last 2 weeks and perhaps the player is looking for a strong rebound this week.

https://preview.redd.it/2t74oxb8qxm51.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=11dcc564aa5f9154e4495213983eaf4d3bd16e7f

**ZNGA – Zynga**

ZNGA saw a huge buyer of 22k November 20, 2020 call contracts this week. The position has a strike of $8 and about $2.5 million in premium. This is the biggest call block in ZNGA in about 6 weeks. A couple weeks ago it looks as if someone closed part of a position of sold PUTS. The 20k contracts is pretty large in size for this ticker. Will be interesting to follow ZNGA over the next week or two.

(Important),,271,irqiz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/irqiz1/when_do_options_expire_important/,1599966168.0,It seems that options expire at market close on Friday but this is not the case. Options can be exercised until 5:30 pm the Friday of expiration. That means most traders have an hour and a half Friday after close to exercise their option. The reason this is important is because an option seller might think he’s clear of any obligation once the market closes. He is thinking about how much ice cream he can buy with the premium he has received but little does he know it can be exercised much later. The short put he sold at $100 seems to be expired but some bad news after hours leads the stock to tumble from $105 to $90 and the person who bought the put exercised it. Now the Option Writer has to take responsibility for these shares and is assigned shares at $100 when the underlying is trading for $90 for a loss of $10 per share.

I never go into margins due to my low risk appetite, and I generally own various stocks and sell cash secured put options. On May 1st, I received a notification saying that one of the 4 BA cash secured puts was bought to close with a loss. I was baffled since I did not recall making an order, and I have enough cash to buy the stocks so it couldn't have been the system forcing me to close. After waiting in line for 2 hours to get the customer service person on the phone (yep, that's the standard for Firstrade), I was informed that Firstrade's system sold my position but they are not sure why, they need to ""clear things up"" with the clearing firm, and that I should apply for level 4 margin account to prevent the same thing from happening again. After losing their client's money due to a mistake, Firstrade's response is essentially ""increase your risk appetite to prevent losing more money"".

I asked for a follow-up and waited for two weeks with no news, so I eventually called and asked for the manager. After speaking to several clueless reps and being put on hold for several 30-minute chunks, I finally got to speak to the head of Firstrade's trading desk, who proceeded to repeat the same gibberish about how they are not sure what happened, they will take more time to investigate it if I want, and I should either downgrade the margin account to level 2 which does not allow verticals or upgrade it to level 4. As to the prospect of getting compensated for the loss incurred by Firstrade's ""not-sure-how-it-happened"" mistake? That they are sure is not gonna to happen.

In the end I lost 80 from the puts and 400 from the opportunity cost, but this experience indicated to me that **Firstrade is not a trust-worthy broker and could potentially lose their clients lots of money while having ""no idea how it happened""**. I currently have my play money with them but will move it somewhere else once I close my positions.

Tldy: Firstrade closed my cash-secured puts without my permission, refused to compensate me for the loss, and pushed me to apply for higher level margin account as their ""solution"".",options

I’ve been holding them up until now

Yesterday at 9pm the 193 Call got assigned and I went on Margin Call for $600,000

I already contacted Robinhood and someone responded back but their taking a while to really help

What am I supposed to do? Do I owe Robinhood $600,000 dollars?

My 192 contract is worth $119,000 and I got a credit of $250,000 that hasn’t come through yet? Am I supposed to get this?

My buying power is also negative $1,200,000

Hey all so exercised the call and I am NO LONGER IN A MARGIN CALL!!!! Although my buying power still shows -$1,400,000. Someone explained that this is still fine though so l I’ll update this post later tonight if anything changes thank you all

I swear I thought I was in big doodoo and didn’t even get an ounce of sleep last night

**UPDATE: First and foremost I wanna thank each and everyone of you for helping me. The amount of people on here that we’re helpful and gave me real deployable advice is second to none.**

**I am in debted to all of you for helping me through this and some more than others. From the bottom of my heart thank you. If it wasn’t for you guys I would’ve been in absolute chaos.**

Update: Really I’m only worried about the negative $1,400,000 buying power but a lot of you ave reassured me that’s going away with nothing to worry about so hopefully by tomorrow morning it’s completely gone

Edit: if the negative $1,400,000 is still there tomorrow what are the next steps anyone know? Still a little shaken up by this tbh. But I know all of you reassured me this is going away soon and it’s nothing to worry about.

**UPDATE: I DO have margin on! Here is the image https://imgur.com/gallery/vH8qFgC , I have $50k on RKT and another similar amount in BIGC does this change the negative $1,400,000??? Does this mean this ISNT going away?**

But the why...Why does OpEx affect VIX?  What are market participants doing on OpEx that would suppress VIX?

And going forward, is this the new normal for VIX?  Or are VIX/VXX calls 'free money' given the uncertainty of earnings season and covid resurgence likely leading to policy negatively affecting commerce in the US?

I Googled this a bit before asking, promise. I read over the formula to calculate VIX, but what numbers going into the equation changed to cause this lowering.

Due to popular request by the folks in r/thetagang, [a formal study of ""The Wheel"" is now live.](https://spintwig.com/spy-wheel-45-dte-cash-secured-options-backtest/#Results)

Follow the link to:

* see P/L curves binned by exit mechanic
* review charts and tables highlighting various performance metrics such as max drawdown, total P/L, Sharpe ratio, total return, etc.
* take an ""under the hood"" dive that looks into the strategies that experienced the greatest (5D hold-till-expiration) and least (50D early mgmt) total return
* learn how the wheel strat is materially influenced by timing luck

Takeaways / TLDR:

* All strategies except 30D early mgmt and 50D early mgmt were profitable
* 30D hold-till-expiration had the greatest risk-adjusted return among the wheel strats
* No wheel strat outperformed buy/hold SPY with regard to total return
* No wheel strat outperformed buy/hold SPY with regard to risk-adjusted return

**BMY – Bristol Myers**

Looks like player opened up a synthetic short position by selling July 17 calls for a credit of $190k, and player purchased July 17 puts for $3.1 million in premium. Each leg in the position was opened at the $62.5 strike. Essentially this position compares very closely to a short stock position. This option flow stood out as there is not normally large activity going through this stock.

**DXC – DXC Technology**

Saw something very interesting today in DXC. For a stock ticker that has relatively low option volume we saw an enormous position opened today. A player sold 93,000 August 21 calls at $17 strike for a credit of $16 million and opened 93,000 August 21 puts at $16 strike paying a premium of $18 million. The 93,000 volume on these options compares to the only 200 OI for the same strikes. DXC is a small cap stock with a market cap of only $4 billion. A trade of this size would be classified as extremely unusual.

\*After doing some research it seems this position is tied to $150 million stock position. Then you need to ask yourself, why would you sell a covered call and enter a long PUT position if you have a large position in shares. Seems like someone knows something is up and is expecting a big drop soon.

[Here's a Yahoo Finance link to the option chain, although they don't have the strike for the PUT contracts available for some weird reason](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DXC/options?p=DXC&date=1597968000)

**AMZN – Amazon Inc**

There wasn’t anything specifically unusual about any trades in AMZN. There was a lot of smaller long positions opened with near-term expiration for tomorrow or next week. Seems like a lot of players were riding the momentum throughout the day and also caused more buying pressure that pushed the stock up. AMZN had good momentum for most of the day and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was from the call activity.

We’ll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

**DDOG**

DDOG was fairly active last week after the stock jumped 15% on the news of a deal with MSFT. One would assume the MSFT deal will be huge in terms of size and might attract more clients for DDOG. Most of the flow was pretty short-term (2-3 weeks) expecting the stock to continue it’s upward momentum. October 16 and November 20 were the common expiration dates with most plays being out-the-money.

**PINS**

PINS saw some BIG buyers on Thursday as players expect the stock to perform well in the short-term. Players were buying strikes all across the board with each position being in the range of 3,000-7,000 contracts a piece. The largest positions were $4-5 million. Pretty heavy bullish flow, will definitely add this ticker in my stocks to watch this week. PINS will be reporting earnings toward the end of the month of October.

**SFIX**

SFIX the e-commerce fashion brand with a subscription model for receiving fitted clothes. A stock with generally low volume in option flow saw some huge buys coming in. Biggest positions were for the December 2020 expiration, long calls and put-selling makes it for some heavily bullish sentiment. SFIX is set to report earnings 1 week before these options expire, so IV will be relatively high for that expiration date. If you go 2 weeks earlier you will be able to find “cheaper” options that don’t include the earnings report.

**ZNGA**

ZNGA saw a few big plays roll thru on Friday an hour before close. Option flow sentiment this week has been higher than normal and quite bullish. Some of the bigger plays were for over 10k contracts a piece, call-buying AND put-selling. ZNGA reports at the end of October.

**MAC**

Macerich Company (MAC) was another name with some bullish option flow. The stock has been on a steady downtrend over the last 3 months dropping to a low in the $6.75 range. Thursday around the time the stock started to show some strength a big purchase of 3,200 calls came through for March 2021 expiration. I like these longer-term plays when I see them because it gives the player a bit more time for everything to turn out how they expect. MAC continued to rally up 6% on Friday, so the player has already earned a decent amount so far.

**VNQ**

Vanguard Real Estate (VNQ) had some players buying the dip over the last week when the stock dropped to $76 range. Looks like most action was put-selling expecting the the stock to get back above $80-81 in the next month or two. Since the action already happened the stock is up 10% and already trading at $81. Have we missed the boat on this one? Maybe, but interesting to see how these “big” plays end up working out more often than not.

**CNP**

I saved the most unusual for last, CenterPoint Energy (CNP). A player opened a SHORT STRANGLE where they SOLD both a call and put position. They sold the $20.5 strike calls, as well as sold the $19 strike puts to collect a total premium of $700k. This strategy is a THETA play where they expect little movement in the stock price until expiration in 4 weeks time. In theory if the player realizes max profit he will have made $35k per day that the market was open (from the time position was opened to option expiration).

Morgan misses profit expectations for the first time in 15 quarters,,257,ag9187,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ag9187/jp_morgan_misses_profit_expectations_for_the/,1547562545.0,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/jp-morgan-is-set-to-report-fourth-quarter-earnings--heres-what-the-street-expects.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/jp-morgan-is-set-to-report-fourth-quarter-earnings--heres-what-the-street-expects.html)

&#x200B;

[J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=JPM) posted quarterly profit below analysts' expectations for the first time in 15 quarters on weaker-than-expected bond-trading revenue.  

 

The bank generated $1.98 per share in profit for the fourth quarter of 2018, below the $2.20 per share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The biggest shortfall appeared to come from the New York-based bank's trading division, where fixed-income trading produced $1.86 billion in revenue, compared to the $2.2 billion estimate.

The lender's shares dropped 2.7 percent to $98.23 in pre-market trading Tuesday.

&#x200B;

J.P. Morgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is closely watched as a bellwether for the financial industry. So analysts may inquire about how the bank sees loan losses developing in 2019: The firm set aside $1.55 billion for credit losses, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier and $250 million more than analysts' $1.3 billion estimate. The bank said it was preparing for rising losses in retail credit cards and commercial and industrial loans.

""Despite a challenging quarter, we grew markets revenue in the investment bank for the year with record performance in equities and solid performance in fixed income,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in the earnings release.

 

In his remarks, Dimon also addressed the U.S. political dysfunction that is now threatening to slow economic growth: In 2019, ""we urge our country's leaders to strike a collaborative, constructive tone, which would reinforce already-strong consumer and business sentiment. Businesses, government and communities need to work together to solve problems and help strengthen the economy for the benefit of everyone.""

Still, the bank noted that its $7.1 billion in profit, a nearly 70 percent increase from the year earlier, was a fourth-quarter record. Company-wide revenue rose 4 percent to $26.8 billion, just under analysts' $26.84 billion estimate. Across the firm's core lending operations, businesses were strong: The firm posted a 9 percent increase to $14.5 billion in net interest income on loan growth and rising interest rates.

 

The lender posted net interest margin, a key profitability figure, of 2.54 percent, an improvement of 3 basis points from the previous quarter that matched analysts' expectations.

Non-interest expenses rose 6 percent to $15.7 billion, slightly higher than analysts' $15.6 billion estimate, as the firm invested in technology and high-level hires.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bank stocks were pummeled last year, particularly in the fourth quarter, on fears that a worsening U.S.-China trade war and global recession could be on the horizon, meaning rising losses across consumer and corporate loans. It was a comedown after the U.S. tax overhaul meant banks would produce billions of dollars more in profit in 2018, setting expectations for a rally in bank shares.

Still, under Dimon, J.P Morgan has exceeded analysts' profit expectations for 15 straight quarters -- up until the fourth quarter of 2018. The bank has leading market share in retail, corporate and investment banking lines, giving it a diverse set of businesses to lean on when a particular area suffers. 

 

Choppy markets in December probably crimped trading and investment banking fees at J.P. Morgan, according to Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. Trading and investment banking revenue for the biggest U.S. banks probably fell up to 10 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by weakness in fixed income trading and debt and equity issuance.

On Monday, rival bank Citigroup [posted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/11/citigroup-earnings-q4-2018.html) profit that beat analysts' estimates on cost cutting and a revenue shortfall triggered by a 21 percent decline in fixed income trading. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report later this week. 

 Shares of J.P. Morgan fell 8.7 percent last year, the smallest decline among the six biggest banks and a better showing than the 20 percent decline of the KBW Bank Index. As a result, J.P. Morgan has the highest price-to-book value among its peers. 

&#x200B;

 Here's what Wall Street expected:  


Earnings: $2.20 a share, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv.  


Revenue: $26.8 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from a year earlier.  


Net Interest Margin: 2.54 percent, according to FactSet  


Trading Revenue: Equities $1.29 billion, Fixed Income $2.20 billion

Never mind that I was starting with $5k. Like many, I burned my hand trading too large attempting to make more money and it simply set me back. Looking back at it, I failed to appreciate by extending my investing horizon even marginally, it would have a profound impact on my future wealth. I am extremely fortunate in that at 29, I have surpassed my wealth development goal for 35. I say this not as a bragging point - but a very real reminder for the younger crowd starting at 17-20 that if you focus more on developing your wealth for when you’re even 30 vice 23 or 25, you will likely benefit considerably via lower risk trading. Most younger folks can’t fathom waiting until 40, which is why I chose 30 above. Let’s explore a rendition of my experience. 

- Started investing at 17 with $5k that I had saved from birthday gifts and working
- Began with buy and hold, moved to derivatives by mid 18
- Initially focused on being profitable, then 10% and 15% return per year 
- Performed well, but was anxious that although the % return was reasonable, the dollar amount was still small 
- I started to focus on $ return, at one point traded an Iron Condor (far OTM and wide) to make $650 over 7 days. A big too large for the account size at the time.
- I experienced an outsized move that took me out of my trade with over a $30k loss 
- This occurred at 20 years old

My CAGR from 2007-2019 is 19.44%. That $30k loss chasing an outsized return because of impatience from 20-29, im out $148k. I continue to share these stories because it is by far one of my biggest regrets starting out. 

Starting young is so great yet many squander it with impatience. Do not set yourself back trying to make a quick buck now. I know it’s difficult, I had the same exact issue but do your best to think of even a slightly longer term game. I talk about it frequently in my small stacks segment - if I were to start over knowing what I do now, I would focus on developing a consistent strategy. The money will grow as you save, earn more from work or business ventures, etc. the most valuable component is the skill set. That’s what will truly pay out longer term.",options

Got early assignment on a GRMN put spread -- no big deal, it happens. I went into RH to sell the shares when it looked like an intraday local peak, sold those, which took me out of brief margin call due to the assignment, and then the price dropped as I'd expected.

I went to sell the long puts that I was still holding from my spread and RH says:""You can't place this order because you had a recent assignment on GRMN puts. Please contact support for help."" I called, emailed, and lost my mind as the stock retraced back up. No response. After a couple of hours, one of their brokers went in and sold my long puts (which were NOT on margin) while the price was at an intraday high again.

My spread had max loss of about $300. When all this happened, I should have actually profited about $600. Due to RH preventing me from trading my long puts that I owned *free of margin* and were not being held against any short position or margined instruments, I took an $1000 loss, mostly due to time decay and price movement while waiting for them to respond. They even sold my (again) **non-margined** puts well below the mid price.

Fuck RH. I get that they won't allow you to sell the puts while you're still holding the assigned shares on margin, but it's bullshit that they will allow you to sell the shares and then prevent you from getting out of time-decaying long options positions.

BTW -- I have a real broker, I just use RH for spreads that involve a lot of contracts and don't depend much on fill quality to close. Their policy on assignment makes little sense. How can they demand I satisfy a margin call, allow me to sell overnight assignment to do that, and then lock me from completely closing decaying -theta options position?!",options

Even as a novice, I know better but still do the things I shouldn't.  Not wanting to cut my losses, greed, not  ""settling for small"" profits on home run attempt trades- which itself should be a no-no for me.  

I'd go up working small, CC, credit spreads over say 10 or 20 trades, any where from $50-300  er trade then enter dumb dumb trades and throw away my money.  

Sort of breakdown of my 45 days  
+4,900, winning trades, mostly CCs and credit spreads  
-7,500, losing trades, mostly long calls, over 5000 of that on just **2** trades.    

Coincidentally all my losers, long calls and/or earning plays.  
The big 2 losers, an earnings play on AMZN this week and a ""YoLoOOo"" on TSLA a few weeks ago when it fell below 400 thinking surely it'd bounce back to 420 by week's end... seriously... I did that.

* take the time to educate yourself, don't be like me learning on the fly with real money half ass-idly and only now making a serious attempt to get comfortable with the greeks and other fundamentals after a month in already.
* game plan your trade, size, entry, exit and stick to it.  Sizing is important, chasing bigger profits with bigger allocation per portfolio, be careful.
* on the medium/high risk stuff, take your profits, 20-50%, view that as 100%
* exit that losing trades, if you can't adjust, in a way that makes sense and not just to prolong the loss, take the exit
* pay attention to your psyche, biases, etc. History doesn't always repeat, forget shoulda/woulda/couldas.
* if you're going to gamble as in going into trades you really don't have a clue on except ""earnings"" or some other event, if you don'y yet have good understanding of IV and how it can explode premiums, gamble small.  I like this on the TSLA call, even with the price going up the call was losing value.

For me personally, trading is not stressful whatsoever and many in my trading circle echo the same. If you are stressed while trading, that typically is a good indication that we need to make some adjustments as traders. The markets are inherently volatile and are subject to an unlimited number of uncontrollable inputs and circumstances. We cannot do anything about this so worrying about it does absolutely nothing. There are a ton of variables we CAN control and if we are effective at it, we can develop a solid trading plan that reduces a significant amount of stress. Below are a few key concepts as to WHY trading is not stressful for me.

This is unique to my life experience but a key input nonetheless. I spent 6 years as a Marine Officer and worked in life or death situations frequently. This has permanently skewed my stress ""baseline"". Nobody is getting shot at, nobody is going to die from this.

Onto the things we can ALL control as traders:  
\- Having a PLAN. Taking the time to draft something you think would be effective, testing it, validating against your preferred metrics, and talking through your plan with someone you trust in the investing space is an irreplaceable component. The longer you spend tweaking the plan and integrating your experiences, the less excitable we become. Sold a put and the stock tanks? Sold a call and the underlying flies up? We can define a structurally sound approach for all. Worrying doesn't help solve problems - planning does.  
\-Define Variables. There are a tremendous amount of moving parts in options trading. It's one of the beauties of it. For some, the number of inputs can be overwhelming. If we take the time to breakdown the key inputs that matter to us and define ranges, we can limit adverse reactions to those inputs.  
\-LIMIT YOUR RISK. Probably the biggest input. If you have too much risk on, you're going to stress the fuck out. It's inevitable. If you have adequately sized your trades and account and are comfortable with the risk profile, you are far less likely to flip if things turn against you.

I'd love to hear some of the things that limit the stress you experience while trading.

I encourage EVERYONE to wait out this absolute shit storm.

HOWEVER, AFTERWARDS, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LEAVE. Every single person with an account needs to withdraw their funds and close their account. MAKE THEM SUFFER. There are plenty of other platforms who don’t crash during volatility and don’t prevent us from trading like Robinhood has. Fidelity for example is free and I think you can even import assets from another brokerage directly without selling / re-buying. Ive heard TD-Ameritrade is decent as well.

I wanted to buy 12c 08/21 which was trading at 0.18 at the time. I placed the order for 20 contracts and it would not take the limit of 0.18 on RH, it kept saying that the trade has to be in 5cent increments so I had to place a limit buy with .20 limit. The order executed for 20cents a contract (total $400) and I was already down $40 as soon as the buy executed. So now I waited for the Corn report and knew it was bad. In a bid to minimize my losses I wanted to sell my contracts and they were still trading at 18cents for the 12c 08/21, but then again I was unable to place the sell order with a limit of 0.18 as RH said it had to be in 5cent multiples. So I placed a Limit sell at 0.20

So I decided to wait it out and see if by any chance the contract would go up in value to 0.20 so I can break even and sell at 0.20. Well the 8/21 calls started dropping in value and suddenly started trading at 0.13 not even 0.15. Now I just decided to sell no matter what and was forced to set limit of .10 since if I set it at 0.15 it would not sell, just like it had not sold at 0.20. So I end up placing sell limit order at 0.10 which executed immediately so my total loss within a span of couple of hours was 50% ($200) of my initial $400 investment.

Am I making some rookie mistake here??

Edit: How do you place market orders to not lose money this way and be able to buy/sell at the market price which is not a multiple of 5 cents?? Just to be clear this is my question.

I see regularly about why traders depart from a trade,    
 before 100 percent of a potential gain is obtained.     

---  

**Risk to reward ratio changes over the life of an option: a reason for an early exit.**  

It is useful to transform an exit guide's conception, from a fixed rule,   
 for example, exiting a credit spread position upon 50% of maximum gains,  into an examination of the changing risk to reward ratios as the position ages, and the ability to find better Risk to Reward opportunities with your limited capital, and also to exit from less desirable R to R positions, when positions age and mature.        

This gives you the tools to think more flexibly and strategically     
on an ongoing basis about your position,         
and have a principle that you can reason about.  

The below looks at an ongoing trade, as if the trader were to enter it freshly, at some later stage in the trade, and look at whether such a ""new"" trade would be worth undertaking, on a risk to reward basis compared to other choices available. 

---
  
To illustrate, I'll pick on  hypothetical  XYZ's stock, which is at $100.         
Sell a **vertical call credit spread**  on XYZ, for 45 day expiration,       
at strikes of 105 and 110, for a net credit of $1.00    

The goal is to close the short call spread position,  
 by buying the position back for less than the credit proceeds received, or by expiring worthless.    (I could write up a similar scenario for a long vertical debit call spread,   with the goal in that case, to sell the long spread for more than I paid.) 

---

**On day one**   
the net risk of the option credit spread, (105 minus 110) of $5.00,   
less the credit proceeds received, $1.00, for a net risk of $4.00.    
(If I go to maximum loss, and buy back the spread for $5.00,      
my net  money transactions are credit $1.00 and debit $5.00)    
Your net gain is zero at this time.     
The reward is the potential to transform the $1.00 credit into an earned gain.    
**Risk to potential reward is  $4 risk to $1 gain**        

**After 15 days**, the option spread's value is worth  $0.75.    
The holder risks losing the gain so far, in addition to the original risk.       
New risk: original risk of $4, plus potential to lose the gain of $0.25 for a total of $4.25,    
New potential reward:  0.75   
New Risk to Reward:  4.25 to 0.75, or **5.67 to 1**   

**After 10 more days, on day 25**, option spread's value is 0.50.     
New risk:  4.25 + 0.25 = $4.50   
New potential reward: $0.50    
New R to R:  4.5 to 0.50  or **9 to 1**     

**After  day 35** 
For various reasons, at this point, the            
Option spread's value is  $0.25   
Risk is  $4.75   
New potential reward is  $0.25   
New R to R is 4.75 to 0.25 or   **19 to 1**.   


The risk at day 25 or 35, is that the trader might lose all of their gains,    
and the original risk, for a  modest additional gain.       
This might be worthwhile if XYZ had gone down in price from $100 to $90,   
and thus less likely to run up $15 in price to challenge the trade at strike $105.   
But not so worthwhile a risk if XYZ had gone to a price of $102,    
and needs only a $3 movement to upset the trade.  

---

More significantly,  there may be other better trades and ways to use your capital,        
later in the life of a trade, with different probabilities, by using your funds to start a new and better risk to reward ratio trade,  
than say 9 to 1, or 19 to 1.      
Thus the early exit for better risk to reward ratios.   

Also, towards expiration, other risks become more prominent, such as gamma risk, in which underlying price moves can affect the value of the options more rapidly than at 30 to 45 days from expiration.

969,Short + Long Option Plays [07/20/2020],,240,huwfat,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/huwfat/short_long_option_plays_07202020/,1595287972.0,"**Recap**

Last week, I posted Bullish Option Plays \[2-4 Month Horizon\], found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish\_options\_plays\_24\_month\_horizon/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish_options_plays_24_month_horizon/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

**TL, DR:**

*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, $1.30 DOWN to $1.12 today*

*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, $0.79 DOWN to $0.63 today*

*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.25 UP to $4.25 today*

*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.45 UP to $4.50 today*

*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.05 DOWN to $2.77 today*

*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.40 DOWN to $3.20 today*

*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, $0.50 UP to $1.50 today*

TWTR and ERIC contracts netted +$305 on a $720 investment. WFC and LUV netted -$79 on a $854 investment. *These figures are based on buying one of each contract last week and selling them today*.

**This post covers 3 Bullish or Bearish Option Plays across various industries.**

Criteria for selecting Option Plays:

* 500MM + Market Cap
* Average Daily Volume 5MM +
* Uptrend or Downtrend detected

Using these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of long plays is that the stock only needs to move a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.

**1) Twitter $TWTR \[Technology\] - BULLISH**

I recommended Twitter last week, and will do it again. Earnings, shaking off the security breach, and upcoming features all make $TWTR a very strong bullish pick.

Twitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:

[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)

This is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months. Twitter is up 3.5% today with earnings on Thursday, 3 days away.

Bullish Twitter Case:

Investments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.

The deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.

Growth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[29B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[30M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Strong upward trend since March\]

[$TWTR overlay with $SNAP and $FB - the three social media giants posting huge gains](https://preview.redd.it/v52p8ht793c51.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=51c3f1edbc2536059e6e50a3db71f854245097a1)

The value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.

The security fears involving accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the like have been squashed. By taking the breach as a positive, Twitter will beef up security for their accounts and prevent such attacks from occurring again.

Lets take a look at the options scanner:

[Big money on a upwards $TWTR move, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/fcwcfeuya3c51.png?width=1946&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69a702620df59648ab047e9beb964d89372fa8a)

Despite recommending this play last week, $TWTR surprised even me these past few days, completely powering through the security breach and meeting my % target 2 months early. Today, taking a Strike of $40, that is 8% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.

With this information, I propose:

**Short Term Play \[HIGH RISK\]:**

*TWTR $40c Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.81 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*

**Long Term Play:**

*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $4.50 at time of writing. 35% Probability ITM*

**2) Moderna $MRNA \[Biotechnology\] - BEARISH**

$MRNA has been riding the wave of COVID-19, and mercilessly profiteering off vaccine news. It popped on my radar because it made it on my most active movers watchlist, down 12% today.

[Moderna Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/3qi2d44fe3c51.png?width=3244&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fce5c1c7700bc516502f662ee67ef42e6844ffe)

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[32B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[43M\]
* Downtrend detected \[Strong downtrend, crashing off ATH\]

[$MRNA has a history of big dumps. This looks like one of them.](https://preview.redd.it/x8qxdyzre3c51.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c59845274f6c1f3b8f28121e90d80706a8b442)

Directly from Nasdaq, here is the insider activity that $MRNA brass have been undertaking. A staggering 15,685,052 shares sold vs 55,568 bought in the **last 3 months**. Has executives selling a stock ever been a bullish sign?

[Out of 15,740,620 shares traded in 3 months, only 55,568 were bought. From NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/7qx22f53d3c51.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef9c35c4d5da6f8a46f48bfe2a96c79310c8d46a)

Profiteering off vaccine news, insider selling, a history of large drops, and meets all the criteria; $MRNA is a prime candidate for a bearish play.

Let's take a look at the options scanner:

[Someone selling a huge amount of $105 calls last week](https://preview.redd.it/61hge25pf3c51.png?width=1982&format=png&auto=webp&s=68260ba42121a31e067dc2a41b9e6b3dc2aac6c3)

The expiration and sheer quantity of premium collected on these theta plays tell me that someone with at least $25,000,000 in buying power is betting against $MRNA.

With this information, I propose:

**Short Term Play \[HIGH RISK\]:**

*MRNA $60p Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.83 at time of writing. 20% Probability ITM.*

**Long Term Play:**

*MRNA $55p Oct 16 2020, trading $5.25 at time of writing. 34% Probability ITM.*

**3) Beyond Meat $BYND \[Food, Major Diversified\] - BULLISH**

Everyone remembers the run up of BYND, and the spectacular crash. Unsurprisingly, it is hardly talked about across finance communities anymore, because it is finally consolidating around a range that I can feel comfortable with, especially with the quiet adoption of plant-based food sweeping the country and fast food chains.

Bullish Beyond Meat case:

Plant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category.

Beyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand’s strong performance in taste tests (consistently second only to privately held Impossible Foods).

We think Beyond Meat is the most likely PBM supplier to secure a U.S. deal with McDonald's, as Impossible Foods has backed out of the race, stating it does not have sufficient capacity to supply the chain.

[Beyond Meat Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/x9hk3tewh3c51.png?width=3320&format=png&auto=webp&s=35905e85c4db29eddeaee79d6a57fd40d8cb4b89)

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[8B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[5M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Consolidating near support, KFC news\]

[$120-$130 has served as a key support\/resistance for $BYND in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9d45mw4ai3c51.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=289c0441e2f8099179fc4320add1676a4fdce397)

There was no recent options data for $BYND found by the scanner.

With this information, I propose:

**Long Term Play:**

*BYND $165c Jan 15 2021, trading $14.85 at time of writing. 23% Probability ITM.*

**Conclusion**

Based on my research, $TWTR still has momentum, $MRNA has shown its cards, and they don't even have a pair, $BYND is slowly making moves to establish itself as the undisputed PBM contender.

**TL,DR:**

**Short Term Play \[HIGH RISK\]:**

*TWTR $40c Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.81 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*

*MRNA $60p Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.83 at time of writing. 20% Probability ITM.*

**Long Term Play:**

*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $4.50 at time of writing. 35% Probability ITM*

*MRNA $55p Oct 16 2020, trading $5.25 at time of writing. 34% Probability ITM.*

*BYND $165c Jan 15 2021, trading $14.85 at time of writing. 23% Probability ITM.*

&#x200B;

**- Money/risk management:** Every morning, I remind myself about risk. I remind myself that I want to play this game until I die. In order to get to that point, you cannot let 1 single trade wipe out your account. RISK is very important in this game. I view risk split into $$$ and time. When you are about to enter a trade, you and only you get to set up the trade with your personal risk tolerance. If you believe I am not risking more than $200 on this trade, then let it be $200. If you believe that on this particular trade I am willing to risk a little more to make potentially more, than increase the risk but be aware that you could lose it all. When I enter a trade, I always think I lose on it. Setting up one's expectation on the trade properly before you enter is a good habit to get into. With that said, then there's time risk. IF you are in the trade for 30 minutes. You're at a higher risk than someone who happened to enter the trade with the same $$$ risk, but was only in it for 5 minutes. Makes sense correct? If you jump into a trade with say $1,000 and will only stay in the trade for 2 minutes (more to that ""discipline"" later), you might be at less risk than someone who gets into the trade with $600 but is in the trade for 2 hours. Once you are out of the trade (at this point the result of whether you won or lost doesn't matter), you can no longer be at risk. The market could drop all the way to 0 or run up 1500 DOW points and you could care less. BE AWARE of how much $$$ risk and how much time risk you're planning to give this and everyone of your trades before you enter it.

**- Patience is key:** Imagine this picture. You're a king sitting on his throne inside your own palace. You've got villains all lined up below you. All that's keeping you and those people apart are 100 stairs up towards your throne. Each and every morning, those villains WANT to come and see you. They want your attention. They may each walk up those 100 stairs, present you with a little gift, and YOU, only YOU get to decide if you want to give them some of your time, or if you simply refuse because what you see is not worth your effort and/or time. You send them back off to the main floor one at a time. ONLY when someone happens to walk up the stairs to you and shows you something that you've been waiting for. Something that you've longed because you know what you want, only then can they spend some time with you. This same principle goes with your selection of stocks. Each and every day, you flip through the charts on your say 10 stocks of choice. You watch them daily. You're very familiar with them and how they tend to move. They're like your kids. You're so familiar with them, that before they react to something or might say something, you rudely interrupt them and say do not do this or say that. They'd be wondering *HOW THE HELL DID YOU KNOW*...; back to the list of your stocks. You flip through the charts every morning when you decide to trade. You look for certain setups, candle formations, patterns if you will, etc, and you ACT on it alone. If nothing sets up, then let it be. There'll always be tomorrow, when another villain might walk up those 100 stairs and present you with the set up you've been longing to trade again. Then strike and (hopefully) profit. Rinse and repeat (daily).

**- Japanese candlesticks:** Do yourself a favor, learn about Japanese candlesticks. There are many books out there, but the one I still hold dearly (because I've read it so many times over and over), is the original Steve Nison's Japanese candlestick book. You want to go over that material like your life matters. WHY? Because they will give you the edge in your trading. Yes, you heard it right. They are part of the edge that you have longed for in trading. They speak a language. They speak the language of the bulls and/or bears. They show you visually who has the upper hand. If you trade off that alone, and you can improve on that practice, you'll be better off than too many spaghetti lines (sorry, I just had lunch like I mentioned in my previous post) on your chart. KISS principle. Keep your charts clean. Simple. Trade off the action that is presented (live) in front of you. Price action and/or Japanese candlestick is what you want to spend hours and hours on if there's anything else you'd consider ""homework"" (screen time very important!).

**- List of rules of yourself:** Everyone needs to do this at some point in their trading life/career. You get to sit down, pull out a piece of paper & pen, and start to write down your rules for trading. Some call it goals, plans, or simply a list of trading rules. Be as accurately as possible in that list. It defines you. You will create this list based on your own emotions, life's experiences, life's environment and how important money is to you. You see, for some people, $500 is nothing, so they aim for $1,500/day in profit. Someone else, who works a regular 8-5 job making say $15/hour would be happy to write down $200/day because that would allow them to ""stop"" working if they choose to do so. Someone might write down that they do not trade off phones. Someone else might write down that they will never touch the market from 10 - 2pm because of little to no activity in the market. Some people might write down that they will never average into a trade. I personally view adding into a trade not as something taboo for trading. Your own trading style and experience will/should tell you when to add or not. Once you've come up with that list, be sure to read it every morning for good several months. If you think this is way too ridiculous, why do football players get together and cheer themselves up before the launch of a game? It is what gets them going. Same should apply to you. It helps with your subconscious to ""remind"" yourself of those rules. Now, that you have that list of rules. Look at it for 30 minutes. Yes. Just do it right now. Look at it for 30 minutes and tell me what is happening. ... ... 5-minutes go by.....10 minutes go by....20 minutes go by....30 minutes go by. Yep, so? what happened in that time? You'll tell me, that you looked at the list for 30 minutes as asked...but nothing really happened. Exactly. Nothing happened. You see? That list does not change. It is always there. It doesn't think, hope, pray, wish, deny. It has no emotions. YOU as a trader need to be in sync with that list. You're the one full of emotions. You're the one who enters a trade NOT following your pre-defined rules. You need to work on that. It's a constant daily battle, but again like I said. READ IT EVERY MORNING. Not so ridiculous now, is it? :) The sooner you realize to trade what you wrote down for yourself, and that you do exactly as you wrote it out, the better you'll get every day. Form habits. It takes 30-40 times to do something over and over to make something turn into a habit. Let habits do the trading for you. Less to no emotion involved. You're already used to it. Just like driving a car (yes, I'm talking to all those people that make their hair, talk on the phone in one hand, eat a taco in the other and still manage to avoid an accident...how did you do it? Because driving has already turned into a habit for you naturally. You've done it over and over that you no longer think about it. Let trading do the same for you. Trade off your list, read it every morning. Make it automatic.

**- Stop loss:** Everyone has different risk tolerance. We all are in agreement on that. You, as a trader, should always have a stop loss rule. Some do not believe in themselves to do it manually or on their own, so they rely heavily on the trading platform to do it for them aka a hard stop loss order (hopefully limit order). That is fine. I personally do not use or set stop losses because I make myself get out of a trade. By understanding money/risk management BEFORE I enter a trade, I am aware of where I will get out of the trade. I focus mainly on candles forming in front of my eyes when/once I'm in the trade and act accordingly. I also have a time stop loss rule limit. If I am in the trade for way more than say 20-30 minutes, I really have to reassess if it even makes sense to hold on, or whether I just cut the trade no matter if in profit or at loss. I make myself get out automatically because I WANT ANOTHER (BETTER) TRADING OPPORTUNITY. I rather lose $300 in 4 minutes, than over 6 hours if you know what I mean, because I could have perhaps traded 3 more other trades within all that time each netting me a profit of $150, which means I would have been up +$150. Get the idea now about why you should always embrace to accept losing trades? Get out if the trade goes against you. SMILE. Look for another opportunity. Don't let 1 single trade define you who you are as a trader. If you're a fisherman, you cast your net out for some fish. If after 10 minutes you don't get any single reaction on your net, you don't sit there for 6 hours waiting...you simply take the net back, and re-cast it out again at another location. Will the fisherman dwell on the fact that he just wasted 10 minutes? No, he wants to hurry and get to the next spot so he can catch BIGGER, better tasting fish because this net just now had NONE...

Phew. Lots of typing, but I think and hope it helps some of you out there to perhaps look at trading in a different perspective and improve on it consistently. Trading is a life-long skill. Improve on it daily. It's actually quite fun and boring at times, but that's the job of this activity in my opinion.

**Cash out winners**

When you make 2k shorting nflx earnings take that money and buy the family a vacation.

Rolling it into some payc short puts is *not* cashing out, money is still at risk even if it's solid play.

**Wrong Timeframe Options**

Being long directional spreads that expire in day or 2 worked. Being long with 7 to 20 days not so much.

Short 45 to 20 days was relatively successful as we've discussed here. However it's pain to monitor all of these

**Second guessing myself**

Had lots of great trades but would be conservative about 100$ cause losing 1000$ somewhere else.

Turning on private mode to mask that really helped

**Thinking it cannot get that low**

Never say that it cannot break X support. I started Oct thinking that Nasdaq at 7000 was improbable

Or look at amzn which has lost 20-odd% in same period.

**Watch the vix**

When vix up your portfolio should be more short premium, when vix down more directional.

Hence: Get paid where yield is paying.

**Not looking at correlations**

Speaking of amzn and Nas.. why was I long both at same time? That's completely irrational.

You get so caught up in managing this and that you lose track of big picture. Amazon was driving Nas so they were in lock step / doubling bets.

**Not abandoning losers faster**

TT is big into rolling forever, but if your on wrong side just get out of the way.

FB is great example instead of rolling, swapping sides and following the clear trend would have paid of thrice.

**Stops to tight**

When vix is 8 tight stops work, at 20+ they get blown out too fast. 

Static delta with stops are for bots, button clickers like myself need options as they move slow enough we can keep up

**Earnings Plays**

Sold a 5 delta strangle on CMG.. 95% chance worthless for 2$. After a week that was about 80$ under water.

Only takes one or two to blow a lot of gains.

**Not looking at the profile**

ES is up 25 points before open so we're going up right? Naw it requires volume and the first 30 minutes tells us conviction.

Don't trade that period use it to setup alerts and see where futures are pointed instead. Jumping the gun saved 2 ticks at cost of 10

**Theta burn is not a core position**

It's yield enhancement you put on core. A pure delta zero is mentally taxing and not possible for us mere mortals.

**Gamma vs Theta**

Theta is seller asking how much pain you'll take. Gamma is buyers version of this question.

Delta neutral positions with high gamma quickly becomes high delta positions which become hosed too quickly

Know up front if you can bag hold or this is rude awakening. Cost to carry is real not just something our economy textbook say.

**Never buying options**

On that note never buying options was point of pride but that's irrational. 

If a 5$ put spread is 1$ as buyer it's only worthless if my core position wins.. at which point I don't care.

Why don't I have more of them? Oh yeah cause I'm cheap.

**Your over leveraged if cannot take day off*""

If I took a day off, my portfolio would tank 10k. There was always something expire or needing adjustment.

This is unsustainable in retail account and requires automation, etc.

**Over diversification is as bad as no diversification**

Periods that focused on a small number of markets out performed periods where I had trades everywhere.

A lot of this is perhaps attributed to forcing trades that weren't there. 

If bored open paper account or on demand mode/replay the past.

**Debit vs Deposit vs Credit**

Debit is terrible and hard to get behind but if you think of a debit as deposit.. then there's some psychology mumbo-jumbo why I'm fine with it.

Credits are on surface better as I ""haven't given up anything"" I'm still as ""whole.""

That's missing the intangible portion of `obligation to` that comes with selling options.

**Options without PM margin is suckers game**

This is way to hard unless you can eg. buy 500 spy shares and barely impact buying power.

RegT is one hand tied behind back while the bookie kicks you in nuts. The span style just makes life easier

**For f# sake if cnbc/wsb is talking about your trade get out**

Seriously.

972,AMZN Trade Retrospective: Collecting a $.37 Credit for the Potential to Make Another $50,,243,j4jvi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j4jvi7/amzn_trade_retrospective_collecting_a_37_credit/,1601748827.0,"There are different ways to trade in a choppy environment. Here’s a deep dive on how I attempted to use weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and collected $.37 initially, for the possibility of making $50 more, even though the trade ended up being only an $.81 winner.

# The Entry

Last Thursday, 9/24, when $AMZN was trading at about $3000 a share, I was looking for a cheap way to play a bounce in the stock. During that time, my bias in the markets had begun to shift to a more bullish stance after seeing how the market had difficulty grinding lower. With that in mind, I wanted to play a potential bounce in tech. But I knew I didn’t want to pay a debit at all to play for a bounce that might not even happen, given how uncertain and choppy the markets had been, but I still wanted to set myself up to capture some large gains if AMZN did indeed bounce. Therefore, the strategy that made the most sense to me, was a Call broken wing butterfly.

Given that I’m a very short-term options trader who loves trading weeklies, I was trying to look for a cheap butterfly for the upcoming week that I could put on for a net credit. After exploring the options chain, I came across the +1/-2/+1 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for the Oct 2 series. This fly, at the time (on Sept 24), was trading for a total of $.37 credit. Meaning, by putting on that butterfly, I would get paid $.37, and the following scenarios could happen:

1. If AMZN decided to tank or hang out sideways and never get up close enough to the butterfly to expand the spread in my favor, then I’d walk away pocketing the $.37 credit
2. If AMZN slowly crept up to reach exactly 3350 by expiration, I’d not only get to keep the credit, but also be able to sell the butterfly back out for $50. Of course, it doesn’t need to reach exactly 3350 by expiration. If AMZN slowly worked its way up to near 3300, then the butterfly would expand very nicely as well.
3. If AMZN blew past 3400 by expiration, I’d see a loss, up to a maximum of $50 / spread (if $AMZN moves past 3450). That’s because the 3300/3350 long call vertical of the fly provides 50 points of coverage before I essentially start losing money from the 3350/3450 short vertical, up until that 3450 kicks in to cap off further upside losses.

So that is a rough outline of the potential scenarios that would happen with this trade.

Given the choppy market conditions, I was ok with risking $50/spread (point #3), in order to not lose money if I’m wrong on direction (point #1), while at the same time, keeping myself open to the possibility of the butterfly expanding in my favor (point #2) for some potentially very large gains.

But satisfying point #3 is tricky. I needed more data points suggesting that $AMZN wouldn’t surge higher early on in the trade. Because if $AMZN did surge higher early on in the trade, then while the 3300 long call would rise in value, those two 3350 short calls would also rise in value, and because there’d still be some time value left, they could be very juiced up and eat away at the profits of that 3300 long call, so much so that the 3450 long call won’t even be able to offset those losses, especially given how far out of the money that 3450 call is.

&#x200B;

Looking at the chart above on 9/24, we can see that AMZN was trading at around $3000/share. In order to reach $3300 (where the first long call of the broken wing butterfly is), the stock would need to

1. Breach the 38% fib retracement (\~AMZN=3131) of the move from the 9/2 high to the 9/21 low,
2. Breach the 20MA and 50MA
3. Breach the 50% fib retracement (\~AMZN=3211)
4. Breach the 61.8% fib retracement (\~AMZN=3292)

before finally reaching the 3300 long call. All of these levels, I felt, should provide some resistance for AMZN to have to chew thru over the following week, before it even gets to the long call. And by that time, if AMZN did reach 3300, then the 3300 long call would still have a lot of extrinsic value left (somewhere around $20 on the last day), while the 3350 short calls would be very cheap (each around $5), so the entire spread could be roughly worth $10. Which would be great, because that means I’d be getting paid $.37 to make another $10.

So with all of the above considered, I chose to take on that upside risk, for a chance to make potentially $50 (realistically I try to aim for just half of the max profit: $25, and start harvesting profits and peeling off the flies at around $5-$10), and that day on 9/24, entered the Oct2 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for a $.37 credit.

After entry, on Friday 9/25 and Monday 9/28, AMZN made steady progress upwards, from 3000 to 3175, breaching the 31.8% retracement and tagging the 20MA and 50MA from below.

but this move wasn’t large and fast enough to expand the value of the 3350 short calls. In fact, theta did a great job draining those short calls, while the 3300 long call did a good job retaining its premium, so the butterfly had already expanded a bit in my favor, and I was sitting at about a small $1.00 profit.

# The Adjustment

However, on Tuesday and Wednesday, AMZN began to stall out. By the end of Wednesday 9/30, when it looked like AMZN was putting in a topping tail, I decided that AMZN might not be able to make it near 3300 by expiration Friday, so I wanted to take in a bit more credit while I still could, before theta drained more of that 3300 long call. At the time, the spread was trading for almost $2.

That’s when I made a slight adjustment to the spread and sold the 3300/3310 call vertical.

&#x200B;

[AMZN on 9\/30, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/mvsrotaj6xq51.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2642107f30c304964a59d5dc24ea636622e52a)

This essentially rolled the 3300 long call up to 3310, and I was able to collect a small $.44 credit for it. However, this adjustment did open me up to an additional $10 of risk to the upside, because now, the long call vertical portion of the butterfly is only $40 wide (instead of $50). Still, with only 2 days left for AMZN to go higher, I felt comfortable taking on a bit more upside risk knowing that theta is going to be working hard to drain those 3350 short calls if AMZN did decide to surge higher. And at that moment, I actually wanted AMZN to move more towards my fly. My deltas were still positive, and the risk graph showed that a move towards the short strikes of the fly would expand it by another $4-5 by Thursday.

So after this adjustment, the trade stood at a $.81 credit, and the profit potential on the fly was now $40 instead of $50. Which is still pretty good.

# The Tease

On Thursday, AMZN showed some strength and closed above the 50% fib (3211), which meant that if on Friday, AMZN worked its way up to around 3300, the fly could potentially be worth $5-10. Things were looking good (on any continued bullishness, the next target for AMZN was the 61.8% fib retracement at \~3300). So I left the trade alone without making any more adjustments.

# The Flop

Unfortunately, on Thursday night, news broke out that Trump was diagnosed with Coronavirus, and the market fell lower. By the open, AMZN was already trading at around 3150, roughly 150 points below the fly. The spread had instantly lost all of its value, so I basically let it expire worthless and walked away pocketing the $.81 credit.

While the trade did not work out as well as I had liked, the important thing to note is that I was able to get paid even when the trade didn’t go in my favor. With options, there are ways to trade an underlying to a certain target without ponying up a debit, albeit at the cost of introducing tail risk, while offering the possibility of very large upside. This may be a style of trading that one can consider employing when the outlook of the markets is uncertain, as long as the trader is willing to make the necessary adjustments to control risk.

Which leads me to the following section:

# FAQ

>What if AMZN decided to surge very early on during the trade? What if AMZN had surged to 3300 with 4-5 DTE, hence juicing up the short calls and causing the butterfly to take on large negative deltas?

Even though the position would be very theta positive, I would pony up the debit to cap off the upside risk by buying the 3400/3450 call vertical, hence turning the 3300/3350/3450 broken wing butterfly into the 3300/3350/3400 balanced butterfly. From there on out until expiration, I would look for ways to reduce the debit incurred from that adjustment.

&#x200B;

>But what if AMZN tanked afterwards? You could end up getting whipsawed.

I’d rather be safe than sorry and make the necessary adjustments to avoid getting run over, because I don’t like playing the hope card. I could always undo the adjustment and look for ways to collect back more credit (at the cost of introducing risk elsewhere), depending on my new directional bias on AMZN at the time.

&#x200B;

>Your maximum loss is so large, $5000. I’d never make that bet, I would never risk $5000 to make $5000.

This style of trading is not for everyone. There are different ways to perceive risk. I don't really think of risk as binary as “max gain vs max loss”. If the trade goes against me, I’m not going to open myself up to the possibility of eating the maximum loss. I’m going to manage that risk and make sure that I don’t lose any money at all on the trade. Basically, I’m not going to just put on the trade, walk away to the prayer room, and come back at expiration and hope that AMZN expired at 3350.

&#x200B;

>Why not just join thetagang and slap on iron condors / credit spreads in this environment? You could’ve collected more credit by selling a 50 point wide put vertical with your bounce thesis.

Different traders have different styles. I personally don’t like pure premium selling strategies. I’d rather have long options in front of the shorts to open myself up for some large upside and convexity in the P/L curve, rather than limit myself to the concavity of pure premium selling strategies. Having long options in front of the shorts also helps me sleep better at night.

It starts with determining where I stand versus the crowd and then helps me look at strikes and what my true view on volatility is, even when looking directionally. I use some examples within the post in SNAP (from today), less bullish than the crowd, more bullish, and ""the bulls and bears are both nuts"" and where to set strikes in call spreads, short put spreads, iron condors, and even analyzing risk in stock. It's a long post, excerpted here. 

TL;DR

The expected move is to options trades what the point spread is to a football bet. You wouldn't place a bet on a football game blind, without knowing who was favored and by how much.

Deeper Dive

Expected move (or implied move) is what the options market is pricing as the consensus potential move of a stock, in either direction, over a period of time. It is derived directly from options pricing and is a practical expression of implied volatility.

If implied volatility increases (based on net buying demand for calls and puts) the expected move increases. If implied volatility decreases (based on net selling of calls and puts) the expected move decreases.

The expected move is direct, and actionable expression of uncertainty. If a stock is about to report earnings, or about to announce trial results of a new drug, there is increased uncertainty of how the stock will react. Once that event passes, the expected move decreases, reflecting expectations of more certainty.

Actionable Insights

Aside from the immediate insight of actually seeing when options are pricing big moves, how else can I use the expected move? The expected move is the point at which at the money straddles breakeven. In other words, it is the line at which options are either overpriced, or underpriced, just like the point spread in a football game. If you are buying options and looking for a move higher, you need it to not just move higher, but a certain magnitude higher. Just as if you bet even money on the Ravens as favorites to beat the Steelers, you need the Ravens to win by a certain amount, not just win.

The expected move should be incorporated into all new trades (including stock) to assess risk/reward and specifically in options trades, to help with strike selection.

This isn't crapping on new traders, but I promise it's in your interests to understand these basics 100% as you can then answer questions like how a trade is entered, risk profile, etc yourself.  There's no match for reading and paper trading as well.

An option is a **contract** concerning the sale of 100 shares of an underlying equity.  You can be long or short, ie., buy or sell options.  A buyer's max risk is ALWAYS the initial debit paid.  A seller's max risk is ALWAYS either unlimited on calls while for puts, the max risk is when an equity falls to zero dollars, essentially meaning the strike price x 100 x # contracts.   You can limit risk with spreads and other multi leg trades, which you'll learn about as you continue.

The contract (option) for a call essentially says: The buyer is purchasing the right to buy 100 shares (per contract) of the underlying equity at the strike price, paying what is called the premium - essentially the price per underlying share of the option, so for each option the debit will be 100 x the premium.  They are not obligated to buy these shares, and most traders don't exercise options, they sell them back (see opening/closing trades), hopefully at a profit, and move on.  Generally speaking, a retail trader never wants to exercise options, unless they believe the equity they'd buy at the strike price would be worth more on Monday.  Most prefer to limit exposure and close out options - I've never exercised an option.

The call seller is getting an initial credit for agreeing to selling the OBLIGATION to sell 100 shares at the strike price - regardless of the market price - and may or may not actually own said shares, aka covered calls vs naked calls.

The situation is the same but opposite with puts: the buyer of a put is buying the right to SELL 100 shares of an equity at the strike price - ie, if $XYZ is at $300 and you have 500 shares, you might buy 5 puts at a $280 strike as *insurance*.  If $XYZ falls to $5, you can then still get $280 per share.   Don't think 0 is the goal though - sometimes a complete bankruptcy and halt of trading can make puts worthless.

A put seller can sell cash-secured (covered) puts or sell naked puts, which means they're receiving an initial credit to agree to BUY the underlying at the strike price if it falls below.

Note: Buyers have the RIGHT, Sellers have an OBLIGATION.  Buyers can in theory choose not to exercise an option, or sell at a stop loss point, if they want.  Sellers MUST sell or buy shares unless they close out the position.

Commonly confused are: Buy to close, Sell to close, Buy to open, Sell to open.  

If you're buying a call, you are buying to open a new position that didn't exist.  If you're buying BACK a call because you initially sold (an open position), you're buying to CLOSE.  You cannot buy or sell to close a position that isn't open.    Selling options is selling to open.

This is basic, I know, but new traders make sure this all makes sense to you please.

For those getting into spreads, shorts, etc:

No matter your broker, when you sell options you have a negative quantity (hence buying back a positive quantity to close), and when you buy / are long you have a positive quantity.

Ex 1: I hold 1000 shares of $XYZ, so I can sell 10 covered calls.  Say premium is $2.50 at a $100C strike for 5/15, so I get 2.5 x 100 = 250 x 10 = 2500.  I now have -10 XYZ20200515 100C's, which is how you'll see it listed, aka, -10 $100 strike calls on XYZ expiring on 5/15/20.

Let's say on 5/14 XYZ is at $99.50; but with one day left the premium is only $1.00.  I can BUY + 10 contracts, realizing a $150 gain per or $1500 total, if I'm worried it'll be up on Friday.   My max gain is the $2500 - which is when the $100 calls expire worthless.

Briefly about spreads: They limit risk by having short and long ""ends"" to cover big movements.  You don't need naked options permissions though, just to be able to sell covered calls / puts generally.

In a debit spread, I might buy a $120 call on XYZ while simultaneously selling a $130 call; So I have +1 120C and -1 130C.  The long ""covers"" the short and minimizes risk, and requires an initial debit.  In a credit spread, I might sell the $120 and buy the $130 to receive an initial credit, if XYZ is at 125 in both cases.

With the current state of the “kangaroo” market, swing trading has become increasingly difficult. I found myself losing money here and there and realized it was time to adapt and start day trading and riding momentum. As an avid fan of ketamine, I stumbled upon a technical indicator called “Pring’s Special K.” What is this, you ask?

Martin J. Pring is an OG in the game. He’s been in in the markets since 1969 (haha). He founded his own research company in 1981 and has been killing it since then. He’s written several books about TA, market psychology, and even a karma sutra.

What Mr. Pring also did was create his own technical indicator (badass) – called Pring’s Special K. It’s available on the Yahoo Finance chart. I initially started looking it as a meme because of it’s name, however this thing is literally a god send. It is a momentum indicator that combines short, intermediate, and long-term velocity into one series. Essentially, it shows true summed cyclicality. Whatever, who cares. How do I use it? 0DTE’s.

Now while we are in a current kangaroo market, you have to ride the momentum when trading, hence- we use Pring’s! 

Since I found out about it a month or two ago, I’ve been doing 0DTE’s on SPY almost every M/W/F. I watch the 1M and 1 DAY chart with Pring’s listed at the bottom. I wait till around ~1030, maybe a little later, depends what the market is doing. I like to use it when the market seems indecisive and it’s leading into power hour. For example, yesterday Pring’s was showing flat for 10-15 minutes around 2:30 EST then it started to curve up. I immediately loaded up on 323c 0DTE calls @.61 x10. We all saw what happened end of day yesterday. I was doubled up in about 20 minutes and unloaded half, at 1.2ish, and held the other 5 until 2.2. I could’ve kept holding for a finish at around 327, but I am notoriously paper handed.

This does fall into a con on Pring’s Special K – he doesn’t just pop out and say “sell now.” I tweeted him about adding that feature, we will see.

Anyway, I have been using this religiously for about a month, and it has only failed me once. I am roughly batting 15 for 16 with it. All of the trades have been ~60% or higher, several 2x and 3x.  I encourage you all to give it a try. I know this sounds dumb and memey, which it is…but it really works. Obviously use some of your own knowledge and judgement. I realize now this won’t be applicable to those who use RH and don’t have 0DTE’s, but it can work for 1DTE as well just won’t have the same returns. Set stop losses accordingly and make sure your paying attention.

Good Luck.

Below are some reflections and lessons learned regarding my adventure down the options path. When I started in 2015 interest rates were basically zero; today I'm flattening what positions I have open and moving my ""mad money"" (obligatory Jim Cramer is a faggot) all to IG bonds and USTs. 3% a year is better than what I've gotten for the past few years.

I started in mid 2015 with just under $15,000. When I started this journey I made a mental stop that I would flatten and get out if I ever drew down by 50% - that was my hard limit. I will probably be back at some point in the future but for the near-term I have other things in life to focus on: career, family, friends, personal growth, and so on. 

My introduction to the world of options came very early on from the TastyTrade crew, like many on this sub. I still maintain all these years later that I have never learned more in 2 years about anything than I have about finance from Tastytrade. I appreciate their research, their content, and their desire to make this world better for you & me despite having lost money trading options ""a la TastyTrade"". I don't believe that my individual performance reflects negatively on the content and product they create.

I didn't know the intricacies of what I was doing - just that ""Iron Condors are good and you should sell them"". Thinking I am a genius and stumbled upon a winner I just kept doing what was working most of the way thru 2016. I had some up months and some down months, but the essence of my strategy was simply to put on defined risk spreads with >50% POP and hope for the best. 

Knowing that the 2016 election was going to be a shitshow miles in advance, and also knowing that the P/E multiple was historically high, I was among the crowd that expected a big drop in the markets given a Trump election. Well, I was very wrong, and experienced my first series of bad trades: I bought put verticals on the equity indexes ahead of the election, entering positions way too big for my account size, and had my lunch during the ""Trump Bump"". I went into 2017 with a loss on my portfolio, down to ~$11,000. 

We probably all remember the markets of 2017. Ultra-compressed volatility, very slow grind upwards on little volume or news why. ""don't fight the fed"", ""buybacks"", whatever. It doesn't matter the ""why"". I was still selling Iron Condors every month, and battling the ITM call sides like clockwork. I would have had a more enjoyable time blowing that money at the strip club. By summertime I decided that that wasn't working anymore, so I dove deeper into ""strategies"" - still defined risk, but complex spread strategies that were a) too big for my account still and b) more complex than necessary anyway. Think Broken-Wing Butterflies, Diagonal Spreads, etc. Pick a few losers and be wrong about volatility expanding (it didn't all year) and you've got the recipe for another big draw-down. 

I said ""fuck it"" and joined the long-only crowd about Thanksgiving 2017, and combined with my lucky pick on being short UST's since around then I didn't have the worst year in 2017. Down small. At the end of the year I decided that what I was doing generally wasn't working - that spread trading was essentially a zero-sum game and that if I was going to make any money trading options, it had to be naked. So as you can see the motif by now, I was right but for the wrong reasons. 

I started 2018 long equity deltas and short bond deltas, with about $10,000. Thru January so-far-so-good. Volmageddon happened, but I wasn't hurt too too bad as my positions were defined-risk debit call spreads (or put spreads on TLT). I took this opportunity to get into naked options via the Sector Spider ETFs. Sold some straddles, some naked puts, etc. Feb-April and did okay, maybe broke even. However, I was still trading too big: I'd have 4 winners get wiped out by 1 loser and have to start over again a month later. Notable bad trades include short call in XLI at the second of the double-bottom in march, and the call side of short straddles in metals and oil. 

Combine those run-of-the-mill bad trades with a bad earnings play in AAPL, and losing my shirt on SLV, GLD and XOP this week brings me to $7,000 almost on the dot. So I flattened today. Being wrong = being wrong no matter how right you think you should be. 

I'll be back (probably) at some point but for now I'm just doing a 1-lot covered call on TLT while holding shares in the meantime. 3% APY paid monthly is better than I've done so far in my options trading career. Getting some extra juice from the short calls as interest rates continue to rise isn't so bad either. In the meantime, I've learned a ton not just about finance, but about myself and about decision making. TastyTrade doesn't promise success in trading options, but they maintain that you'll learn a lot about making decisions and about statistics. I can say for certain that that has been the case for me. I've re-ignited a desire for learning and knowledge I haven't had in over a decade - for that I'm grateful. 

Takeaways from the last ~2 years:
- Trade your account size, not your ambition. Many (most?) of my losing trades would have been less lose-y or even profitable had I held to expiration. I flattened out of trades going against me too early many times because the losses were unacceptable.

- Don't touch positions once you put them on. Rolling up/down/into anything 99.9% of the time results in the same position for a worse price. In other words: let's say you sold a strangle for $1.00. Your call gets tested, so you roll the put up to a straddle for an additional $1.00. Well the elephant in the room is that that straddle's market price today (ignoring your current positions) is $3.00 - you basically got paid $2.00 for a $3.00 straddle. Now you're in it to expiry for sure you stupid idiot.

- Spreads trade nothing like naked options. Naked short options are almost always paying you extrinsic value via theta as time elapses, whereas an underwater credit spread can result in extrinsic value and theta working against you. Holding underwater (theta against you) credit spreads in my experience does not yield results - better to close and re-deploy. 

- Static delta is nothing like dynamic delta. My biggest mistake (other than trade size) was thinking of delta as one thing, as opposed to thinking of static and dynamic delta as two separate beasts. Because my account is so small I couldn't really take any significant static positions in any underlyings; adding or subtracting ""some delta"" to get more or less flat via spreads does not work. Markets move - your dynamic delta moves too. 

- Have core positions. This ties into the point above, but having an idea of ""what to do"" with options is much easier when you already have a core position. Too often I didn't know ""what to do"" but instead of doing nothing i ""went neutral"" via an IC or similar. OPTIONS ARE NOT CORE POSITIONS (except synthetic longs/shorts) - the deltas change and can change rapidly as markets move.

- Duration is your friend. Every time I decided to get cute and trade options with <7 DTE I got burned. I'd win a few small spreads to get some confidence and then give it all back on a spread moving against me. 
- As always , the standard advice applies: Trade small, keep a journal, have an opinion, have a plan. 

Anyway guys thanks for everything. I've had a good time and other than stress my life hasn't been impacted negatively by trading options. All told I still feel like I got out ahead - I paid a little over 7 grand for 2 years' of knowledge, experience, community, passion, and an interesting hobby and hopefully career someday. That's still a better deal than the local university. ",options
983,Do NOT buy Quantumscape (QS) - unless you just want to gamble with -EV,,233,khtrw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/khtrw3/do_not_buy_quantumscape_qs_unless_you_just_want/,1608595949.0,"Ok so this post mirrors my post from almost 6 months ago when I posted about Hertz the day it reached its top of 6+ dollars after already announcing bankruptcy (it went from like 50 cents to 6+ dollars). You can see my submitted post history for that. Since this is an r/options post, I'll talk about something that rarely anyone ever talks about but impacts options pricing - the borrow rate - so that it's an informative post too even if you aren't interested in QS. 

For the record I'm posting this as QS is 105 AH 12/21 so I can look back in 3-6 months. First, I'm not short QS so I don't want to hear some comment below saying you are just desperate because you are taking a huge loss. I'm posting this as a warning/advice just like when I posted about Hertz because at this point it's actually extremely negative expected value (EV) to go long QS through call options/shares. 

First the IV is ridiculously high. There could be many situations that play out in which you can buy calls, it goes up 10%, and you will end up down. Second, one of the reasons for why anyone would buy QS is to collect the borrow rate, which is insane. However, most brokers don't give the customer this borrow or if they do, don't give the full borrow. For RH, you get none of this borrow, so this alone makes this very -EV at these price points. Finally, the most obvious reason, it's quite clear this stock is overvalued as it won't even have any revenue or sales for a few years. It's similar to NKLA actually (look at that chart when it briefly hit 90 earlier this year). 

The stock is undergoing a short squeeze with high borrow rates, which is causing this spike, but historically these stop pretty fast and when it pulls back, all those calls/shares will lose value. There's like plenty of examples of this just this year, and the goal is obviously not to buy at the top. The main issue is also when it pulls back, it doesn't usually EVER bounce back up. See the NKLA bagholders at 90, HTZ bagholders at 6, KODK bagholders at 55, etc. 

In the case you just wanted to just gamble, it's actually not a bad stock to purely gamble. However, there are plenty of better gambles out there that should return a higher expected return. Second, gambling is fine but we all know what happens when you play roulette in the long run. Sure you can hit that 23 number you bet on, but the more you push it, the quicker all of that goes away. So that's why this is a fair warning. You can gamble and you might win even for a short time period, but most will be left holding the bag. And when they hold the bag, they hold it all the way down. 

I also wouldn't outright short this right now unless you want to sell a long dated call spread/naked OTM long-dated call. As I mentioned, the IV and borrow are extremely high, so a short term long puts strategy will have an extremely tough time printing. Furthermore, it's somewhat hard to short the stock with this high borrow, and that borrow is embedded in puts too. However, longer term, it's clearly a short at these levels, but you have to do it in some more unique ways as I mentioned above. 

Finally, if QS spikes up from this 105 AH number, I guarantee you there will be some idiots who are gonna be posting here in the comments section about how they were right/I was wrong (see the HTZ comments). I'm ok with that. That means I didn't call the top exactly perfectly, but as I said, you can revisit this post in 3-6 months. Ironically on HTZ, the day after I posted, it did actually go up that day (to 6+), got a lot of shit comments, and I'm sure 100% of those guys lost money since it has never even seen anywhere close to that price ever again as the next day was the top. So same situation here. Just a fair warning. If anything, at least you learned how borrow rates affect options pricing and short positions.",options

>""SPX / SPY options $Delta remains historically  very high at 94th percentile (since 2013) and with QQQ $Delta even more  “extreme” over 97th percentile, which could now matter given that this  week’s expiration should see a TON of Gamma rolling-off—meaning that as  Dealer $Gamma hedging requirements are set to drop precipitously (with  so much coming-off after Friday’s expiration) that we could see a  powerful “unclenching” and thus, potential for a much larger trading  distribution thereafter""

To quickly explain gamma's effect on the overall market, imagine two soccers goalie on opposite ends of the field, knocking the ball back towards the midfield line, while coming in towards midfield by the end of the game (with increasing speed as the game was about to end).

That's what happening behind the scenes of the market. Dealer/market makers (who trade delta neutral) are loaded up with a lot of gamma (long calls and puts) into this expiration. As the market goes higher, they have shares to sell. As the market goes lower, they have shares to buy. That's one  big reason for the lack of volatility in the broader markets the past 2  weeks and why its moves seem to be getting more and more narrow. Here's  the SPY expected move chart for the next 2 months via Options AI  technology:

[*SPY expected move chart*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/2020-08-20-12-49-24.2020-08-20-12_50_39.gif)

Options have compressed to the point where the expected move over the next month in SPY is only \~3.5%. And the expected move into the end of  August just \~1.7%.

That is not atypical following periods of elevated volatility. As the VIX comes in from elevated levels like we saw this Spring and Summer, panic selling of options can ensue and many trading books get overloaded with gamma. (Trust me, I was a market maker. After the VIX is 80 and now 20, and you've been getting long vol/gamma since 30... 20 can feel like the end of the world, like 80 felt when you're short gamma)

But what about stocks like Tesla which are still moving wildly?  There's something else at play there, the market is seeing serious reverse skew in some of the story stocks, with upside call buying creating air pockets of negative gamma as the stocks go higher. (typical skew in options is more expensive downside puts and less expensive upside calls, retail demand in a stock like TSLA is causing it to flip, where upside calls price 'crashes higher')

Here's a comparison of Tesla expected move vs the QQQ and SPY over the next month (impressive considering TSLA is now $2000 vs SPY and QQQ \~$300:

[*TSLA vs SPY vs QQQ expected move chart*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-1.02.21-PM.png)

A stock like Tesla has a very different gamma profile as dealers/market makers have to buy stock as it goes higher to cover deltas of the call strikes they are short.

The thing that ties both of these aspects of the options market together, SPX gamma and TSLA's reverse skew... is that there isn't much demand for puts in either case. 

Therefore, If you were looking for a moment to look the other way in the market, either outright or as a hedge, downside is as cheap as we've seen since the beginning of the year.

For instance, here's a bearish price target, into October expiration in the SPY:

*Bearish price target* [*trade comparison*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/2020-08-20-13-14-29.2020-08-20-13_16_24.gif)

The long +338/-321 put spread to the expected move is extremely reasonable at around $4.50

Here it is on the chart [\+338/-321 ps](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-1.15.17-PM.png)

The breakeven on that trade is around $333.50 and it is profitable down to $321 in the stock with a nearly 3 to 1 payout. 

There's no guarantee what happens next in the market and what we've seen could continue (to re-appropriate a line: it can be boring for a lot longer than gamma can stay solvent). But some aspects of the options market are affecting both the market itself as well as providing an opportunity in case things suddenly shift.

The gamma is the overall market expiring today as well as the lack of demand for puts overall is allowing for some really inexpensive put spreads over the next few months.",options

I'll be working on being able to filter all the data whether or not it's classified as ""unusual"" and also by volume to open interest. This will be big to scan through unusual activity easier.

**Summary**

Markets ripped higher at the open, does it make sense? Probably not. Many companies are already at record valuations if we look at historical price to earnings. Regardless, stonks only go up. Here’s Swaggy with some summarized option flow and unusual options activity. Let’s get started so I can appreciate this bottle of red on a Wednesday night.

**BABA – Alibaba Holdings**

I mentioned this stock in my previous post. The two weeks leading up to it’s breakout there was some big call activity accumulating. The stock has exploded recently to new highs and nothing can stop it. Today was nothing unusual except the volume of calls that was being traded. For reference, Monday’s call flow was running at 20x average volume, today’s volume matched that and then some, truly remarkable stuff. My algorithm caught nearly $225 million in bullish options activity activity. Last week the average was $15-20 million. What gives? BABA had very strong earnings last Q and they just announced expansion in China. Overall China is the next super-power economic force next to the great USA.

**TWTR – Twitter Inc**

Twitter opened strong for the day on news that a subscription feature allowing users to host subscription services will soon be revealed. TWTR saw approximately $32 million in bullish flow, according to my tool going above and beyond any unusual flow leading up to that. Some of the bigger positions were in the millions of premium and between 5k-20k contracts a piece. BIG FLOW.

https://preview.redd.it/r09eap61bq951.png?width=2962&format=png&auto=webp&s=50ff7dc978452e1f92cbe91b2ea173473699a77c

**SNAP – Snap Inc**

Option flow in SNAP was running at approximately 20x normal volume for the day. Rumors of Snap’s rival, TikTok, getting banned across the United States gave this stock a boost. I saw some bullish flow outweighed bearish flow by about 1.5 to 1.

**FEYE – FireEye**

I caught only 1 trade today in the FEYE ticker. Recently, this stock hasn’t seen too much action so this buy definitely stood out as unusually bullish. A player opened 3,700 July 31st calls at the $13 strike for $200k in premium. The strike price is approximately 8% OTM and they are gambling on a relatively big move to the upside in the short-term. I’ll be keeping my eye on this one and might get in on a dip tomorrow.

**DDOG – Datadog Inc**

Bullish flow just keeps coming in this thorough-bred ticker. The stock has already seen a meteoric rise of nearly 45% in the last 3 weeks. Today looks like call buyers continued the sweep in the $100/$105 strike prices. These are all short-term positions so could possibly the players closing previous positions and rolling out some of the profits in hopes to ride the momentum.

**JD – JD.com**

This ticker saw an absolutely colossal long call position opened today. 25k September call contracts opened for a roughly $40 million position. The strike price was about 20% in the money at the $50 strike (stock is now $65).

990,Proper use of Options for Leverage (Teaching Segment),,234,fkfi8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fkfi8r/proper_use_of_options_for_leverage_teaching/,1584488026.0,"I wouldn’t mess with leveraged ETFs.  I have seen too many people talking about the use of options on leveraged ETFs.  Options are leverage.  Leverage on top of leverage makes things even more volatile and ultimately, more difficult for you to be a long term successful options trader.  If I was looking for leverage what would I do?  


I’d focus on small cap indexes for that extra volatility. Look at iShares Russell 2000 (IWM).

Looking at the option chain, I’d sell put spreads at the 105/100 level collect \~2.00 to risk 3.00. With duration until January 21, 2022.  (The higher you go up the chain 110/105 or 115/110 -> the more leverage you have)!

For $2,000 of cash you can sell 4 of these put spreads. $2000 is collateral - invest that in SHV or some secure short term treasury (you don’t want to lose this collateral or have it deteriorate in any way shape or form.)

(We sell the 105/100 for 2.00) You receive $800 for selling the 4 put spreads. Take the $800 and reinvest it into shares of IWM. You created leverage by yourself so there are no crazy expense ratios, plus there is no decay of the asset (which happens with levered ETFs). You’re short IV (volatility) while collecting a ton of theta as you wait. Instead of decaying with a levered fund, your “levered position” is taking in value everyday you wait by shorting implied vol.

Now if I bought IWM outright with $2,000 (19 shares at $105.25) if IWM rebounded to $165.25 I’d make $60 a share or $1,140.  A levered ETF could even return more, but also remember the decay part of the equation.

If I used options as explained above and if we rebounded to $165.25. I’d make $800 from the put spreads, interest on my collateral in SHV (let’s say $10). And I would have bought 7.60 shares of IWM ($60) gain = $456. Total it up I made $1,266. You gained 11% more by making homemade leverage using options in a very safe and conservative way without risking your shirt.  There is no expense on this leverage, you are actually gaining from theta. Imagine doing this with 10k or 100k. You can see how these gains can be very lucrative for limited risk given we have until January 21, 2022 for the trade to come to fruition.

I hope some people find this helpful and interesting, do not play with levered ETFs or the options that represent them.",options

Selling index options to buy single name options is a bet on correlation going lower. When correlation is high, all stocks move together with the macro tape and stock selection is less useful.  On the other hand, when correlation is low, some stocks  move up, while the others move down- giving lots of opportunities for alpha generation.

Makes sense post election and post covid vaccine. Useful statistic to watch...

Lots of comments on this, so just to clarify: This is the net across all option trades trades across the entire listed market yesterday. Not one single trade.

I was recently talking with someone about the concept of directionality and the fact that I pay attention to it but it's not my guiding factor for a trade. Reality is, I primarily trade short single options (calls or puts) because of the litany of adjustments available to them. You're not going to hit a home run with one, but I do continue to base hits - and in the long term thats what you need. 

I recently made a video outlining a really simple example of rolling a put that I established in April. I've applied the same approach through the drop the beginning of this year, and since I've started the strategy in 2010. Making sure we roll for a credit is one of the most important pieces. Trade allocation is probably the second most important piece - allowing the ability to scale in adding risk to reduce basis.

For example it labels ""No more stimmy pump ⛽?"" as bearish, ""shit, i keep looking for a dip in AI, but it looks like that's never happening"" as bullish and ""Fucking LAZR, gonna have my shares called away next month aren’t I?"" as bullish, even though these are not obvious if you just look for keywords.",options

Meanwhile, the entire country is sheltered indoors and COVID-19 is still exponentially growing, with US cases now surpassing China, with joblessness at a new record high. Furthermore, commercial real estate lenders that I have spoken with have never before seen the number of requests for loan remodification and payment deferral, and gross scheduled rent across all commercial assets is highly expected to declined come April 1st (with the exception of Single-Tenant Net Lease retail). With an impending mortgage crisis on the horizon and no end in sight to our shelter-in-place health-care strategy, how can the Trump Administration blatantly claim a market reversal? Are we dealing with complete incompetence at the WH or something more sinister? Is this a pump-and-dump on a global scale or are we really headed for greener pastures?

# Simple Option Calculator
A simple calculator that can run on the terminal for ease of input to calculate options trading scenarios

DISCLAIMER: THIS CALCULATOR DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADVICE, RECOMMENDATIONS, OR CLAIM TO PROVIDE ANY ACCURATE INFORMATION. THIS CALCULATOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES INCURRED  AND SHOULD BE USED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. BY DOWNLOADING AND RUNNING THIS PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO HAVE READ THIS DISCLAIMER AND ACCEPT TO USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

# How to use:
### Download Python 3
If you don't have Python 3 in your computer, download python 3 here https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### Running the program

Download the file and open it using python (right click and click on `open with...`)

## Functions 

### PD = Price Difference Calculator

Enter ""pd"" when prompted to use this calculator. The purpose of this calculator is to display profit/loss scenarios for various numbers of contracts bought. Upon typing 'pd' and pressing `enter`, it will ask the current price of the long call/put, then the price you hope to sell the long call/put. By pressing `enter`, it will execute and display the net profit/loss, cost of the trade, and the gross cost when selling for each number of contracts in `numcon_pd` (see settings below)

Example

    enter pd or pp pd
    What is the price of the option? 1.75
    What is the price you want get out 2.45
    1.0  contract(s). Profit $ 48.10  buy cost: $ 185.95 Sell Cost: $ 234.05
    2.0  contract(s). Profit $ 116.10  buy cost: $ 361.95 Sell Cost: $ 478.05
    4.0  contract(s). Profit $ 252.10  buy cost: $ 713.95 Sell Cost: $ 966.05
    10.0  contract(s). Profit $ 660.10  buy cost: $ 1769.95 Sell Cost: $ 2430.05

### PP = Profit Predictor 

Enter ""pp"" when prompted to use this calculator. The purpose of this is to display the price to sell the option to make a profit set in the `profit_goals` variable. It will ask the price of the option, how much you would want to make, and the number of contracts you plan to buy/own. Once executed, it will display the cost of the trade, the price to break even, the profit, and the price to sell the option.

Example

    enter pd or pp pp
    What is the price of the trade 1.75
    How much money do you want to make? 500
    How many contracts? 3
    The cost of this trade is $ 537.95
    To break even, sell at this price $ 1.836
    Sell at $ 3.50 to make $ 500
    Sell at $ 2.00 to make $ 50
    Sell at $ 2.17 to make $ 100
    Sell at $ 2.34 to make $ 150
    Sell at $ 2.50 to make $ 200

# Settings

To change the settings, simply open the python file in an IDE, code editor, or on Notepad(if you don't have any IDEs or code editors) and change the values. When changing the settings on Notepad, ensure that you save the file as a python file by adding "".py"" at the end of the file name. It is important you don't change any other code other than the settings to ensure it runs correctly and smoothly.


The only variables that can be changed in this program are `com_base`, `com_per`, `numcon_pd`, and `profit_goals`

**`com_base`** is the base commission for most brokers. If you're using robinhood, you can set this to 0.0.

**`com_per`** is the commission per contract most brokers charge. Current default setting is 1.0 for $1.00.

**`numcon_pd`** is a list of integers that represent the number of contracts in a scenario. So, if you are wondering how much an option trade would cost you and by how much a profit/loss would be depending on the amount of contracts you buy, the program will display and calculate it for you.

**`profit_goals`** is a list of integers that the program will use to calculate the price to sell the long option. For example, the current list is 50, 100, 150, and 200 therefore this program will use this list to calculate at what price to sell the long option to make $50, $100, $150, and $200.

1022,Selling Puts/Calls endlessly?,,215,hipriv,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hipriv/selling_putscalls_endlessly/,1593531743.0,"So let’s say I sell a put at a price I’m comfortable buying 100 shares of stock at...


If it doesn’t fall to that price, I keep the premium, cool.

If it does fall below, then I buy the stock at the price (let’s say 10 bucks a share)

If the actual price is 7.5, couldn’t I then start to collect premium by selling calls at 10 dollars a share?

And when the stock goes back to 10, I keep the premium from both sides of the transaction and walk away even on the stock?

It seems like I’m just collecting premium up and down, unless the company goes bankrupt or something.

How to Fight Amazon (Before You Turn 29): Lina Khan has a novel theory about monopolies—and her sights are set squarely on the company.

""About 44 cents of every dollar that Americans spend online go to Amazon.""    

""First, Khan says, Amazon has been willing “to sustain losses and invest aggressively at the expense of profits.” This isn’t a controversial assertion: Amazon has posted an annual profit for only 13 of the past 21 years""

""Second, Amazon is integrated vertically, across business lines. In addition to selling stuff online, Amazon now publishes books, extends credit, sells online ads, designs clothes, and produces movies and TV shows. It is also one of the world’s largest providers of cloud storage and computing power."" 

""These two practices—predatory pricing and integration across business lines—may sound normal. But under old readings of U.S. antitrust law, they are illegal.""

""And then, in 1978, a Yale Law professor named Robert Bork promoted a clean new theory of antitrust law, inspired by the libertarian Chicago school of economics. 
 Bork decreed that all antitrust suits should be judged by one question: What will most lower prices for consumers?""

""And predatory pricing? It is “a phenomenon that probably does not exist,” [Bork] wrote. The Chicago school, he said, had proved that companies would always pursue short-term profits over long-term growth.  Amazon’s history seems to belie this claim.""

"" ' When a company comes to monopolize a market—when it grows so big that it can threaten other industries just by entering them—it ceases to be merely a company. It becomes an institution so powerful that it can rule over people like a government. That was the insight of Brandeis,' ” [Khan said].

1024,Is the current market volatility due to Triple Witching?,,214,iuj35l,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/iuj35l/is_the_current_market_volatility_due_to_triple/,1600348057.0,"I just learned about the Triple Witching, which is a day four times a year that the simultaneous expiration of stock options, futures, and index options happen on the same day. It occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September and December. Tomorrow Sept. 18th is this quarter's TW.

It's interesting to note that back in March the TW happened on March 20th, and the following Monday on the 23rd was the coronavirus market bottom.

The huge increase in retail option call buying have been driving market prices unusually higher, and the market makers have to go neutral on the contracts they sell, forcing them to buy the underlying companies stock to do so. As market prices move higher or lower, they have to keep adjusting their position to compensate. Tomorrow those options are expiring, thus the MM's have to unload the stocks that they purchased.

5/6:

Today's trades:  The usual, selling outside the money calls and puts.  However, slightly riskier with some expiring in 9 days.  Just the way the timing worked out.  Still looking at PTON and a few others.

https://preview.redd.it/4hw5sul7t6x41.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=db31fe5a336c02c6a3bc1100ede50012d006f38d

Just over $2,200k in profits in closed trades since starting this last week, and several trades still open.

Closed DIS for $217 profitClosed GM for $75 profitClosed WING for $178 profitClosed SHOP for $400 profitClosed ATVI for $100 profitClosed AMZN for $360 profitClose CLX for $200 profit

Still open

TRIP: Currently $15 profitX: Currently $20 profitMCD: Currently $60 profitC: Currently $30 profitLUV: Currently down $159

I'm ""defending"" my LUV trade by ""rolling it out"" to June and also selling a May call.  Specifically, by roll out I mean I buy to close the current LUV put and then sell to open June 19 put at the same strake (at the same time).  I'm also selling a call at the same strike (27.5) with the expiration  (June 19).  This creates a ""short straddle"".  Received  $430 credit.

More earnings trades later today.  And you if you haven't figured it out yet, I'll be selling calls and puts.   If I have a slightly bullish stance (ie. think the stock will go up) I usually sell two puts and one call.  If I have a slightly bearish stance (ie. think stock will go down) I sell two calls and one put.

Earnings trades:

https://preview.redd.it/zcjg1w2w30x41.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41f1b388e98d8b99b8d0190f7df6f1419baf73b

Another busy day, but I'll get to question soon.

Closed half of SHOP (the call credit spread, aka closing both calls) for about $0 (i think actually $5+).Leaving the puts (the sold put and the bought put)  going into earnings. This is now a put credit spread (bullish trade).  Same thing with AMZN.

LUV naked put is now in the money, which is fine (like I said I don't mind buying 100 shares if I get assigned).    If IV (aka volatility) goes up a little I will probably sell a call.

IV has gone down in many underylings (stocks) and the job report comes out friday so I may close a lot of positions before the end of the week.IV dropped a ton in MSFT and TWTR:Closed MSFT (bought to close the call and put) for $150 profit (74% profit)Closed TWTR (bought to close call and put) for $80 (64% profit)

New trades:**\*Beginner trade:**  I think CLX will keep going up and CLX IV rank is 28-ish.  A year ago this would be high IV, but in this market it could be debated if this is high or low.  However, I think IV will go up again in the future in CLX.  Thus, I bought a call.  However, I rarely if ever just buy a call.  I also sell a call.  This creates a call debit spread.  Research indicates this is strategy has a higher probability of profit, and research also indicates the most profitable call debit spread is to buy the (approximately) 60 delta call and sell the 40 delta call approximately 45 days out.  Also, it costs less than buying a call.  Here was the trade:

https://preview.redd.it/azbrtepknzw41.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=f290809934c05c24c11f5d7cf8948e867cfb6e23

If i had just bought the 195 strike, june 19 call it would have cost $960.  This trade cost me $635.

Other trades (I actually made this yesterday and closed it today because IV dropped and I made 50% profit, just didn't have time to post it yesterday):

I'm going to look at earnings trades later today (for companies announcing earnings throughout the week) and will post those.  Looking at the ones with the highest IV like PTON, ATVI, GM, BUD, ETSY, BYND.

Might do a YOLO play as well.  I typically reserve 5% of my account for YOLO trades just for fun.

5/4:Crazy couple days with work, but I'll try and get to everyone's questions later today.

Notes/thoughts from over the weekend: I love Tesla and think long term they are the future.  However, those who saw my comments below or were on discord saw my comments about Tesla (TSLA).  New people love to trade ""sexy"" companies like Tesla.  ...But you never know what Elon is going to say and the swings in price are very unpredictable.  This is why I avoided TSLA and typically avoid companies like TSLA.

5/1:

\*\*Trade:\*\*AMZN	1	15-May	2120	put	(bought put)

    \-1	15-May	2130	put	(sold put)
    
    \-1	15-May	2500	call	(sold call)
    
    1	15-May	2510	call	(bought call)

**Cost**: Received $265

**DTE**: 14 days (which is about as short as I go).  45 daysish out required to much ""buying power"" (ie. them holding to much of money as sort of collateral that I then couldn't trade with).

**Strike prices**:   TLDR: I wanted to sell options in AMZN because vol is high, but AMZN share price makes that to risky of a trade (very high $$ potential loss).  I limited potential loss (and also some of the credit aka $ I received) by also buying options.Longer: Based on delta.   Sold the 20 delta put and sold the 15 delta call.  This is a slightly bullish trade.  Generally speaking a 16 delta call or put is 1 standard deviation out.  I will explain this later.  But I considered doing selling a 16 delta call and a 16 delta put.  However, I think the stock might go up so I slightly shifted the strike prices to a more bullish trade by moving the put up to the 20 delta put (higher strike price) and the sold call to the 15 delta (higher strike price).  However, have a naked call (ie sold call) and a naked put  (ie sold put) in a $2300 stock is to risky for me (and not allowed in my small account for Reddit) because if the trade goes against me (ie. goes really really bad) I could be required to sell 100 shares of AMZN at 2500 if AMZN goes and stays above 2500 or sell 100 shares of amazon at 2130 if goes and stays below 2130 (and I don't have any amazon shares).  So I bought the put at the next lowest strike and bought the call at the next highest strike.  Max loss now is around $700.

Intermediate level explanation:  I thought about doing a strangle but did an iron condor instead to reduce risk.

**Why this strategy:**  I noticed AMZN volatility was still high after earnings (which is not common).  I expect volatility to come down over the weekend.   The ideal scenario for this trade would be that vol drops to 0 and the stock price stays the exact same.

**What helps me in this trade:** Time (ie. every day that passes), decreased volatility or no change in volatility, AMZN stock price staying between 2130 and 2500.

**What hurts me:** Increase in vol, stock price going above 2500 or below 2130.

Probability of profit if hold this to expiration: \~65%

**Trade hack:** If you are selling a call or put you can estimate the chance of profit by subtracting the delta of the call or put from 100.  Example, selling the 20 delta put has an 80% chance of making a profit.

Note: Sometimes delta is in decimal form (ie. 0.2 instead of 20) or negative for puts (ex. -.2).

**Potential trades I'm looking at today:**

\-MCD earnings-MSFT earnings-Create synthetic stock position in an oil company (or company related to oil)-Short XBI (biotech ETF) position-TSLA (maybe)-SPX (maybe)

Current trades (approximately):

LUV +$30SHOP +$140C -$45 - I need C stock to stay between 35 and 55. It gone up since i opened the position and is now at 49.  I'm watching this one (I set alerts so I don't have to literally watch), but if it C stock hits 55 I'll make an adjustment.  Specifically, I'll ""roll up"" the sold put.  Meaning that I sold a put with strike price of 35.  If C hits 55 ill buy to close that put and sell to open a new put with a higher strike price.

General advice after talking to some people who work for me: If you don't have a ROTH IRA and you are eligible to open one, you should do that ASAP.  Even if you only have $100 to put in it.  Happy to explain why if you want.  Eligibility is based on a couple things (students loans, annual income, marital status, etc.) but if you are single will make under $124k in 2020 or married and will make under (combined) $196k you are definitely eligible.

I opened a new account with $5,000 to show how I would (and will) make trades in a smaller account.  I realize some of the trades I posted here are a little complicated, so I'll definitely make some basic trades and post those.  Also, I know the livestream had some technical issues and in retrospect some of the things I talked about were more complicated than I had planned, but I'm happy to do another one and answer questions or actually make trades.

I'll also keep track of profits/losses, mainly because I feel like there are a lot of scammers out there who try and sell all sorts of stuff that falsify trades and profits\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Update for **4/28**

**Updated Discord link** [here](https://discord.gg/PP2Cnk)

Thoughts:  All trades from yesterday appear to be profitable (or will likely be profitable outside of some crazy event).  Meaning that I'm not going to do anything with those trades (ie. I'm not adjusting them).  A mistake I made when I was younger (that typically led to losing money) was constantly tinkering with trades.  But all of my trades have time to their advantage, so now I just wait.

I had a request on discord to do some more simple trades.  I have to do some work to do during the day today (and everyday) but will take a break at **3:00pm to stream live where I will demonstrate some trades and answer questions.  I will post the link here and discord.**  To the people that I asked, I use the TastyWorks platform and will give examples on there.  I have no affiliation with them, but if you are going to download it you can use my referall and I think you get something free (link [here](https://start.tastyworks.com/#/login?referralCode=3WVKA3VKT6)).

**4/27**

3:15 pm.  That might be all my trades for today.  Since I trade mainly based on mechanics and odds of potential profit it doesn't take me much time to find/place the trades.   Plus I have real work I do most of the day, trading is just a nice break.   But I am looking at a few more trades before close.  I'll update if I make them.

**Earnings trades:**

**LUV** naked put:

Sold the May 18th put with strike price 27

**Cost**: $95 credit.

**Strike price and DTE**: I'll explain in the why this strategy part.

Why this strategy: To extremely and way overly simplify...in general there is more money to be made by selling puts vs selling calls for reasons that don't really matter at this point.  But you can basically thing about it like a put costs more than a call.  So when you sell a put, you get more credit ($) than selling a call.

""Hey mbhudson1, you sold a naked put in an airline? Isn't that a bullish trade meaning that you think the price of the stock will go up after earnings?!  You realize nobody is flying right now, right?""

Another good question person that doesn't exist.

In this circumstance I'm using an interesting strategy that not a lot of beginners typically know about.  In the long run I don't think airlines are going out of business, especially LUV.  At some point I plan on buying stock in LUV.  Ideally I would buy at the bottom of the market, just like everyone else wants to do.  However, nobody can predict the bottom.   So what i'm doing is selling a put with the full expectation that this might expire in the money and I get assigned 100 shares of stock.  This is almost always how I buy stock because it's sort of a win-win.

**Scenarios**: LUV stock goes up: I keep the $95 LUV stock stays the same: I keep the $95LUV stock goes down a little: I keep the $95LUV stock goes below 27 (and is below 27 on May 15): I now own 100 shares of LUV....and I keep the $95.

**C (Citigroup) strangle**

Also not a beginner trade, but you could turn this into an iron condor.

**Cost**: Received $170 credit

**DTE**: I could have done this for a shorter DTE since it's an earnings play, but 53 days out is much less risky for naked options.

**Strike prices**:   Picked strike prices that are outside how far the stock price is estimated to move after the earnings announcement.   This can be estimated several ways, but I just went with closest call and put to 15 delta (which is around 1 standard deviation out).  I could have gone even farther out on the strike prices (ie. higher call strike and lower put strike) to be less risky, but there is very limited profit potential in a lower priced stock (lower compared to something like SHOP) when you get out to 5 and 10 delta options.

**Why this strategy**:  Volatility almost always goes down after an earnings announcement.   Instead of trying to bet on which way the stock price will go on the earnings announcement, I'm essentially just betting that it won't go below 35 or above 55.

Other strategies here:  I considered a ratio spread (which I can explain to beginners later) and also just considered selling a put.

\_\_\_

This is not a beginner trade FYI.  I'll let you know when I do what I consider beginner trades.

**Iron condor in SHOP**

https://preview.redd.it/xyai5w26fev41.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c5ac485abeb2570ac7a293a79e583389c87dc5

FYI: In case you don't know -1 means it's a sold options contract +1 means i bought a contract.

**Cost**:  I received $605 credit for this trade.  This does require a lot of buying power (ie. collateral).

**Days to expiration** (DTE): I do most options trades around 40-55 DTE.  I'll explain why later.

**Strike prices**:  I like to sell calls and puts out of the money.  Specially I like to use what is referred to as delta to determine which strike prices to sell.  Typically I sell 10 delta calls and 5 delta puts.  It might sound complicated but the delta is given in many trading platforms (here is an example on Tasty Works: [https://ibb.co/ThkKqnM](https://ibb.co/ThkKqnM)).

""Hey mbhudson1, you said you like to sell calls and puts and that -1 means it's a sold options contract.  Why are there also bought options in your trade?"".   Good question person that doesn't exist.  Selling a call and put in SHOP  (which is called a strangle) is to risky for me.  Selling an option alone is called a naked option.  Naked options have a lot more risk (technically unlimited potential risk).   By buying a call at a strike price higher than the sold call and by buying a put at a strike lower than the sold put I have made this a ""defined risk"" trade.   I do sell naked options many times, but typically not if the underlying (ie stock) price is in the triple digits.  A lot of big time options traders lost a lot of money on naked calls in TSLA back in Feb.

**Why this strategy**:  I'm betting on volatility dropping here.  SHOP currently has relatively high volatility.    I can tell that by looking at the implied volatility rank which on an overly simplified level is where the volatility ranks today vs days in the past.  Right now it's at 67%.

Also, time is to my advantage here.  If nothing else changes (volatility, price of SHOP stock, etc.) every day that goes by I make money.

Plan moving forward on this trade:  If I make 50% profit I will close this trade.  To close this trade I would buy the 930 call and buy the 385 put while selling the 960 call and selling the 300 put.  If the trade ""goes against me"", I will defend it but will wait until that happens to explain it.

Summary of this trade:  I try and use as many things as possible to my advantage.  In this trade time is to my advantage, decrease (or no change) in volatility is to my advantage, and changes in SHOP price don't really effect anything (unless they are massive like to 930 or 385).  When you hear people at r/wallstreetbets complaining about how everyday their calls or puts are decreasing in value...i'm one of the people on the other end of those trades.

1029,Dividend Plays explained,,209,kf4ert,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kf4ert/dividend_plays_explained/,1608233628.0,"With the upcoming SPY dividend, I thought some people may be interested in how a dividend play works. Generally it involves buying and selling calls and hoping your shorts aren't assigned. It is also difficult for a retail trader to do without at least Portfolio Margin.

Here's one way to make the play. You would buy/sell a vertical and then exercise you longs. So for example you you buy the DEC SPY 295 calls and sell the 300 calls for 5, 1,000 times. You would then exercise your 295 calls. If all your short 300 calls are assigned, you would have no position and your loss would be your commissions. So if you were paying .25 a contract, It would cost you $500 in commissions. But, for every one of your 300 calls that's not assigned, you make the 1.41 dividend. So if only 4 of the 1,000 calls aren't assigned, it becomes profitable.

When you are not assigned, your position becomes short calls and long stock. So in the above example if you were not assigned on 10 contracts, you would be long 1,000 shares of SPY and short 10 of the 300 calls.

What's the risk here? Well in the above example if you are not assigned on 10 of the calls, you will be synthetically short 10 of the 300 puts (below 300 your short calls stop giving you protection for your long stock). You can buy them in for .01, but if for some reason the market drops big overnight before you know how many to buy there is a risk there. Another risk is you screw up the exercise and it doesn't go through for some reason (systems down, mistake, etc.)

You will find the these plays are done in the contracts that have the most open interest. Its also best if the market has run up a lot (bigger chance of customer open interest, as customers may not realize they should exercise) If you look at today volume on the Dec calls you will see big volume in the deeper calls with big open interest.

Note also if you did this play you will have some cost of carry on the stock until expiration.

You are dealing with some big numbers here, the 1,000 lot spread would represent over $37 million in stock. So even though there isn't a lot of risk with the play, its not really a retail play.",options
1030,Disconnect Emotion from trading - A lesson,,209,hf317j,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hf317j/disconnect_emotion_from_trading_a_lesson/,1593012598.0,"This morning I learnt a very valuable lesson.. Two actually. The first was to not be a dumbass and only make trades that make sense for your account size regardless of the potential reward and secondly, in my opinion even more importantly, never let emotions influence your trades. 

Yesterday after the crazy rally that AAPL had, i knew there would be a pullback to stabilize the price a bit. My strategy was to enter the play at what I thought would be the peak of AAPL rally, around 370. At 371, with my opinion, great timing, i purchased the 365 put with a 6/26 expiration. Terrible expiration imo but it was the only contract close enough to the money at a reasonable price for my account. (The trade was around 70% of my buying power, my first lesson). I planned to sell bby end of day when the pullback occurs. I was busy at the time I wanted to sell and for family reasons had to hold through the night. Come this morning, AAPL opens lower and aim thinking, great it will continue a decline and correct its price. Welp around 10 min into market open I see it begin to rally again to 368 and get freaked out, knowing that this is practically my whole account and even a couple points higher could basically wipe me out. So i sold the contract due to the emotions. 

In the moment, it seemed like a good idea since I did not want to take on the risk of blowing up my account. Now AAPl is at 362 and my contract is worth double the price. 

Hopefully you guys can also learn from my mistake and not let emotions influence your trades.",options

After a 67 percent drawdown and a margin call in March, I end up with a 37 percent loss for 2020. No need to say I told you so, for those so tempted.

A near perfect storm of an accelerating decline with some sharp rallies, my big ego from a 55 percent gain in 2019, and being sick with the flu, led to some bad decisions. 

I had at least 50 percent buying power available when the downside started. That gets chewed up real quick on portfolio margin.  I was faked out by many of the rally attempts. Obviously, I was over exposed to a sharp decline.

When the margin call came, I moved most of what I had left to cash and regrouped. Overall I see myself as a cautious trader. I'm sure more than a few were wiped out and most of them tell no tales.

The good is that I got off the mat, up over 40 percent from the account lows. The bad is that a 200 percent gain is needed after losing two thirds of the account. 

The good is that I have other accounts, that are way more conservative. 

I've gotten better about looking at the task at hand. The day, the hour, the moment directly ahead. My predictions are no better than coin flips, so I'll skip those.

My rule number one is

Live to trade another day

This past year, I survived and hopefully am wiser for the experience. Happy new year to all.

/Edit//
Several people asked about positions. Mostly short strangles on the big cap stocks and indexes. Rebalancing to near delta neutral was a train wreck because of the gap openings and volatility exploded. Again, I was very sick during this time so clear thinking was unavailable.

Biggest thing I might have done different is move mostly to cash after say 40 or 50 percent down. Would have avoided the margin call and it is a lot easier to come back from 

Even 50 percent down is horrible but a 100 percent gain gets back to even. That compares to the 200 percent needed to overcome a 67 percent drawdown.

I've been trading longer than I care to admit. Let's just say more than 10 years.",options
1033,Intro to Iron Butterflies,,207,ipv8b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipv8b3/intro_to_iron_butterflies/,1599707046.0,"Im back with another write-up, this time on Iron Butterflies. Next up is Iron Condors! [Article Link](https://medium.com/@ProjectTheta/what-are-iron-butterfly-options-aacebc8a6565)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this article I will tell you all about Iron Butterflies, also known as the “Iron Fly.” I will also tell you ways to decrease risk, and tell you details about how you can make profitable trades with the Iron Fly.

## What is an Iron Fly?

The iron fly is a popular options order which is very similar to an ITM (In-The-Money) Iron Condor. *An article on iron condors is coming soon, stay tuned.*

When someone opens an Iron Fly, they are betting that a stock will decrease in volatility, and expire at a target price.

The Iron Fly is constructed by the following:

* Buying and Selling a Call
* Buying and Selling a Put

As of now, you may be thinking that this sounds like two credit spreads, and you are correct. However, the differences become more pronounced with a good old example.

Here is what the profit graph for an Iron Butterfly looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/9dsbydbpk8m51.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=5abe184ac1e8f6679c624c9d8c220b62e57e1dc4

From this graph, we can understand that:

* Our gains and losses are capped.
* Our max gain is only at one price (our target price).
* We have 2 break evens on our trade.

## Example Iron Fly

>We think that SPY will remain at $340 until 9/18, and decrease in volatility. We know that it won’t trade outside $335 and $345.

This is a perfect scenario for an Iron Fly. Lets get to what we do:

* **Sell the $340 9/18 Call @ 3.00** (We sell a call at our target price)
* **Sell the $340 9/18 Put @ 3.20** (We sell a put at our target price)
* **Buy the $345 9/18 Call @ -1.00** (We buy a call at our outside strike)
* **Buy the $335 9/18 Put @ -1.50** (We buy a put at our outside strike)

**Net Credit Recieved: $370**

**Explanation:**

If SPY expires near our target price of $340, the options that we sold will have very low intrinsic value. This paired with theta decay is where we profit from.

Next, we bought a call & put at our outside strikes to cap our losses and lower our collateral requirement. **Our collateral can be calculated by:**

*Difference Between Strikes x 100 = Collateral Required*

**And our max loss can be calculated by:**

*Collateral Required — Premium Received = Max Loss*

>*In our example, we require $500 in collateral, and our max loss is $170*

## Potential Outcomes

There are many potential outcomes for our example. Here is the breakdown:

* **SPY expires at $340.00:** This is an extremely rare case, if SPY expires exactly at our target price, then we take home our full profit, $370.
* **SPY expires between $336.30-$343.70:** This is the range that we profit in, because of the $370 that we received. The further out from our target price, the less profit we get.
* **SPY expires between $335-$336.30 or $343.70-$345:** This is where I start to lose money, because the premium that I received is not covering the value of the options that I sold.
* **SPY expires >$345 or <$335:** This is where we reach our maximum loss of $170, because our collateral is lost, and all we keep is the premium that we sold earlier.

## Picking a Stock

When picking a stock to open an Iron Fly on, take the following into account:

* What is the investor sentiment on the stock?
* Are their upcoming earnings? Big dividends?
* Do people think that the stock is overvalued? (optional)
* Does the Stock have a historical uptrend? (optional)

Remember that picking a stock is the most important choice. Regardless of how you form your Iron Fly, if the stock is a bad decision, you will lose.

## Picking Strike Prices

Before you pick random strikes for your trade, think about the support/resistance levels, along with the entire market sentiment. If you have limited capital to put up, you will have to tighten your strikes.

## Choose High Liquidity

If you are not experienced with Iron Fly’s, then I recommend trying them out on SPY.

Choose a stock/ETF that has high-liquidity, tight bid-ask spreads, and high volume. These will ensure that you can exit a bad trade, or lock in profits quickly.

## Closing your Trade

Many times, you will already reach your take-profit percentage, like 30% or 50%, and want to close a trade. Other times, you want to close out before losing it all.

Regardless, closing an Iron Fly can be beneficial. I recommend closing it a week before expiration, because brokerages can mishandle the selling of the stock, which results in large losses larger than your account size.

## Conclusion

The Iron Fly can be very profitable in scenario’s where you believe that a stock will stay at a certain price, with relatively low volatility.

The Iron Fly is a great strategy to have in your tool-box, because you can trade on price action in a completely new way.

EDIT: I was asked to put this into the article, as an explainer for some confusion:

1. Break even, max profit, and max loss values ONLY APPLY AT EXPIRATION. You can only gain the full premium, or reach your max loss potential if you hold your contracts till expiration. Many people prefer to close out of contracts in a specified amount of time, like 1 month, or 30dte.
2. Max profit comes with max risk and max holding time, so please, CLOSE YOUR POSITIONS BEFORE EXPIRATION.

I have about 20k in options that don’t expire until January 2022 mostly in airlines (AAL, DAL, UAL, JBLU, ALK), cruises (RCL, CCL, NCLH), and entertainment (PLAY, BUD, CNK, MGM)

I have a few other plays going but that is the bulk of my portfolio. I started by buying stocks in these companies and then realized I could make bigger gains with options.

Why does it seem like everyone else is so focused on shorting stocks and buying options that expire within a month or 2 at most?

1036,Thinkorswim Implied Volatility indicator - IV FORECAST CLOUD,,207,aispuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/aispuh/thinkorswim_implied_volatility_indicator_iv/,1548197605.0,"Hey guys,

So there's a lot of ""fancy"" tools, studies, and strategies that you can throw on your thinkorswim charts out of the box. The appeal of ToS for a lot of technical-based traders is that you can turn your charts into lines of rainbow barf in a snap of your fingers.

However, when you dig a little deeper, trying to do backtesting to see whether or not any of that out-of-the-box stuff is actually useful is a little harder than it looks. Especially when you try to do ANYTHING related to historical option prices or implied volatility.

So here's a pretty handy indicator I developed to help me get a visual understanding of where implied volatility has been, what price ranges the market was implying, and where the stock ended up. Presenting...

&#x200B;

[**THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY FORECAST CLOUD**](https://i.imgur.com/djZnP9E.png)

&#x200B;

**Basically what this bad boy does** is look at what a stock's implied volatility was 30 days (21 daily bars) ago, plug that into a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion model, and spit out the 1 standard deviation price ranges for the current bar.

By plotting these ranges, you can quickly and easily see where and when a stock's implied volatility overstated or understated the actual realized volatility in the 30 days following.

If you want to be a little more specific, this basically means that for any bar INSIDE of the cloud, selling a straddle or a strangle 30 days prior most likely would have been profitable, because IV OVERSTATED the actual realized volatility. For any bar OUTSIDE of the cloud, buying a straddle or a strangle 30 days prior most likely would have been a profitable trade, because IV UNDERSTATED the actual realized volatility.

&#x200B;

**Another way to look at it is this:** The cloud levels tell you the expected range from thinkorswim's built-in ""ProbabilityOfExpiringCone"" study 1 month prior to whatever day you're looking at. But because you can't plot the probability cone study in the past, just the future, it's really hard to tell whether or not those ranges were actually correct. This is a way that you can ""backtest"" those probability ranges.

So basically I accidentally reverse engineered a proprietary study. Whoops. You can tell from the picture that the cloud is MAYBE a few cents off from the actual ToS study. Although I personally think mine's more accurate because I use the actual yields instead of stale fed funds overnight rates, but that's a different story.

&#x200B;

**CAVEATS/NOTES:**

* Obviously this indicator isn't perfect. There are actually quite a few things I found annoying when trying to code it, so there's going to be some degree of error.
* I'm *pretty* sure that the IV number that you can call from a chart study is a VIX-style weighted average 30-day ATM IV, so it's not going to capture the nuances or specifics of vol skew/term structure, although there's probably some broad detail that remains from using a weighted average. Again, this is just a guess, I couldn't back into the IV number they have on the charts, so I'll have to talk to one of the ToS Devs to see if I can get more info.
* Apparently calling historical dividends is too much for thinkscript to handle, so I had to use what I had available to me to handle dividend yields. Also, ETF dividends apparently just aren't available at all from thinkscript, so I had to use the current yield (as in the dividend yield of the last bar on the chart), which obviously won't be right in every situation, but it's better than nothing.
* I can say that it seems to be pretty spot-on for most tickers I've looked at. Plus it passes the sniff test - periods of low IV tend to precede bars outside the cloud, and periods of high IV tend to precede bars inside the cloud. If any other thinkscripters/quants have suggestions or bugs, feel free to let me know and I'll try to fix it.

&#x200B;

# EDIT:

From feedback I've gotten, there are a few instances of the cloud not working with certain tickers or in certain situations. Most likely these issues are being caused by bad dividend data, yield data, or implied volatility data on TDA's end. If the cloud has gaps or doesn't show up at all (assuming you're still using it on a daily chart like you're supposed to), most likely this is the issue. I've updated the code to try and back fill data to fix this to the extent I can, but this probably won't solve every issue on every ticker. Also, **THIS CODE IS NOT VALID FOR FUTURES. IT WILL NOT WORK ON THE PLATFORM FOR FUTURES SYMBOLS, AND THE MATH IS NOT CORRECT IF USED WITH FUTURES.**

&#x200B;

**RAW CODE:**

\## IMPLIED VOLATILITY FORECAST CLOUD

\## By /u/notextremelyhelpful

\## Version: v1.1

\## Last update: 2/1/2019

\##

\## This study plots the upper and lower expected stock price ranges

\## forecasted by the Implied Volatility values from 30 days prior (21 day bars).

\##

\## If a given bar is above or below the cloud for that period, it means that

\## the implied volatility from 30 days prior underestimated the future realized volatility

\## at that point in time. This implies that (in general) equity options were underpriced,

\## and that buying an ATM straddle or strangle may have been profitable.

\##

\## Conversely, if the price range is inside the cloud, it means that implied volatility

\## from 30 days prior overestimated the realized volatility. This implies that (in general)

\## equity options were overpriced, and that selling a straddle or strangle may have

\## been profitable.

\##

\## NOTES/DISCLOSURES:

\## 1. This study is intended to be used on DAILY charts, and only forecasts forecasts

\##    stock prices for 21 day bars in advance. The use of 21 trading days for a

\##    30 calendar day period is widely used, although minor deviations for particular

\##    data points may exist.

\##

\## 2. These values are purely theoretical (based on Geometric Brownian Motion),

\##    and should not be considered a reliable method of determining the past or future

\##    profitability of any specific options strategy.

\##

\## 3. These forecasted values (and prior forecasts of current period values)

\##    heavily rely on several key assumptions which may materially impact

\##    the accuracy of forecasted prices. Several key assumptions include:

\##        - The appropriateness of Geometric Brownian Motion as a model for stock prices

\##        - The accuracy of Thinkorswim's ""ImpVolatility"" study

\##        - The accuracy of Thinkorswim's price and dividend data

\##

\## 4. Input values have been calculated on a best-efforts basis, using data and methods

\##    readily available and known at the time. Further refinement or improvement

\##    in data quality or methodology of this Thinkorswim study may be appropriate.

\##

\## Enjoy!

I am going to cash out half tomorrow if the stock trades flat overnight and hold the rest through earnings.

Basically, I am posting this as I want to discuss risk vs. reward. Is anyone else doing this play? I do not see NIO reaching 70 in 3 trading days, however, it seems like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. I did nearly the same play with $TSLA during battery week, resulting in gains.

EDIT: Based on the general consensus of the comments, I have closed my positions for a gain of 27 dollars. I underestimated the ability for NIO to rise and will switch to either CSPs or covered calls. Thanks for the thoughts.

Today was an amazing day!  I don’t believe that the bottom has been made, and I don’t think that today was a day to be a buyer, but as my Closing Comments says, “I could not have been more wrong.”  We cut through every area of supply that I pointed out in last night’s Weekly Strategies.  Here is the closing comment for tonight: https://youtu.be/JHjU3KOAQR8 .  My problem with today’s action is that while everyone wants to believe that this was the bottom, historically, it is without precedent.  There are many problems that we will face that are not currently known. The earnings of the companies that have no idea how long consumers are not buying clothes at Macy’s or TJ Maxx, or restaurants, where it’s not like you can make up the business with people eating 2 meals at a time.  The closure of the Airbus plant in Alabama, or American Airlines cutting their N.Y. flights from 271 /day down to 13 is just not something that can be quantified when it comes to the net effect to both the balance sheet and profits.  But the DJIA was +1627.46 (7.73%), NASDAQ +540.16 (7.33%), S&P 500 +175.03 (7.03%), the Russell +86.72 (8.24%) and the DJ Transports +532.38 (7.29%).  Market internals left a lot to be desired with the A/D solid at NYSE 9.5:1 and NASDAQ 5.5:1, but volume was anemic with NYSE 1.4 billion and the NASDAQ 3.8 billion. All 30 DJIA stocks were higher with BA leading the way +113.31 DP’s but no other triple digit winners.  On the +11.37% gainer on 3/24 there were 10 triple-digit winners.

The explosion of companies like NIO and PLTR has not been missed on Reddit. In fact, [these two tickers are the most popular this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/), with NIO being mentioned 15,867 times and PLTR 10,570 times in the past six days (not including today).

In addition to mentioning these tickers over 10,000 times each, Redditors have bet big on the future share prices of NIO, PLTR, and other companies. In fact, Redditors have mentioned a total of over 2,000 option contracts in the past week. So, how well have these contracts performed? We can look at the 25 most popular contracts to find out:

Out of the expired contracts, 30% were ITM and 70% were OTM. Notably, the AAL $12.5 PUT 11/20 expired just $0.03 OTM. The majority of non-expired contracts are OTM, with just 20% being ITM. The CRSR $40 CALL 12/18 is just $0.33 ITM right now. Currently, just 24% of contracts are ITM with 76% OTM as of market close yesterday. 

Redditors seem especially bullish on PLTR and NIO with both tickers having significantly high call volume than put volume. Redditors appear bearish on recovery stocks, including Carnival Corporation and American Airlines Group.

I know I will be watching closely to see whether the 15 non-expired contracts become ITM.

Instead, RH took action on my behalf automatically, buying the 19 contracts back at a cost of $77 each; this cost me $1,463.00. Now, instead of owning AMD @ $47 and having earned $684 for selling the Puts, I've net a loss of -$779.00.

Why did Robinhood automatically close this position for me? Regardless of where AMD is today, that automatic action cost me $1,463.00 that I did not approve of.

I've emailed RH to understand why, but the responses so far have not been helpful at all. **This is not a spread, it was not purchased on margin, it was cash-secured.**

**Response #1 (From Robinhood):**

Good morning,

Thanks for reaching out and I hope you are doing well.

We’ll review your spread 60-90 minutes before closing on your spread’s expiration date. At that point, a few different things can happen:

* If both legs are in the money, we’ll assign and exercise them.
* If both legs are out of the money and are not at risk of being in the money, we’ll let your positions expire.
* If one leg is at risk or in the money, we'll close the spread, or match the option with another form of collateral (like cash or stocks) and let you exercise it.

*Keep in mind that the Risk Check occurs about an hour before market close on the date of expiration. Risk Checks cannot be opted out of.*

You can check out our [Help Center article on expiration procedure](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005656423-Expiration-Exercise-and-Assignment) for more information if you’re curious. Otherwise, just let me know if you have any other questions. I’m here to help!

Sincerely,

**My reply:**

Hi \[Redacted\],

Thanks for responding. However, the trade in question was not a spread, but rather 19 AMD $47 Puts, which should've obligated me to purchase 1900 shares of  AMD @ $47/share.

Instead, Robinhood automatically purchased back the Puts I sold, at a cost of $.77/share, or $1,463.00.

Why did Robinhood automatically buy back my shares an hour before market close? Was it an error in Robinhood's logic, attributed to the fact that I also had a credit spread on AMD open at that time?

\---

**Response #2 (from Robinhood):**

My apologies for the confusion and inconvenience. I can provide clarity.

I can understand your situation but for the time being our system will pair the contracts as a spread.

If one leg is at risk in the money, then we will close the spread.

We are aware that we can improve the option sell out process and I will use this situation as feedback.

Robinhood calculates upper and lower bounds for options positions.

***If your option’s strike price falls within the upper and lower bounds, your position is considered “at risk” of being in the money or is in the money, and we’ll place an order to close your position.***

\*\*How we calculate the upper bound:\*\*Last trade price + (1.5% \* Maintenance requirement \* Last trade price when the risk check is run)

\*\*How we calculate the lower bound:\*\*Last trade price - (1.5% \* Maintenance requirement \* Last trade price when the risk check is run)

**Example:**\* You own an XYZ 1/1/2020 $10 Call\* XYZ's last trade price when the risk check is run is $9.97, and the maintenance requirement is 25%.

The upper bound would be $10.01 ($9.97+\[1.5%x25%x$9.97\]) and the lower bound would be $9.93($9.97-\[1.5%x25%x$9.97). Since the call falls within these bounds, we'll close the position.

I hope this clears things up! Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

Sincerely,

\[Redacted\]

# EDIT #1:

Absolutely none of this trade was performed on margin; it was cash-secured. I have (and had) the money freely available in my account to purchase 1900 shares of AMD @ $47/share should I be assigned—which is why I am so completely confused by what Robinhood did, and what action I should take next.

I believe RH's risk mitigation system confused my open options transactions and somehow merged/mixed up two open transactions to and tried to close both (see the last photo.)

1048,"The reason SPACs are great for wheeling, their option skew and risk/reward",,201,kagq1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kagq1n/the_reason_spacs_are_great_for_wheeling_their/,1607612365.0,"Hey people,

I've been wheeling SPACs for a while, I think it's worth looking into and understanding how the risk/reward works.

[FDscanner](https://app.fdscanner.com/), the option screener I made has also been fully revamped and supports SPACs.

**Why consider SPACs?**

The premise of why we're giving special consideration to SPACs is risk management. The assets of a SPAC is 100% cold hard cash, they IPO to raise money from investors, which is then used to acquire private companies, bringing them public.

In other words, if they IPO at $10/share. They keep $10/share in the bank. At IPO prices, their price book ratio is 1.0, and all of that book value is cold hard cash in the bank. No goodwill, assets, inventory or accounts receivables. 

All cash, which is returned to shareholders in full if they cannot find a target to acquire, or if enough shareholders ask for their money back. Interest from the cash usually can run the operations.

**SPACs = Zero Coupon Bond (above 100% NAV)**

From the most pessimistic point of view I see them like a zero coupon bond. Now SPACs pre-merger often trades at a few percent premium because they do have upsides. You could view them as a zero coupon bond at 105% NAV. On rare occasions, like [PSTH](https://app.fdscanner.com/ticker/PSTH), they trade up to 30% above NAV. 

**Why it's good for theta gang (short puts/covered calls)**

Now we've established that SPACs have a strong floor at NAV value. In that case, shouldn't they have really low IV?

Strangely not, they tend to have IV of a tech company at minimum, and on occasions go above 100% IV. We got 2 great ingredients for a wheel target, high IV, solid book value as a fallback.


**This leads into the thetagang strategy. **

**1) Short Puts on SPACs close to NAV**

Sell an ATM put on a SPAC at 110% NAV 6 weeks out, and collect 1.3% a week.


**2) Covered Calls on SPACs close to NAV**

On a 110% NAV SPAC, do a buy and write covered calls at 120% NAV. Often times, the call one strike higher is only barely less money than an ATM put due to high call skew. You receive slightly less premium but can capture potential upside.

**Why SPACs have high call skew**

If you look at the 16 SPACs we have on [FDscanner](https://app.fdscanner.com/), 10 of 16 of them have sufficient option liquidity to have an option skew. All 10 of them have call skew. [PSTH](https://app.fdscanner.com/ticker/PSTH) tops the call skew charts at 2.27 and many of them hits the first page of our call skew index. The step by step skew computation is available if you search for the ticker on the site.

The reason is their limited downside at NAV, with uncapped upside, combined with SPACs being really hot in the market, causing speculation on what their potential target acquisition is (eg Stripe for PSTH), and that speculative fever goes in their options/shares.

Also some SPACs have free warrants if you hold through merger. Warrants are OTM calls (in respect to NAV) with a few years before expiry. This further increases the upside ratio to downside.


As for thetagang, we can simply take advantage by doing covered calls. You will get slightly less money or a higher breakeven point but get to capture the upside between current price and your covered call strike.


I've been doing this for a while because I like the sound of 1% a week on a 110% NAV zero coupon bond. But do your DD, don't overleverage and good luck. 

Also a note of caution, SPACs can occasionally trade below their NAV in an extreme bear market, you only have to look back to March 2020 for that.

Reading/watching videos was great, but there is nothing like the real thing, so I started doing real trades as soon as I got the basics down.

I started with selling PUTs, then started doing wheel type strategy where I sold both, CALLs and PUTs, all covered. And only recently started to play around with buying options and hoping to get into that area a bit more.

Here are my stats, since Sep 2nd to today:

Sell stats - options initiated by selling either call or put. Buy stats - options initiated by buying either call or put.

Some things that stood out to me:

\- The buy stats are doing very poorly but there are couple reasons for this: I used buying options to hedge COVID drops and bought worst case scenarios on my assigned stock. Luckily most of the scenarios did not materialize, but also that meant that I lost those option plays. Also I was terrible at managing risk with buys, not getting out of positions once they went negative and just stayed through. I stopped doing that.

\- I read somewhere about the premium capture rate %, and someone was saying how 25% percent was pretty good and I thought I was doing much better than that, for sure. But the real numbers showed that I was at %24 overall (with 31% capture rate at the sell side), so just inline with what some expect it to be when you sell options.

\- Profit realized per day was a bit lower than I expected, but again, it makes sense because in my mind I was thinking I captured a much higher percentage of the premium.

\- Average contract days comes out to just about two weeks! Again, I don't have specific strategy per se around expiration, and use volatility/premium more of a guide which options to sell.

Anyway, figured I would share as it was interesting to see the stats. The most I risked at any one time was some where around $25k. I made $5.6k so far. Nothing earth shattering but decent! And learned a ton while doing this experiment...

This now gives me some good ideas around what I could try tweaking and see if the stats get better.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for me to improve the performance! And good luck to everyone with all your trades.",options

**Idea -** Sell 17 Apr 65 put for 1.14 

**Analysis -** 

Volatility remains high, greatly increasing what one can normally receive for selling OTM puts.  With the recent downturn to about 218 in SPY, JPM bottomed just below 77.  The strike chosen is over 20% below this recent low and about 29% below the current price.  ToS states an 86% chance it expires worthless. Of the big banks, JPM held up (relatively) well during the last financial crisis and the current COVID-19 issue is health related - not due to issues within the financial industry.  This too shall pass...  

The return is about 1.8% for less than a 3 week hold.  As I'm bullish JPM, I'm fine taking delivery of the shares.  

Risks - I do expect the market to continue with Friday's decline and given projections of Peak deaths in the US are right around the expiration of this option, widespread market panic could lower JPM below the strike.

I am starting to do some 'shopping' on quality names that I'm OK owning at lower prices.  The above would be done cash secured, although certainly people could spread it to reduce risk, although less premium will be received.

&#x200B;

 

This article serves to inform on how to to use Iron Condors effectively, and some advise and details to look out for when trading them.

Reading the entire article is crucial, as Iron Condors are pretty complex, and skipping a part may entail confusion. I would also recommend reading [this article on Put Credit Spread’s](https://medium.com/mastering-options/put-credit-spreads-explained-for-beginners-abf93e48be48) before reading, as it will save you a lot of confusion.

Iron Condors are one of the most popular option’s strategies, as they can use theta to generate profit’s from small/flat stock movements. Knowing how to play Iron Condors is a great addition to an options-traders toolkit.

If you know the basics about options, feel free to skip to the “Opening an Iron Condor” Section.

# Account Size

Iron Condors, like all options, use contracts which control 100 shares each. For this reason, it is important to not use your entire account for Iron Condors, as a sudden spike in the market or your stocks could warrant extreme losses. I always recommend:

* \>60% of account size in investments like index funds, and the rest should be diversified into options strategies in diversified stocks.

The technical minimum account size that you would need to run iron condors is $50, but I would recommend having at least $500 in your account to test Iron Condors.

A big reason why Iron Condors are so popular is because they have low collateral requirement, and extremely high max-profit’s compared to other strategies.

# Pick a Stock

Picking a stock to buy/sell an Iron Condor makes the biggest difference in the outcome of your trade. Make sure that you:

>*Pick a stock that you think will trade flat, or have little movement until a certain date.*  
*Pick a stock that is known to not be too volatile, as that will not mix well with Iron Condors.*

## Some of my favorite stocks/etfs to run Iron Condor’s are:

* SPY (S&P 500 Index ETF)
* INTC (Intel)
* F (Ford)

All of these securities have relatively low volatility, and are not exploding in growth currently. This makes it fair game for Iron Condors! Here are some examples of **bad stocks** to sell Iron Condors on:

* TQQQ, TSLA, NKLA, KODK, or Penny Stocks.

# Choosing to Buy or Sell

All options strategies rely on two people; the buyer and the seller. In this article, I will be explaining how to sell Iron Condors, because that is what I am experienced in.

However, you must know that everytime you write (sell) an Iron Condor, someone else is buying it.

When someone else buy’s your Iron Condor, they are thinking the opposite of you. They think that the stock you are trading is going to have a breakout, and high volatility.

If you want to understand how buying Iron Condors work, you can follow along this article, but think in reverse. If the seller (us) loses money, then you (the buyer) will make money.

# Opening the Iron Condor

As I do with all my options strategy write-ups, I will explain the basics, and then go on with an example Iron Condor play.

&#x200B;

[Iron Condor Profit Graph](https://i.redd.it/avcthprl2sm51.gif)

 

From the above profit graph, we can notice that:

* Iron Condors have both max loss, and max profit’s.
* Iron Condors have 2 break evens, and 2 sides to their max loss.

## The Basics

Iron Condors are (in essence) a Put Credit Spread combined with a Call Credit Spread. Put Credit Spread’s bet on a stock not increasing, and a Put Credit Spread bet’s on a stock not decreasing. This is why we want our stock to stay flat to make profit’s.

OTM = Out of the money  
**To open an Iron Condor, you will need to:**

* Sell an OTM Put, then buy an OTM Put (below the Short Put)
* Sell an OTM Call, then buy an OTM Call (above the Short Call)

We will talk about break evens, profit & loss, and collateral in the example below.

Congratulations, you have just constructed an Iron Condor! If you are still confused, then follow along the example below, as it will go more in depth.

# Example Iron Condor

>SPY is currently trading at $335. We think that it will trade flat till Sept. 18, with low volatility.

**Let’s say that we firmly believe that it will not exceed the $330-$338 range, and we only have $100 to spend on this Iron Condor.**

This is the perfect scenario to open an Iron Condor, and profit from the Theta (Time) decay that comes from selling options. We can do the following to open our Iron Condor:

* Sell the SPY $330 Put @ 3.58 Credit (Strike at our lower range)
* Buy the SPY $329 Put @ 3.22 Debit (Right under our lower range)
* Sell the SPY $338 Call @ 2.50 Credit (Strike at our higher range)
* Buy the SPY $339 Call @ 2.11 Debit (Right above our higher range)

**Net Credit:** $75 *(Total Credit — Total Debit)*  
**Collateral Required:** $100 *(Greater Difference between call strikes or put strikes x 100)*

## Explanation

Our example shows how an Iron Condor would look like.

Since the options that we sold outweigh the options that we bought, we end up with a net credit of $75.

Our Put Strikes and Call Strikes are $1 apart. If we multiply that by 100, our collateral requirement is $100.

Our Put’s resemble a Put Credit Spread, which bet’s on SPY trading above $330. Our Call’s resemble a Call Credit Spread, which bet’s on SPY trading below $338.

To find the 2 break-even’s on our Iron Condor, we can subtract/add the net credit received to our spreads.

For the Put’s, 330–0.75 = 329.25. For the call’s, 338+0.75 = 338.75. As you can see, our break-even’s are $329.25 and $338.75.

Our max loss can be calculated by our *collateral requirement — net credit.* Ours would be $100 — $75 = $25 max loss.

Through all these calculations, we can see that if our bet is correct, we can earn a 75% return on our collateral in 1 week. If we are incorrect, we will lose 25% of our collateral.

Now that we have talked about our example, let’s see how we can improve our Iron Condor strategies.

## Managing Risk

There are many ways to lower risk on your Iron Condor’s. Here are a few of the best ways to lower your risk:

* Pick a more stable stock, and don’t trade earning’s or approvals.
* Move your strike prices further out of the money. (this will lower your net credit)
* Tighten the difference between your call strikes and put strikes.

If you want to create a more consistent strategy for playing Iron Condors, then it is important to find the perfect ratio of profit/risk.  
Many people who play Iron Condors will only open a trade if the max profit is >20% of the collateral.

## Understanding Expiration

Although the max loss or max profit may look appealing, it will almost always be better to close a trade before expiration.

Many options traders prefer to close out of a trade once they have reached 50% max profit.

If you do not have enough money to buy 100 shares of the stock, then close out early, because there have been many occurences where only one leg of your trade get’s assigned, and a brokerage will sell it at a large loss.

## Picking Strike Prices

Second to picking a stock, picking your strikes is extremely important. A bad strike could easily reach max loss.

My favorite ways for finding the best strike prices to play is by doing technical analysis, checking for support and resistance, checking investor sentiment, and watching for any upcoming catalysts in the market.

## Understanding Theta

“Theta” is an options greek term which represents time decay. By default, theta will accelerate exponentially the closer a contract comes to expiration.

The Iron Condor’s profit’s are entirely due to Theta, because the intrinsic (actual) value of OTM contracts are $0.

For this reason, it is not advisable to open Iron Condor’s with far away expirations, as the risk of an unexpected breakout trump’s the low theta decay.

Iron Condor’s are best played on weekly or monthly expiration’s, as that is when Theta becomes a driving force in the price.

# Conclusion

Iron Condor’s are an advanced option’s strategy which incorporate both sides of credit spread’s, and profit from low movement and low volatility.

In this article, you learned how to play Iron Condors, and how to lower risk and manage your active positions.

Thank you for reading, and I hope that you found value in this article.

I've been told that the way i'm calculating my downside protection isn't correct but since I'm planning to go to the expiration date and let the options expire or be executed so my cost basis is really all I'm worried about.

I executed two trades so far with this strategy;

    DAL
    - Shares: $2,549.99 (100 shares)
    - Options:
    -- $23 CALL 7/2 Exp: $390
    -- Out of pocket: $2,159.99 ($21.60/share)
    - Projected Profit: $141 (5.5%)
    - Downside Protection: 15.5%
    
    WORK
    - Shares: $3,348 (100 shares)
    - Options:
    -- $30.50 CALL 7/2 Exp: $475
    -- Out of pocket: $2,873 ($28.73/share)
    - Projected Profit: $177 (5.3%)
    - Downside Protection: 14.2%

Basically I'm wondering if this is a viable strategy, theoretically on July 2nd I should be up 5.5% on the DAL position if it's above $23 and executes. If it drops below $23, I'm still fine unless it drops to $21.60 in which case I'd be +/- $0. Obviously, that is possible, and this isn't risk free but nothing is. I'm not worried about needing to exit before July 2nd to get the money back.",options

Please pair it with your own research (fundamental and Technical analysis etc). Make smart play following the trend with proper investment time horizon beyond than just a day!

The options market is pricing in about a 4.5% move for the event. That's been declining throughout the day, call it about 5% into Friday's close. [Expected move chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-18-at-12.24.56-PM.png). It's had about a 3% average move over the past 3 earnings (all higher, all beats) with the biggest of the three +7% and the last one basically unchanged, up .02% the next day.

Decent risk/reward on what's probably a fairly priced move. It's binary obviously so any move beyond those long strikes and its max loss so obviously defined risk is key here with that 7% move in recent history.

Thank you all so much for your interests and suggestion from my previous post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jcn8r3/building\_my\_option\_toolkit\_spread\_discovery\_helps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jcn8r3/building_my_option_toolkit_spread_discovery_helps/). I learned a lot from each one from you. I have been busy with my full-time job, and I am still slowly learning python, javascript, and options during the process, so I am only making small progress every week. Anyway, here are some updates.

**Charting spread premiums**

One of the tools I am working on (see video) shows all possible put credit spreads of a stock given a specific width between the two strikes, and use tables and colors for easy, intuitive comparison. You saw this in the video of my earlier post as well. I thought it might be helpful to plot the premiums over exp dates of a specific spread. So this is what I did over the week. I know that the tool is not that helpful for those of you who are more sophisticated traders, but it definitely helps me a lot in deciding which spread and exp date to choose or to have a broad view of the options of a given stock. Again, it is not a comprehensive strategy solution; it is just a tool that helps solve one piece of the puzzle.

**Open Source**

I am making my app open source to open up possibilities for conversations and collaborations. I am just starting to work on this as a hobby, so please lower your expectation and kindly don't judge my amateur coding skill, though suggestions and recommendations are warmly appreciated. [https://github.com/hermeneuticlens/options-toolkit](https://github.com/hermeneuticlens/options-toolkit)

**Other notes**

I am also working on a tool that explores spreads not by fixing a strike width but by fixing the strike of one leg. I am also working on spread strategies other than put credit spreads, as well as integrating greeks, IV, open interests in a purposeful and efficient way, without introducing too much clutter to the UI. I have read all your comments from the previous post; I really appreciate all the ideas and suggestions and will keep them in mind as I continue working on it.

**Question**

I would like to provide this app as a free service, but the cheapest data source from CBOE is 2 min update of options data for about $10k per year. I cannot afford this price tag at this time. I am an international student so I am not eligible for most employment opportunities, including running my own business, and being a barista at Starbucks, for that matter. Do you think that it makes more sense for me to develop a desktop & offline version so that people can run it by getting their own free API connections?

Thanks!

1087,Stay away from this guy.

**Who is this guy?**

This person is a generic financial YouTuber who makes clickbait videos and sell courses on finance, specifically options. He's not bad at trading, but he pretends to have a magical edge when really he's just trading like any other options trader that isn't a dumbass. Most of his videos are just recaps of what he traded for a given day but sometimes he makes tutorials sometimes which are factually correct to be fair. However, he has a problem articulating his point so there's definitely less confusing and better alternatives on youtube. He sells a course (who doesn't) and has a fanbase called the cult, which behaves like a cult. 

**What is a ""ghetto spread""?**

A ghetto spread is exactly like a debit spread, except you don't buy/sell both legs at the same time. First, you buy a long call, then wait for the premium on your short call to be higher than the premium of your long call, and sell it. This results in what he likes to say ""you being paid to enter this position"" The whole point of debit spreads is to make your cost of entry lower, which ""ghetto spreads"" completely throw out of the window. If you want premium, you can just buy a call at a swing low, and sell a call at a swing high which will net you way more premium because your actually timing your trades right. There is literally no reason to do ""ghetto calls"", please don't join his cult.",options

1089,AMAZON EARNINGS,,181,g6ykws,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/g6ykws/amazon_earnings/,1587688662.0,"So I’m making the following assumptions here, follow me on it:

1) AMZN is going to cream earnings, not sure if price will go up or down after the announcement, but I expect prices to increase somewhat before now and then.

2) IV will expand up to earnings, then crash after. Any LONG option will likely have VEGA working in it’s favour UP TO expiration.

I’m not going to risk a few thousand on a naked long call, don’t want to fuck with Theta decay either. So here is the idea.

I was thinking a calendar call spread around a tentative predicted price of $2500 around earnings.

BUY 5/8 $2540C

SELL 5/1 $2500C

The trade would cost $118, I chose the strikes to negate the cost as much as possible.

This gives a profitable zone at expiration between approx $2100 and $2600 with MAX PROFIT at the short call value of $2500, and a MAX LOSS at $3330

Does anyone with a greater mathematical understanding (or the Tastyworks platform) have any tips for how to finesse this to maximum effect. Ideally I would like to be able to be profitable if the price stays flat for a while, and just collect the Vega as we get closer to expiration. Obviously I am expecting an increase in price but want to be protected against theta decay while the first leg is still active.

Can someone tell me what would happen to these numbers as IV increases? This is all based on current IV.

Thoughts and ideas on how to manage this as time goes on? Would i want to wait for expiration on the back month leg?

EDIT: For people asking me why I chose HTZ and SPC calls is because HTZ had been given bankruptcy protection which means they have been given more time to deal with the lenders and creditors. While they have been given this time anything could happen ie. someone could buy them out or maybe restrictions were lifted. Along with the market moving up and up HTZ resisting 0.80 mark and decided that it will not go down most likely. On top on Friday market moved up 1000 pts which basically dragged every stock on the exchange up making me close my trade in green. Whereas, SPG calls I bought because they were trading at lowest and then Trump announced that cities will be partially opened including malls will be opened soon. If you know about SPG they are the largest shopping mall operator in the US and own majority of the mall buildings around the country. Lockdown being lifted means malls and places opening which led me to the assumption that they will be back in the business sooner or later which turned out true for me.

**Full Summary & Rational For Trade** The end of quarter passive fund re-balancing along with slight or no substantial changes in market positioning will give the market a chance to remain relatively range-bound during the week starting 4/6/2020 ending 4/9/2020. This re-balancing post-quarter-end will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for a week selling premium writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the week. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down, but there is more delayed selling likely to restart after April 17th.

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound this week in comparison to the 5 previous weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion as a useful backstop) invite investors to reengage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the full week.

3 March 360 puts, 1 March 400 put

3 April 360 puts

When the market opened BA down about 12 percent, my account down about 3 percent. My BA delta about 250. Yikes. I was close to delta neutral on Friday and that has been my idea.

About 20 minutes into trading I cover the March 400 put for a monumental loss. Normally I close when the strike gets breached. I also closed 2 of the March 360s and 2 April 360s. At this point BA was about 379, my delta now about 45, which I saw as manageable.

Obviously that did not work out so well, because I covered sold puts at 379 and BA closed at 400. Still, there is a benefit to acting mechanically when faced with a three standard deviation move. The alternatives are to abandon the plan, to freeze, perhaps jeopardize the entire account.

I ended the day down 1.5 percent, long about 15 delta on BA  BA wasn't the only fire to put out. The huge rally pressured sold calls on other underlyings. With hindsight, it would have been better in this case to wait. But that wasn't the plan, and I had way too much risk after the gap. 

I always tell people to follow their plan. Altering the plan after a huge move on news tends to be a terrible idea. The result might boil down to a coin flip, but the long term damage from abandoning the plan is large.

If, God forbid a third plane crashes, BA might be gap down another 60 points in a blink. Yes, a low probability event, but not exactly a zero probability one given the circumstances.

Link to the article is at the bottom, but it doesn't have anything that this doesn't have.

&#x200B;

This article serves to introduce the fundamentals of Options Debit Spreads, along with how to use them effectively to generate profit.

## Introduction

With the prices of stocks skyrocketing and the uncertainty of the future, It can be hard to commit large chunks of money on buying Calls/Puts. Instead, Debit Spreads can serve as a better alternative, because they **require low capital**, and can be performed on **any stock/etf** that supports options.

If you have a strong idea of the movement of a stock, then you can open:

* Put Debit Spread (we will call this a “**PDS**”)
* Call Debit Spread (we will call this a “**CDS**”)

## How do Debit Spreads Work?

Firstly, it is important to break down Debit Spreads.

>*A spread is an option order that has* ***more than 1 leg****.*  
*A “debit” is an amount of money that* ***you have to pay****.*

In summary, a debit spread is a multi-legged option order that you have to pay for.

## How to Open a Debit Spread

For this passage, I will use an example to explain how Debit Spreads work.

>We are bullish on SPY , which is currently trading at $340. We think that it will trade well above $345 in 1 month.

Using this information, we would open a Call Debit Spread (CDS), because we are bullish on SPY. To open our CDS, we would need to:

* **Buy a Call at $345 for $7.50 debit**
* **Sell a Call at $350 for $5.00 credit**

Total Cost: $250, Break Even: $347.50 (will be explained later)

**Explanation:** We paid $750 (each contract controls 100 shares) to buy a Call at the $345 strike price. We then sold a Call at a higher strike price ($350), which gave $500 back to us.

 

https://preview.redd.it/tmnxxezyyjl51.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efdb5158a4b79cf0e659b836d65cd71465cdce3f

Our **total cost** for opening the CDS would be: *Long Call — Short Call = Cost*  
Our **break even** would be: *Long Call Strike + Cost = Break Even*

This makes our **Total Cost = $250** and our **Break Even = $247.50.**

*Keep in mind, this article will not go through an example of PDS’s, but in the case that you are bearish on a stock, you can open a PDS by Buying a Put, and then selling one above the long put.*

## Potential Outcomes:

Their are four potential outcomes of our example Call Debit Spread:

* **SPY expires below $345:** We lose $250, because none of our calls got assigned, yet we paid our debit.
* **SPY expires between $345-$347.50:** We come out with a net loss, because our debit is higher than the profit of the spread.
* **SPY expires between $347.50-$350:** We start to generate profits, because our spread is worth more than our initial debit.
* **SPY expires above $350:** We have already realized our maximum gain of Short Strike — Long Strike — Total Cost = $250.

These outcomes assume that you hold the spread until expiration. However, many people like to close a spread once they have achieved a certain percent profit. **I recommend closing your Debit Spread once it has achieved 50% profit.**

As you can see, debit spreads can be very profitable if you choose the correct stocks and carefully pick your strikes.

## Choosing Your Strikes

When opening a Debit Spread, the strikes themselves hold no meaning. Instead, it is important to check the delta, or the percent-change that is required to break-even on your spread.

For example, although we knew that SPY was going to trade above $345, our break-even was $347.50. Make sure that your target price includes the break-even price.

## Choosing an Expiration

Your spreads expiration is crucial for it’s performance. A spread with a farther expiration will cost more, but will hold less risk.

Personally, I like to open debit spreads with 6-months till expiration, and then close them 3-months before expiration.

Remember that debit spreads on weeklies are completely unadvisable, because it is exponentially easier to lose your entire account with a bad trade.

## Choosing a Stock/ETF

Because of the nature of Debit Spreads, choosing a stock is made easier with the fact that the price of the stock/etf is irrelevant.

For this reason, it can be beneficial to open debit spreads on large companies with strong growth outlooks. Some of my favorite companies are:

* MSFT (Microsoft)
* AAPL (Apple)
* NET (Cloudflare)

## Managing Risk

It may be common knowledge, but I would like to repeat it again. **Do not put all your money in one stock/sector.**

Although a company may look extremely enticing, it is important to diversify the stocks that you use in debit spreads. Keep in mind how much weightage you have in each sector, and rebalance accordingly.

## Conclusion

Debit Spreads are a powerful tool to bet on a stocks performance with low capital. I hope that you found value in this article, and thank you for reading!

EDIT: I was asked to put this into the article, as an explainer for some confusion:

Break even, max profit, and max loss values ONLY APPLY AT EXPIRATION. You can only gain the full premium, or reach your max loss potential if you hold your contracts till expiration. Many people prefer to close out of contracts in a specified amount of time, like 1 month, or 30dte.

Max profit comes with max risk and max holding time, so please, CLOSE YOUR POSITIONS BEFORE EXPIRATION. To learn more about this, you can see this article: Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (Redtexture).",options

Before that, I spent a lot of time consuming every bit of info I could. Up to this point, I have always been more likely to invest my money back into my own businesses. Now, as I get older, it's time to expand the horizons...

As I have been learning, I have been fortunate to be riding a very bullish wave.

&#x200B;

[This week's positions...](https://preview.redd.it/my7x2cjb6o541.png?width=165&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d45e0c12136cd9f2ff5c6d53111da3c7c8e6cf2)

The positions (as in the above image) I take are fairly simple.

**For example, this week with $AMZN...**

* **Monday -** I felt confident in a continued rise in the stock and started with a solid position and executed a 2 contract put credit spread (1745/1740) for $230 in credit.
   * After a day, the position held strong - AMZN shot up, and since I now have some ""house money""  for the 1st one that would likely hedge my position...
* **Wednesday -** I executed a 2nd put credit spread (1777.5/1775) - 3 contracts for $210 in credit.
   * After the 2nd position looked like it could be in trouble with AMZN taking a dip close to my 2nd strike price...
* **Thursday -** I executed a 3rd put credit spread on AMZN (1770/1767.50) - 3 contracts for $159 in credit.
   * Why? I still felt good about my other previous positions but decided to take advantage of the dip raising the premiums at a lower strike than my second position. I also decided this would further hedge/strengthen the position to profit.

As it stands now, these are all highly likely to expire at close tomorrow for some good profits in my pocket. Of course, anything can happen...

Without dissecting it, you can see, I did the same thing with TSLA - riding the wave up for some premiums.

&#x200B;

With a progressive positioning system, I have been averaging net gains of $1k-$2k per week from an hour or 2 per day in real involvement. I realize that's not (well - depends who you ask - lol) a lot but is what I am comfortable with in risk/reward at the moment.

&#x200B;

**Please do** ***NOT*** think I share any of this to brag or to boast or to pretend I know anything about what I am doing. I understand that this is a good time in the market. Truth is, I know nothing. As a matter of fact, I am sure I am probably doing it wrong. I only know my tech markets (as a tech entrepreneur) and know the most basic of probabilities (from being a big fan of playing craps for many years - haha) and I certainly appreciate the concept of being ""the bank"" in this strategy.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I hope to keep learning and practicing consistent options trading positions - even when the times are not so bullish and am trying not to get over my head with any of this. Like the title says - an early winning streak can create a false sense of confidence and lead to bad decisions. I'd love for any of us here to be the exception (if possible).

&#x200B;

If you are still reading this far - you rock!

&#x200B;

The real purpose of this is to express my gratitude to this community. I still have *SO MUCH* to learn and I have been a fly on the wall here for long enough and wanted to share some of my experience to anyone who finds it useful.

The development of the system was done out of necessity in 2010 when I had become ill, but over time has turned into a hobby. As such, as with all hobbyists, it's great to share your efforts for discussion and growth.

I periodically update the paper and publish it for feedback. Over the years, gathering community feedback has helped refine the many techniques within the paper and to also hunt out potential wipe out risk scenarios, especially vega risk, which is not talked about nearly enough! 

I don't mind sharing these techniques - I am an open source software advocate, which experiences have ingrained a pay-it-forward sensibility. The intangible benefits of helping others outweighs the risk to any alpha such a strategy may have. 

This is not the first time that this has been shared. Over the years, have discussed the concepts extensively in various options trading forums and with experts, to help de-risk certain concepts. It's been fun to help educate others on how the system works and to see some also learn a new way to generate income. Some of my friends trade this approach.

Their master trader appears to paper trade. No verified trades. I tried to verify them in an option flow but could not. I also once added up the capital required to trade the position sizes he claims AND to hold the hundreds of thousands of shares of stock he says he owns, and it's an absurd amount of money.  Will tell you he is a multi-millionaire, has a ton of exotic cars, and has a team of analysts that work for him. 

He claims to manage over $200m in assets for investors. Makes you wonder what he is doing in this group and if these ""investors"" know. He said he was homeless living on the streets when some Indian told him to buy LVS when it was $2 a share. 

They direct you to their personal youtube pages and affiliate accounts for other purchased services. For example, one of the ""owners"" developed and indicator for use only by paying members. The only way to get the indicator is to buy a membership to tradingview using the person's affiliate link. Another ""owner"" was posting profit and loss statements of over a million dollars saying the indicator is like magic. Anytime a question was asked about the indicator it was never answered, only said have to pay for it.

If you ask a question, they make a youtube video of the answer so you have to watch a free youtube video, and they get paid.

They don't post all trades, only winners. Losing trades are hidden. When they post the daily recap of trades any losing trades are labeled ""swings"" and you never hear about them. If you ask about a trade that wasn't profitable or mentioned the closing of you get told ""those didn't count as real trades, they were hedges against the market.""

If you were a multi millionaire managing $200M in assets for clients as part of a legitimate money management firm, would you be part of an online chat group and alerting trades?

I grew up in a single parent household that was drowning in debt. I knew I wanted to find a way to change my circumstances and I’ve been focused on money since I was in middle school. For most of my trading career I was focused on building a $1mm portfolio. I crossed this first goal two years ago and in all honesty - it was a pretty big let down. 

I thought that I would have this big sense of accomplishment and it just wasn’t there. It was pretty disappointing and more importantly I lost my “North Star”. I learned a valuable lesson though, having that account value as my target was pretty stupid and missed depth. What was it that I thought the arbitrary figure would do for me? Why did I target it? As superficial as it is, it’s simply a number I’ve heard all my life - being a millionaire. It doesn’t really mean shit. 

After that experience, I wanted to truly dig into what I’m doing this for, what motivated me, and what the point was. I started listing out what truly energized me. This mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics has completely changed my perspective and evolved my focus. 

I know many in this sub are younger and assuredly are focusing on building wealth. This is absolutely awesome. I started at 17 and am 29 now - couldn’t be happier with starting when I did. The main piece of advice I’m offering is to do your best to truly dig into why you’re doing this and try to get back the surface level “be rich” or “make money” concepts. For a little while, I truly lost my direction because I hadn’t developed any deeper goals. If you haven’t considered past a general $ figure, it may be worthwhile to do so.

1. Intro

2. Weekly Picks

3. Website updates

4. Today's Topic (next one is on interest rates recording today!)

5. Funny stuff (yolo options bets, etc.)

6. Outro

So here is a small progress update on everything that I've learned and so forth:

1.  Selling/Writing options is helluva less stressful and easier to manage when you're at work

2. If you get your mindset off of making income, but rather trading for fun it's takes a lot of the emotional side of trading out

3.  Podcasts are fun, and there aren't a lot of people starting them for finance, probably because people are afraid of making bad predictions, but fuck it let me be the scapegoat haha

4.  Podcasts are also a lot of hard work LOL.

5.  There's a lack of transparency of these elite traders making tons of money, which I guess I mean that's also why some people charge money to be in the groups.  Although I'm not elite, my trades are free to view; even my open ones!

6.  Selling spreads instead of naked options has saved me thousands of dollars;  I am not a huge fan of selling naked if you're not okay with losing the money you're playing with.  I had to be real with myself and yeah I guess kinda do care if I lost most of my trading portfolio

7.  Feedback is super important!  I listen to all my feedback and even have a segment on my show where I implement features directly from feedback and shout one of my users out

8. Consistency is key!  On both developing and trading.  I make it a mission for myself to work on the website every night every week as well as trade as frequently as I can.  Having the sense of community helps me be a better software engineer and a better trader.  So thank you for everyone for that

9.  MOST IMPORTANT: having fun.  i'm doing this all for fun which I think helps me be consistent and motivated.  I don't have a big corporation telling me what to do, I don't have investors to impress, and I sure as hell don't care about people watching me lose/gain money.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading; if you have any questions, just like last time, I'll answer any of them

&#x200B;

But I think there is a underlying method, although I have not tested it,  to how so many members on that sub are able to turn a few hundred or thousand dollars into fortunes overnight.

&#x200B;

The idea is, for low IV stocks , such as dow 30 stocks, you buy far out of money vertical calls 10% or more OTM before earnings reports. The spread should be as tight as possible but you can turn $50 into $5000.  So Disney is reporting earnings on august 6th 2019. You would thus buy the 160/162.5 vertical call. Obviously  this will expire worthless most of the time but the expected value over a long enough period is positive.

The second strategy is to look for mid and large cap stocks that exhibit parabolic moves (such as a 300+% rally in a 1-year period( and buy put options that expire after earnings, in the hope that the company fails to meet the overinflated expectations and tanks, yielding a huge profit despite the IV already being very high.  Or stocks that are overpriced. Such stocks can be found using a screener and sorting by greatest yearly performance. Unlike above,  you don't want to make this a vertical because the downside is potentially much  more unlimited. Do not use this method on internet and tech stocks, which tend to hold up well, but rather on things that are susceptible to being fads or prone to regulation and competition. So this would be commodities, apparel, biotech. So for example, LYFT reports earrings on August 7th. So buy the august 9th $50 puts.",options

1144,NFLX Earnings Trade?,,156,hsa0qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hsa0qf/nflx_earnings_trade/,1594907581.0,"Hi, I'm posting a few thoughts on earnings that are intended to be helpful in trying to gain consistency in trading.

With NFLX earnings today after the close, I'm seeing a lot of newer traders discussing buying far out of the money calls in the hopes that NFLX ""kills it"" and rallies huge after earnings.  As a word of warning, although this ""could"" work, it is one of the lowest probability trades you can do.

The market makers (and computers) have already priced in a $43 move either up or down in the stock.  So in order to make decent money in a long call or long put, the stock would need to move much more than the $43 move that is already priced in.  In other words, you could buy a $600 call, the stock jumps up $43 with earnings, and you lose 100% of your money invested in the trade (assuming you bought a $600 call that expires Friday).  In addition to the move being ""baked in"" the Implied Volatility is at peak levels right before earnings.  Friday morning that Implied Volatility will instantly drop back to normal, and the premium portion of the options will implode.  All in all, it makes buying an out of the money call a lotto ticket trade.

[The \\""market maker move\\"" is shown on this platform, but you can also get close to that figure buy adding up the at the money call and at the money put. ](https://preview.redd.it/cb1i9hx028b51.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4f351c719e9ff45671cbcf7d6ab0e535612b16)

Instead, consider what the market makers do for earnings.  They sell the at the money call and the at the money put as a naked straddle in order to capture the rapid premium decay after earnings are announced.  They make a living doing this.

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of naked options over earnings, so instead, I'll do an at the money Iron Condor (also called an Iron Fly when the sold strikes are the same).  This is selling a naked straddle but with the protection of long options to contain your maximum risk in case the stock does have one of those rare moves that is well beyond what is already ""expected.""

This is what the risk to reward looks like on a 1 lot trade on a $45 wide (expected move) Iron Fly on NFLX.  (To reduce your max risk, you can narrow the width of the spread).

[Max profit and max loss selling the $525 at the money call and put and buying options $45 out on either side to establish maximum risk.](https://preview.redd.it/6qyz6wg838b51.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a74d1cbf750af6d80ab2aaa551e476e5f980ed)

This is simply a bet that the move on NFLX is already baked into the options price, and by the time the stock opens Friday morning, it will be up or down less than the $43 expected move.

A few notes on this trade:

* It's not guaranteed to work, of course, but the odds of getting a profit on this setup is much higher, over time, than buying an out of the money call.  (And don't get me wrong, it is amazing having calls when a stock explodes - this strategy is more for consistent base hits than occasional grand slam home runs).
* Tip: If you normally risk $1,500 on a trade on a normal stop loss, then just line up your ""max loss"" with this.  That way if the trade hits max loss, it is just like hitting a stop out vs. trading too big and having a max loss trade be a disaster.
* The closer NFLX opens to your sold strikes Friday morning, or anytime on Friday, the higher your profit.
* If NFLX does open up or down right around the expected move, you can wait for retracements.  (The expected move often acts as support or resistance, as there is a lot of money riding on it staying within that range).
* Max loss occurs if, by Friday's close, NFLX is trading above the long options, in this case, $570 or $480.  I always position size assuming it is NOT going to work, so I'm not freaking out if it has a big move against me.  Base hits, not home runs.
* In general, I try to get out at 50% of the credit received.  In this case, the credit is $32.25, so my exit would be set near $16.00.  I've found that to be a fairly consistent level to exit if the stock is staying within the ""expected move"" parameters.

Hope it helps!

Edit:  Adding a screenshot of trade after the close.  Currently, NFLX is trading down around $475, so it's kicking me in the teeth.  I would need the stock to rally back to $500 at some point tomorrow in order to get a scratch/small gain on the fly.  If it opens up down within the expected move, then I might sell some 450 put credit spreads to bring in additional credit to offset the loss.  If it opens below the expected move, I might buy back the short put and let the long put run but that brings on a lot of additional risk.  Should be an interesting Friday.

[NFLX Earnings Trade](https://preview.redd.it/7bmg3kps9ab51.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=1658a25e46ee264ea96f09cf0c746d19d49bfcbb)

Edit: Ok now it's Friday after the close.  Did NFLX follow those ""expected move"" guidelines or not?  Here's a chart that includes the after-hours action.  After hours will usually push through the expected move, as it did after earnings.  Then, with the cash open it was back to ""at"" and eventually ""within"" the expected move of $43.  The move up to $500 allowed me to get out of the iron fly at a small gain (if you don't open near the closing price, the goal is to get out on a move inside of the expected move once the after-hours action has settled down).  Ideally, we open up or move closer to the previous days closing price, as that would give us the biggest bang for the buck on the trade.

Anyway, hope it's helpful in understanding earnings moves.  My preference is to sell options to take advantage of premium decay and the tendency of a stock to stay within its expected move vs. buying OTM calls and puts hoping for a move that is greater than what's already been priced in.

1148,Bullish Ideas for Intel (again),,157,jhyimp,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jhyimp/bullish_ideas_for_intel_again/,1603651169.0,"In case you missed it (and you didn't, you astute watcher of markets), INTC got knocked down again after earnings, just like last quarter.  So, just like in September when  I suggested [bullish option trades](https://optionsalary.com/cheap-chips) in Intel (Ticker: INTC) I'm doing it again.  Obligatory chart:

&#x200B;

[6 month chart of INTC](https://preview.redd.it/gtz5tt26cav51.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2c90a075d6b92d0d95e4553dfde4ce5b179066)

After last earnings cycle's drop, Intel basically stabilized and then climbed back, recovering a portion of the post-earnings loss.  We've again seen Intel meet or beat on its top line revenue as well as earnings per share.  The Data Center Group did come up a bit short on expected revenue and some point to that as the reason for the significant decline.  See all of the earnings details directly on Intel's [site](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1424/intel-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results). 

#### Trade Ideas

With the stock now back at levels similar to last earnings release, here are a few bullish Intel option trades for playing a recovery in the name:

* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45 put for 0.48 **or**
* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45/40 put spread for 0.40 **or**
* Hold tight until after the election and re-evaluate
* Prices are at the midpoint as of 10/23/2020
* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.

Selling the puts outright would result in owning shares at an equivalent of $44.52 if INTC ends below 45 on the 13th.  The immediate return if the put expires worthless is 1.1% or almost 19.5% annualized as this is a 3 week trade.

The put spreads cap our downside risk in exchange for just 0.08 and also limits margin.  If the spread expires worthless, it will be a return of 8.7% on the $460 risked per trade ($40/$460).  

The 45 strike is outside of the expected move between now and November 13th.

Personally, I've put on a ""half"" position and will look to put on more after the election.  I also added a few shares.

#### What's the downside?

Earnings Just occurred and there may be some lingering volatility in the name.  Combined with the election, another approach is to simply wait a week and a half and then re-evaluate.  Another approach is to put on half the size now and wait until after the election to put on the other half.  

Margins are down at INTC vs. one year ago and AMD is a 'flashier' name.  For put sales, I prefer the larger (INTC sells about 10x as much as AMD), slower moving INTC and its dividend in the near term, particularly now that it has gone ""on sale"".  I have and will continue to trade in and out of AMD.

Intel's valuation is well below its 5 year averages and it continues to grow revenue and profits.  Now is (still) a reasonable time to try and pick up shares or at least profit from its currently depressed price.",options

[**Microsoft (MSFT) has just reported earnings and is still consolidating within a 15 point range**](https://i.imgur.com/FZsCvFg.png), building up energy for the next movement.

**A break above $214/share would be a long signal**, with the stop being below $201/share. This gap of $13 between the entry price and the stop represents your ""risk,"" which needs to be sized to no more than 1-2% of your account value.

For example, if you traded a ten share position, then your aggregate risk would be $130. This represents a 2% risk position for an $6500 account.

Alternatively, a more efficient way to trade this breakout in a limited-risk fashion is with **MSFT vertical spreads using the 28AUG series**, where you can limit the risk/contract to *no more than $125/contract.*

Be aware of the 8/19 ex-dividend if playing call spreads.

If you are wary of the large drop off following yesterday's earnings report, it's likely due to Azure  expected growth under-performing (+47% vs +55% Est), but there's also a good chance that when cash markets open MSFT goes up anyway.  Even Microsoft subscriptions growth has dropped in half. LinkedIn also, which resulted in layoffs recently.

That said, they are in the right sector at the right time, so these fundamentals are less noteworthy than you might expect.

So let r/options be the one to enjoy this. 

Recently after Grizzly, Citron also wrote up a [report on GSX fraud](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GSX-Techedu-The-Most-Blatant-Chinese-Stock-Fraud-Since-2011-ver2.pdf). 

You can read up the report by yourself, but I don’t want to repeat anything in this report and want to tackle this problem in another way. My DD is a surface level proof to Citron’s report. 

2020 has not been a good year for GSX. It should have because stay at home order should have boosted their business. But short report come out twice for them and apparently they are getting [sued by VIPKID](https://cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1887344341/707e96d502000v34a?cre=tianyi&mod=pcpager_fintoutiao&loc=1&r=9&rfunc=3&tj=none&tr=9) for unethical acts and hacking yesterday asking for 8 million RMB (1.13 Million USD). 

The interesting thing I am seeing is some clear act of fraud just on the surface. 

Go into their website, you can see all the free classes have a number indicating how many people are signed up. But all the paid classes is not showing a number.

If you click into each of the paid classes, you will see some small text on the right bottom: 优惠活动中, 仅剩3个名额, which translate to: Discount, only 3 spots left.

If you check a lot of the classes you will see most of them are having this little text, it is always 1-5 spots left. What are the chances most of them have so few spots left so you can join now or never? 

Another very interesting thing is their app on AppStore. (This is a Chinese AppStore account)

You can see there are a lot of different usernames comment the exact same long review 1 year ago. So goes for the untrustworthy 4.8 start review.

Citron also mentioned there are a lot of fake comments in the classes itself, so seems this is a common practice for them:

Now let’s talk about the [CEO](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E5%90%91%E4%B8%9C/55090). He recently tweeted on Weibo about the situation. If you know Chinese, or use Google Translate on image, you can see what he is saying. He is basically saying none of these is making sense. But he did not give any solid number or arguments. All he said is a very emotional: No that’s all bullshit. You guys are so arrogant you don’t even know what we are doing. 

I don’t know what you think but my gut feeling is that he don’t have anything concrete to show.

Besides this He also replied with other [emotional messages](https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/968093.htm). 

A semi famous Chinese writer also has written a response to the CEO. What this says is basically: if you have concrete earnings, them US shorting you is a great opportunity for you, just go ahead and buy your own stock. Why do you so eagerly go on Weibo and streaming rants trying to say they are wrong instead of taking this opportunity? 

He also explained they are expanding to a very small market (I don’t know what that is) right now, an act of desperation.

I'm bearish on DoorDash.  I've been a user since before COVID, but really only when they offer a great deal - no delivery fee, $10 off, etc.   During COVID, our family has used the service a bit more - but again, with promotions.  They even offered a bonus $10 gift card when you bought a $75 one - even if you bought it for yourself.  That combined with the free delivery options made it cheaper than picking up the food ourselves.

## First a Chart...

Normally I'd start an article off with a 6 month or 1 year chart, but DoorDash (Ticker: DASH) just went public last week.  It closed at 189.51 after reaching a high of 195.5 on its first day of trading.  It closed today (12/17/2020) at 154.21, already off $35 from its first day close.  I think it has a lot further to go.

## Bullish On DoorDash

Why would DoorDash be a good company to invest in?  Well, the longer COVID lingers on, the more likely people are to want to order food and have it delivered.  DASH also has approximately 50% off the food delivery business, so it is the largest player in the space.  Uber Eats at number 2 has about half the share (I've written previously on my lack of confidence in [Uber Eats ](https://optionsalary.com/uber-earnings-play)and that extends to DoorDash).  They are growing Fast and people love to pay for growth.  Revenue through September was 1.92 Billion, up more than 2x compared to the same period in 2019 (Source [DoorDash's S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)).  They even squeaked a profit of $23M in Q2 (June 2020)!

## Bearish On DoorDash

They were profitable in Q2! During, quite literally, the peak of a global pandemic the likes of which we haven't seen for 100 years (despite my age, I missed the last one).  Their S1, right after touting the profit is quick to mention they haven't been profitable for a year since their founding.  

Simply, from a fundamental perspective, they aren't a solid business.  Their market cap is almost $50B.  As a point of reference that is bigger than Darden Restaurants (Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, and more). Oh and throw in Yum Brands, too (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and more).

### Brand Loyalty

I could not care less which app delivers my food, do you? DoorDash, Uber Eats, GrubHub, Instacart, or the restaurant itself.  I want the food delivered by whichever company the restaurant uses.  If it uses more than one, I'm probably taking the cheaper option.  My loyalty is to the Restaurant itself, not the delivery company.  That means they'll always be competing on price.  In a race to the bottom, generally no one wins.  

### Turning a profit?

There is an old joke that while a business may lose money on every transaction, they make up for it in volume.  With the exception of Q2, that has been the case for DoorDash - well, the losing money part.  What levers do they have?  

1. Increase the fee to the restaurant.  Restaurants are charged a commission in the neighborhood of 25-30%.  Oof.  In a historically low margin business, I can't imagine restaurants accepting that much more.  This is also an area where other competitors can come in with a lower price
2. Raise the delivery fee, surcharge, bonus fee, undercoating, etc.  Let's say I'm really fiending for some White Castle (no jokes please, Harold).  Right  now, I can get  pick up a Sliders clutch - 20 tiny sliders, please - and the mandatory 20 pc Chicken Rings for only 22.29!  These will be delivered to me in the next 44- 54 minutes for only $36.18.  Wait.  What?  There is a $4.99 delivery fee.  Plus the Fees & Estimated Tax - which to be clear, is just another 13% fee from DoorDash (picture below).  Then a recommended $6 tip, the only thing we really know is going to the person actually doing the delivery.  In other words, there are a lot of extra charges already built in.  And I can drive to a White Castle, pick it up, and be enjoying it (maybe) in less time and for less money, even factoring in gas.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/v055tx0yav561.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff10535a304f7eb99908ce7f630098a02364b606)

3. Leverage the Flywheel.  The S1 uses a great Private Equity concept, the ""Flywheel.  Basically once they gain some growth/momentum with one part, it feeds and grows the next part, which in turn feeds the original bit.  Let's look at a picture:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u0n12j02bv561.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d1ea459324c5e2e5de84808a8c801f3a636887

[Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

A fine concept, but my (small sample size) discussion with restaurant owners is they aren't happy with the costs, I don't want to pay full price, and the dashers are only making less than $2/hour according to some [studies](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/19/doordash-drivers-make-an-average-of-145-an-hour-analysis-finds/).   

### Restaurants are better

For a period of this summer, when case counts were lower, and the weather was nicer, we Loved going to restaurants (Outdoors, with masks, socially distanced).  It was terrific to get out of the house and enjoy a nice meal.  We don't go out a ton, but it is a nice treat.  We supported our favorite local restaurants, celebrated birthdays, and chatted with our favorite staff and owners to check in on them.  

When things weren't as good, we still supported our favorite restaurants and had the food delivered - and I appreciate DoorDash and their Dashers for providing this service. 

But let's face it. The experience is not as good.  The food is definitely not as good.  The food is always a little too cool, certain foods don't travel as well \[To the future inventor of a device that transports restaurant french fries and keeps them hot and crispy, thank you\].  Then there are the occasional mistakes that can't Really be corrected with food delivery.  You explain to my small child why despite us having paid $9 for kids mac and cheese she has a kids steak. First world problems, I know and I'm getting off track.  The point is, if I'm choosing between being waited on, getting out of the house, having better food and paying less -or- having lukewarm food and paying more, the decision is clear.  

Demand Will drop when we get past the pandemic.  And we will.

## So let's short the stock!

Woah.  Slow down there.  Don't.  There is a 25% chance I am WAY off and this won't age well.  DoorDash will be delivering Everything in the future from food, to Amazon packages, to newspapers and bottles of milk. They'll be HUGE.  And I'll look foolish.  And those that short stock will get crushed like TSLA short sellers (sorry).

So what options do we have?

### Buy Puts

You can always buy a put and profit if the stock (continues to..) moves down.  The main issue is that a put is quite expensive.  I'm not the only one bearish and IV is high.  A 1 month ATM put (155 strike) in January is currently trading for 16.85 at the midpoint.   At expiration, the stock would need to be below 138.15 before you were profitable.  Note that if the stock moves down sharply soon, it would still likely be profitable before expiration.  The option will decay pretty quickly, currently 0.25/day ($25), increasing as we get closer to mid January.

### Buy a Put Spread

Let's say we think DASH will drop and we set a target of 120.  We could then sell a 120 put to go with our 155 put.  The 120 put currently trades for 4.25, reducing our outlay to 12.60.  Now if at expiration DASH does end Right at 120, we'll make  $22.40 or $2240 on each put spread.  Compare this to the $1815 we'd make buying just the $155 put (again assuming a $120 price at expiration).

### Sell a Call Spread

Perhaps we are less confident that DASH will continue to drop and just believe it won't rocket back up in the near term.  We could sell an OTM call spread.  If we don't think it will go above its first day close, we could sell the January 190/200 call spread for 1.30.  This would provide about a 15% return on our money if it expires worthless.  That's also $35 out of the money so you could sell a lower spread and increase the premium a bit (and also decrease the probability it expires out of the money

### Put on a Poor Man's Covered Put (ok, a diagonal)

Popular forums refer to buying a Long term call and selling shorter term calls as a ""Poor Man's Covered Call"".  This is a similar idea only with puts.

Buy a Longer term put - say January 2022.  Then sell a much nearer term put against it January 2021, for example.  There are a lot of options (sorry) on how you can set this up to trade off the premium outlay along with how confident you are in a drop/price target and so on.  As an example, we'll simply buy an ATM put in January 2022 for 48.45 (155 Strike).  Note the IV is 73.54).  We can then sell a January 2021 OTM put and pull in some premium.  You can select this strike to balance the premium received but also with your price target for January.  We'll reuse the 120 target from earlier and take in a credit of Let's select the 105 strike for 4.25 for a net outlay of 44.20.

Note we have two different expirations and will need to manage it, especially as we reach January 2021 expiration.  What can happen?

* Stock takes off.  We lose.  Our loss on the long put will be offset some by the short put we wrote.  
* Stock REALLY plummets.  Below the 87-89 level, depending on when this occurs, we'll also start to lose because the position will start to act more and more like a 155/120 put spread - which we've paid $44.20 for and can only be worth $35
* Stock falls somewhere between $155 and that $87-$89 level.  We win 

Note if the stock is below 120, we'll need to either close the whole position or buy back the short call and re-assess.

If the stock is in our profit zone and above 120, the short call will expire worthless and we'll be left with a long put.  We can now take off the long put and enjoy our profit -or-

Sell another put at a future expiration and repeat the process all over again.

## TL;DR - Bearish on DoorDash

Fess up guys. You did this, didn't you?

>Neither stalled stimulus, booming valuations nor even a congressional report implying they should be broken up is proving any impediment to megacap technology stocks, which jumped the most in almost six months with help from newbie traders.  
>  
>The Nasdaq 100’s best day since late April came alongside an increasingly familiar sight: measures of share volatility, rather than plummeting as they usually do when stocks surge, rose in tandem. Wall Street analysts have come to consider that a tell-tale sign that burgeoning demand for stock options -- whose prices inform gauges like the Cboe NDX Volatility Index -- is fueling the gains.  
>  
>Such lockstep moves hearken to August and early September, when stocks and volatility rose together just before a swift reversal that sent the Nasdaq 100 into a correction. Then as now, the [market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-12/option-market-is-long-way-from-calmed-down-after-august-infernos) for single-stock contracts remains unusually brisk, a trend that because of its impact on dealer hedging is capable of amplifying swings.  
>  
>“Last month we had some distortions in the market which were led by extremely large call option buying. And it really doesn’t matter who it could be this time, but that phenomenon exists,” said Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC. “If investors en masse turn to the option markets before the equity markets, we’ll have a situation where the tail wags the dog and the markets moves in response to those option purchases.”  
>  
>Surging appetite for bullish calls among both retail and institutional traders has been a repeating storyline of 2020, with stuck-at-home day traders lured to cheap bets on tech stocks like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose single shares cost well over $1,000 apiece. Thirst for the contracts has the potential to ignite feedback loops in the options market’s infrastructure, where dealers must balance demand in many cases by purchasing underlying stock.  
>  
>The Nasdaq 100 rose for a fourth day Monday, rallying 3.1%. It is now within 2.7% of its Sept. 2 all-time high. The volatility index tied to it also rose, which is unusual. Normally when stocks go up, measures of turbulence decrease. But that relationship has been muddled in 2020: there’s been five days when the Cboe Volatility Index rose alongside a gain of at least 1.5% in the S&P 500, the most since 2003, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
>  
>Another explanation for Monday’s price action is simpler: recent underperformance in giant tech stocks. Before Monday, the large-cap Nasdaq 100 had trailed the small-cap Russell 2000 index by 6 percentage points in October, on track for the worst relative return in three years. Disparities like that signaled mean reversion in the past few months, according to Evercore ISI. The Russell 2000 gained just 0.7% Monday.  
>  
>Other factors were at play, too. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. -- which together account for about a quarter of the Nasdaq 100 -- each jumped more than 5% ahead of Amazon’s Prime Day and an Apple product event where it’s expected to unveil a new iPhone. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target on Apple to $132 -- about 13% above where the stock closed Friday. Deutsche Bank analysts raised their price targets on companies including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc., expecting a strong recovery for digital advertising.  
>  
>According to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, the outsize moves in Amazon and Apple shares were themselves so extraordinary that they could whip up their own volatility, thereby affecting measures for the broader Nasdaq 100. Still, he said, the stocks up/volatility up dynamic could be a warning sign for a reversal and pointed to seeming complacency in the options market.  
>  
>Take the Cboe equity put-call ratio, for instance, which dropped below 0.4 late last week for just the sixth time this year. The measure’s 30-day moving average has climbed from mid-August to 0.5, but is still hovering near record lows, a sign that bullish bets are still elevated relative to bearish wagers.  
>  
>Bullish Apple calls accounted for four of the 10 most-traded options contracts Monday as the stock jumped 6.4%. Calls expiring Friday at a strike of $125 saw 310,000 contracts changing hands, trading at price that’s more than quadrupled from last week’s close. Amazon call volume was almost double the average over the prior five days after spiking to more than 340,000 contracts Friday, the most since January.  
>  
>Likely adding to the situation is the coming options expiry on Friday, according to RBC derivatives strategist Amy Wu Silverman. That event can force so-called gamma hedging (“gamma” is a term for option price drift that dealers often seek to offset by buying or selling the underlying stock).  
>  
>To Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, elements of market’s today are reminiscent of August’s froth. Among them, stocks are surging on light volume as traders opt for call options over bearish puts, all as measures of implied volatility rise.  
>  
>“We are seeing some of the same ‘signs of froth’ emerging that we saw in early August,” Murphy wrote to clients Monday. “This does not mean imminent downside, because as August showed the markets can remain frothy for a while, but this is something to watch.”  
>  
>He’s not the only one on watch. Nathan Thooft, Manulife Investment Management’s head of global asset allocation, says the stocks up/volatility up dynamic has been a topic of discussion among his team.  
>  
>“There does seem to be something at play there when it comes to the vol markets and what they’re doing,” he said. “The question is, will we see a repeat of what we saw a month or so ago? I don’t know. Things sometimes repeat and sometimes we learn from those mistakes and they don’t repeat. But we’re looking at it and we’re talking about it.”

— **Pre-Market Summary** —

Two headlines grabbed my attention yesterday:

# [Gold price hits record high on new fears for the economy](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/27/investing/gold-price-record-high/index.html)

# [Dollar index slides to 2-year low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-index-slides-to-2-year-low-2020-07-27)

I can't help but suspect this is a zeitgeist moment; will these serve as a weathervane for what's to come?

S&P futures and European stocks slumped as market optimism faded during the busiest week of earnings season while Gold was hammered moments after the December future hit an all time high of $2000 following a record-breaking rally, with spot gold tanking more than $30 in minutes and silver dropping as much as 2% before regaining composure.

Gold hit a record high on Tuesday before the sheer scale of its gains drew a burst of profit-taking, with the volatility prompting the Shanghai Gold Exchange to issue a notice on risk prevention and express a willingness to take action if required. The dump in gold also helped the dollar rebound from two-year lows.

After rising almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce, gold was hit by a wave of selling which it pushed back to $1,915 in volatile trade. Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its accommodating policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long run.

""Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities. “The chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.” One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.

— **Trade Of The Day** —

The game of musical chairs continues with large-cap tech stocks; eventually the music will stop playing and no seats will be found before prices drop, but until that event occurs, most of the market gains are coming from this sector.

Today's Trade of the Day comes via NVDA who does not report earnings until August 13th. [It's set up in a flag formation with a lot of potential energy, ready to break](https://i.imgur.com/QCgwuCk.png). And as we've seen lately, stocks are breaking BEFORE their earnings date.

Here are two potential plays:

1. What makes trading NVDA a challenge, like every other big-cap tech stock, is the price of $415/share. If you don't define a stop loss, then buying just ONE share at $415 represents the maximum 2% account risk for a $21k account! This is where fractional shares can come to the rescue for small accounts. I can define a fixed dollar amount in Robinhood (or other brokers supporting fractional shares) and they will create a fractional share position equivalent to my investment. For example, if I wanted to create a [$40 NVDA position, then Robinhood would grant me .096 shares of NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/hKtKSEA.png).
2. Alternatively, I could still leverage the gains/losses of a [100-share NVDA position](https://i.imgur.com/QjJHWkf.png) by trading a **vertical options spread using the 28AUG option series**, going **long the $415 call** and simultaneously **selling the $417.5 call** as ""insurance."" This trade *allows me to cap my risk at $125/contract*, which would represent a max 2% risk to a $6250 account.

 In preparation for next week, I scanned the earnings calendar and I picked 11 stocks based on market cap and options volume.   
Then, I created this sheet where I analysed the previous earnings move of the stocks as well as the expected move from MarketChameleon.   
I, then, adjusted the expected move to reflect the worst-case scenarios.    
After that, I looked at the delta of each lower and higher strike of the expected move range and came up with suggested Iron Condors for some (5 of them). The rest are either too low in profit or wide bid/ask spread.     
**Please note the following:**    
1. The expected move will change in value as the trading week begins. (The sheet has formulas and will update itself).    
2. The delta is based on the last close price. I will have to update that manually as the market opens.   
   
3. I intend on buying ICs (For credit of course) 1-2 hours before the earnings announcements and close the trade at the IV crush. For example, if the earnings are on Tuesday BMO, I will open the trade on Monday (1-2 hours before market close). If the earnings are on Tuesday AMC, I will open the trade on the same day (1-2 hours before market close).    
4. My approach in these ICs is to play it as safe as possible. As a consequence, both max profit and loss are relatively small.  5. Feel free to create an editable copy of this sheet.     


The reason why I'm sharing this sheet is that I value your feedback. **I am by no means encouraging anyone to use these suggested trades** as some values will change as the market opens.

Everytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.

This is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.

Looking at some flow, look at $SQ’s run on Friday:
https://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf

This is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.

Paypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump’s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.

For example, Trump may go bigger than a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus.

As result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result. What do you guys think?",options

* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday. That is the bulk of the move expected over the next month, which is about 15%.

* Snap has beaten consensus estimates 7 out of the last 8 times.

*Neutral* \- The first thing to look at is a neutral position,  selling to both the bulls and the bears. Here are two neutral trades setting breakevens at or near the expected move. First selling the +21.5/-22.5/-28/+29 **Iron Condor** [(condor chart)](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-7.41.46-AM.png)

In this case the risk reward is $56 to make $44. If the stock closes anywhere between 22.5 and 28 on Friday it is a max gain. Any close beyond 21.5 or 29 and a max loss. The breakeven is 22.06 on the downside and 28.44 on the upside.

That trade establishes a range of max profit, for those targeting no move at all, with the stock remaining at 25 selling an **Iron Butterfly** has max profit at the 25 level with profits trailing off towards the expected move and losses beyond: [Fly chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-7.41.14-AM.png)

Both of these trades are binary, isolating this week and what is likely to be a mostly one day move tomorrow.

*Bullish*  \- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time, to August expiration: [Trade comparison.](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/2020-07-21-07-49-59.2020-07-21-07_51_19.gif)

In this case both the August **long call spread** (+25/-29) and the August **short put spread**  (-25/+21) take advantage of multi leg strike selection based on the expected move. The short put spread is ""selling to the bears"" and is profitable from 22.57 and higher with a max gain if the stock is above  25 on August expiration. The long call spread has a higher breakeven,  but by selling the 29 call at a high upside volatility, is much cheaper than an outright 25 call.

*Bearish -* The same is true for a bearish target in line with the expected move but the **short call spread** is at a slight disadvantage due to having to buy the upside call at a similar or higher IV than the at the money call sale: [Trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-7.57.12-AM.png)

 ^^March ^^22 ^^2020   
**The time for r/options to restrict LINK POSTS has arrived.**   
----  


Most images and link posts fail to convey essential information needed for an options conversation. 

- A graph of an account balance is not an options strategy.     
- A list of positions with gains or losses is not an options strategy.
- An image of a trade, without indication whether it is a call or put, or why it was taken, fails to communicate an options strategy.
- A question in a title, with an inadequate image fails to communicate.     
- A bare link to a video or blog post is not a conversation starter.     

**Why conversation? Why text?** 
----     

We're here to learn about options and trading from each other.   
It takes effort and correct details to share something we have learned,    
or to provide a context for a useful response to a question.      

&nbsp; 
**All LINK POSTs will be filtered (image/video/web page).**   
---
**Very few will be released.**   
---- 

&nbsp;   
**For TEXT POSTS:**  

**The basics on talking about trades:** 

- State the strategy and why you have it,   
- how and why the underlying was chosen,  
- the actual positions involved (call/put, long/short, strikes, expiration, cost),   
- the price of the underlying before and after the trade, 
- intended thresholds to exit for a gain and maximum loss,  
- and the dates and times of entry and exit.  
- Without these, we cannot have a useful context for a conversation.  

If a link is useful, tell us in a TEXT POST **eloquently and in detail**  
 what the topic is about, with trade details as appropriate, and then if still desirable,  
 add a link to a hosted image or video or web page.   

Don't make us go offsite to figure out what you're talking about:  
you have failed to communicate, and describe the topic if we do.  
And the post will likely be taken down. 

**Posts amounting to:   
""What do you think about _____ (ticker)""?**      
are not a conversation: they are a request that someone else think for you.  
Such a post will likely be taken down.  
Bring your analysis to the post, a point of view to critique and react to,  
and a proposed trade or strategy.      
That is the start of an options conversation.  
 

**Reducing information-poor posts improves the community experience.**     

The r/options subreddit has a future  and a thoughtful community that cares,   
and a population that returns regularly, because the participants bring something to the table to share.   
And have a conversation.  

I'm looking forward to quality participation here.   
I think you are too.   


-----

How to avoid having your posts filtered out or taken down: 

- Eloquently state the topic in detail.    
- State your trading plan, strategy, and positions.   
- Describe your analysis, for comment. 
- If a fundamentals of options question, post to the newby safe haven thread.

Totally new at options and I am in the learning stage.  I've bought one cheap $3 Ford Call just out of curiosity to see how the transaction worked on RH.  

As I have been reading it occurs to me that that the real money (read consistent profit) is writing options.  Obviously more capital is required to play that game.  Specifically selling puts seems particularly lucrative.  If I write a put, I collect the premium and if it remains OTM at expiration I have no obligation to buy.  If ITM at expiration I buy and now I own 100 shares of that company.  I could then turn around and write a call option on that same stock at a price that exceeds my cost basis and collect premiums until it is ITM. I then sell for a profit.  Rinse and repeat.

I feel like I am missing something. What is the biggest risk? Seems like you need significant capital to make it lucrative. So may not be worth tying up small amounts of capital for such small returns.",options

Starting with [XSP.TO](https://XSP.TO) and an average annual savings of $10,000. I estimate that, if you can capture approximately $50-60/contract per month you will be able to acquire approximately 15-20% additional shares every year. 

Now if you're able to compound this year to year, within 12.5 years, including your additional contribution of $10,000, you'll accumulate approximately 10,000 shares.  The goal is to accumulate enough shares to provide you with dividend income. You need approximately 10,000 shares to do this.

Dividend at this level: approximately 6K per year.

Income from premium: 72,000/year

Total position size: 400,000.

Probable draw down: 50-60%. $200K

Probable % of position at risk : 39% loss. 

How you would do this is by using the premium to buy additional shares every month that you never sell. 

Risks factors:

Problem 1-  Downturn in the market - no longer able to collect premium.

Fix - go out further in time to try and collect enough premium to purchase additional shares. In the event of a major crash, you will still be able to accumulate shares using the dividend/DRIP. This may offset those months where you aren't able to get a decent premium. 

Problem 2 - Over concentrated in one ticker.

Fix: Can reduce position size. Transition to selling puts on half the cash position.

Will the rug-pull continue or will we get stimulus into our bank accounts (immediate deposit to Robinhood) and perhaps our portfolio’s. The truth of the matter is that NOBODY FKN KNOWS, anyone selling you a subscription telling you where the market is going is playing you like a fiddle. Here’s some of the activity spotted last week, would be great to see some follow through after the last 2 green sessions on Thursday and Friday. 

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

&#x200B;

**AAPL – Apple Inc**

AAPL finally saw some YOLO-ers roll thru late Thursday into the close and Friday throughout the trading day. Nothing extremely specific, but the call buying was in a range of strikes OTM and for short-term expirations. Players looking for a short-term bounce in tech here as they’ve been beaten to a pulp in the last 3 weeks.

https://preview.redd.it/jfidvll03pp51.png?width=2040&format=png&auto=webp&s=4454f6b7fb5ad51ab70844f58c1bb3aa20b3a81e

**ADBE – Adobe**

ADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it.

https://preview.redd.it/62fnlua13pp51.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&s=841729d311c8e7305fc10857a9fd6282cb703a09

**C – Citigroup**

Volume in C (Citigroup) has picked up recently. Down 25% from the highs the financial sector has been under-performing (due to interest rates among other factors). Banks usually kick off earnings season which will commence again mid-october. C reports October 12 as of right now. Looks like the bullish option flow is a combination of CALL-buying and PUT-selling.

&#x200B;

**CLDR – Cloudera**

Some short-term bull-bets rolled thru CLDR last week. Possible base forming at the $10-$11 range and might see some movement to the upside on this call-buying. Pretty good volume of calls at the $12 strike expiring two weeks from now. Tech is looking for a much needed bounce, we’ll see how this turns out.

**ORCL – Oracle Inc**

Big-time PUT-selling in ORCL on Friday in some 2022 LEAPS. Players sold the $50 and $75 strike PUTS expecting ORCL to rise above in the next year + few months. ORCL has been trading in the $45-$55 range for as long as I can remember with not much growth in stock price. They’ve just recently broken out close to $60 range on the TikTok deal news. Will this be a catalyst to keep the stock moving up?

**PBR – Petróleo Brasileiro**

Brazil’s oil giant PBR, seeing some heavy bearish flow recently with some PUT-buying. The oil industry has been getting slaughtered since covid and these long-term bets (mid-2021) are expecting continued downward pressure for the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/6y5nfdbb3pp51.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f88d524d516d1b357e6814fd70db700d9f20249

**WRTC – Wrap Technologies**

An unusual ticker to see on option flow, WRTC (Wrap Technologies). Not much option flow runs through this name, so to see some heavy volume come through in call-buying caught some attention. Players purchased long-term (2022 expiration) LEAPS at a whole range of strikes in and out-the-money. One of the call blocks were bought for the $17.5 strike which is actually 150% OTM. This ticker is only $250 million in market cap, so quite unusual indeud.

1192,WKHS - Sell the straddle,,146,ih0fpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ih0fpr/wkhs_sell_the_straddle/,1598454171.0,"EDIT 8/31 12:15pm - buying closing at $7.05 for a $0.15 loss. I'll write a longer post mortem, but I mischaracterized the IV catalyst as the Lordstown public offering rather than the potential USPS deal, which very well may be announced by 9/31. WKHS already has a relationship with USPS and even if it has a 33% chance of a 1/3 share of the $6b deal, my analysis doesn't hold. 

&#x200B;

WKHS is an extremely nonprofitable electric car company. Sound familiar? Before you start loading up, there’s a key difference. TSLA produced $6.03b of revenue in Q2, resulting in net income of $129m or $0.50/share ($2/share annualized). [https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/2d27eb7d-849a-459a-b53c-4da2aaa6787a](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/2d27eb7d-849a-459a-b53c-4da2aaa6787a). That’s a razor thin profit margin, and treatises have been written on its ridiculously high PE. But, it’s profitable.

WKHS, by contrast, is extremely unprofitable. In Q2, it generated a total of $92,000 in revenue. That’s not a typo; they generated less revenue than a mid-level securities analyst earned in wages. That resulted in a net loss of $131m. In other words, WKHS would have needed to increase its revenue by \~1400x its current revenue to get to break-even. Not great.

That figure is a little misleading for two reasons:

a. WKHS had issued $41m of convertible notes to raise financing. Those notes have now been extinguished. When those notes were converted, WKHS recorded the difference between the principal value of those notes and the converted share price ($3.05) as an interest expense. So, unless WKHS issues additional convertible notes, the $124m of interest expense it recorded for Q2 will be non-recurring. This reduce net loss to $7m. Still, that’s 76x current revenue. And that financing will need to be replaced through either additional debt or equity financing.

b. WKHS owns a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors Corp.

Sometime in Q4, Lordstown Motors Corp. will become a public company via merger with DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:DPHC) ([https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0254/3229/3427/files/DP-LMC-Merger-Announcement-PR.pdf?v=1596472383](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0254/3229/3427/files/DP-LMC-Merger-Announcement-PR.pdf?v=1596472383)). DPHC’s claim to fame is that it will be first to market with a full-size electric pickup truck, scheduled to be released in Q3 2021. Lordstown claims to have received pre-orders for up to 27,000 truck, planning to sell each at $52,000. While the area will be flooded with competitors, including TSLA, shortly thereafter, Lordstown’s production facilities are “near-ready.” From their marketing materials:

• While there are a number of competitors trying to produce a plug-in electric pickup truck, many of them do not have production facilities

• Others, including Ford and Tesla, have plants that are currently at capacity and require significant time and investment to build plants and start production

• It can take over two years and require billions in capital investment to establish an operational plant

In other words, WKHS owns a 10% stake in a pre-IPO company that will be first to market in the fully electric truck space, and is itself bidding on various contracts with, for example, USPS. This article cites analyst consensus that WKHS will generate $150m in sales by the end of 2021. [https://investorplace.com/2020/08/wkhs-stock-could-hit-it-big-when-lordstown-motors-goes-public](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/wkhs-stock-could-hit-it-big-when-lordstown-motors-goes-public).

So, WKHS is a long-term speculative play with a catalyst in Q4 2020 and throughout 2021. My argument, however, is that there are minimal catalysts in Q3 2020 that should affect the stock price. Lordstown will not go public until Q4, and the USPS bid “is expected by fall” ([https://www.foxnews.com/auto/special-delivery-new-u-s-postal-service-truck-to-be-picked-this-year](https://www.foxnews.com/auto/special-delivery-new-u-s-postal-service-truck-to-be-picked-this-year)). Even if that bid comes in, the $150m figure remains completely speculative, at least for the next 40 days. WKHS’s implied volatility spiked in early July when Lordstown announced its merger plans, and has been on a fairly steady decline ever since.

Play: Sell the October 2, 2020 straddle. At the time of my sale, WKHS’s stock price was \~around $17.5. The $17.5 straddle generated $6.90 in credit, such that it’s a profitable play if WKHS remains range-bound between $10.6 and $24.4 by October 2. WKHS peaked at $23 on the Lordstown announcement, and has not fallen below $13.5 since. I expect WKHS to remain range-bound between now and October 2 given the lack of catalysts. On my margin account, that required $700 in buying power, with a potential gain of 100% ROR if WKHS remains at $17.5. I see more risk on the downside than the upside (i.e. a TSLA crash, a NASDAQ crash), but I do not mind being assigned at $10.6 for a 39.5% discount off of today’s price.",options

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

However I believe it will create a possible opportunity for short term options plays. As of 8:50 PM, it appears that the dow will open down by about 11-1200 points. This will likely cause panic and possible intervention from the federal reserve. This intervention will likely consist of a further rate drop of about .5-.75 basis points and controls on shorts. (Based on reactions to the ‘08 crisis) If tomorrow or Tuesday leads to rumors of a possible meeting by the fed, I would suggest picking up ITM calls on XLF and or XLK with an expiration of March 20th. I would highly recommend dumping these on Friday. In addition, should news come that rates will be cut and the markets rise, I will be purchasing XLF and XLK puts to be held into Monday. 

I am curious about this subreddits moves for the next week and possible issues that people may have with my moves.",options

Account starting value: $5,000.00

Has been a fun week, opened my first spreads, closed a few trades for a profit, and am feeling pretty sanguine about this whole trading journey.

This post is going to be formatted a little differently, so let me know what you think if you've been following these for awhile.

**Week 6 Starting Net Liq: $4,907.96**

*This Week's Positions:*
*Opened:* **3**
*Closed:* **2**
*Rolled:* **0**

* **Disney:** 3/20 DIS [Sold (1) 135 Put, Bought (1) 130 Put. Credit received: $1.36](https://imgur.com/a/t3RoyH8), 3/20 DIS [Bought (1) 135 Put, Sold (1) 130 Put. Debit paid: $0.98](https://imgur.com/a/nCerjlQ) **Net Profit: $36.85**

*Bull Put Spread.* I initially opened this position as an earnings play, as Disney had high IVP, and the position had a 67% POP, with an 82% P50 on entry. I was intending on holding through earnings and buying the spread back if it hit 50% profit. 

Instead, I had an opportunity to buy back the spread for $0.98, locking in a 27% profit after fees, without having to hold the option through expiration. 

Sure, many people would hold on, after all Disney beat earnings, so I likely could have made a lot more on this trade, but I'm happy enough to not be greedy on this position. 

* **Boeing:** 3/20 BA [Sold (1) 330 Call, Bought (1) 340 Call. Credit received: $2.40](https://imgur.com/a/VmXwSUs)

*10Pt. Wide Bear Call Spread.* I'm pretty bearish on Boeing, and it had a POP of 70%, and P50 of 80% on entry. I widened the strikes, taking on a larger risk to the upside, but also received a larger credit (Therefore raising my breakeven). I don't see BA moving wildly much *now*, as they have had multiple bombshell stories this passed 6 months or so. 

For that reason, however, IV was fairly low when I put on this trade, so I'm interested in seeing how it turns out. I immediately opened a GTC Buy-To-Close order to buy the spread back at $1.20, or 50% profit, which is my target profit for credit spreads. 

As of 2/7, my short leg has been breached, with my long leg currently sitting ATM. Should I have rolled the strikes down/out in order to avoid the low chance of being assignment with 42 DTE? Curious about what you all think.

* **Tesla:** 2/7 TSLA [Sold (1) 990 Call, Bought (1) 1000 Call. Credit received: $2.20](https://imgur.com/a/zHc0H7h), 2/7 TSLA [Bought (1) 990 Call, Sold (1) 1000 Call. Debit paid: $2.13](https://imgur.com/a/jQiZhSf) **Net Profit: $5.85**

*Bear Call Spread.* This is my ""Why are you doing this"", trade of the week. Tesla has given me fantastic returns on my shares, and the IV got to a point this week where I felt like I had to do something.

 I played around with the idea of opening a bear call spread in Tesla, and saw that the credit received was bouncing around wildly, from like 1.85-2.50 for the spread (I'm assuming this was because Volatility was so high). So I put in a spread for $2.20 and was filled. Immediately set up a closing order, and watched the cost bounce around some more, again a debit of around 1.85-2.50. Within 2 minutes I got filled for a debit of $2.13. 

Maybe someone can clarify what happened here, is this a form of scalping? Arbitrage? Did I just subject myself to huge Gamma risk for a few minutes? Either way, I don't think this will be the type of trading I do in the future, so I'll take my $5 and run.

* **USO:** My 2/21 $12 strike Put on USO is still deep in the money as I attempt to roll it for a credit before expiration. Not much to say about this one.

**Week 6 Ending Net Liq: $4,714.36**

**Week 6 P/L: -3.94%**

**Total P/L: -5.71%**

**My Goals (in priority order):**

* To not blow up my account
* To become more comfortable trading options
* To help others learn from my successes / failures

**Strategies Used (so far):**

* Cash-Secured Puts
* Credit Spreads (Bearish and Bullish)

**Lessons Learned (and applied):**

* Sell options with a longer expiration in order to collect more premium. (30-45 DTE, to benefit from Theta decay)
* Sell Puts on a stock that I wouldn't mind holding long-term if assigned.
* Trade more than just stocks. (Look into commodities, ETFs, and bonds)
* Close trades for a profit / Don't be greedy 
* Sell Credit Spreads, instead of CSPs, to free up capital requirement and put on more trades. (Less capital at risk)
* Sell securities with an IVR of 50%+ for higher premium.

**Future Strategies (to apply):**

* Covered Calls

*Future Pursuits (upcoming weeks):*

Below is a list of things I hope to implement in my trading in the near future;

* Roll CSPs when close to expiration, to reinvest capital and collect more premium. (Rolling for a net credit, if possible)
* Roll in one, two-legged trade to cut down on fees.
* Try not to roll through earnings. (On undefined risk trades)
* Use ETFs in attempt to avoid some large, unexpected moves. Also more likely to find liquidity.
* Look into Futures
* Look into Iron Condors / neutral strategies

*Please let me know what you guys think, any advice or suggestions are appreciated, though applied at my own discretion.*",options

Tickers on the watchlist this week: FUBO, GME, CRSR, FSLY, CRSP",,142,kpubtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kpubtz/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_loss_on/,1609711896.0,"I'm back with some solid positions I'm looking to open this week. I've had many people message me about why I don't post any losses, that's not true. Last week's ARCT rOgUe WaVe set me back about 2-3 weeks worth of gains. It was a big hit, but hasn't stopped me from continuing to open positions. I actually sold more puts on CRSR and PLTR later in the week. I [pinned an in-depth post to my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/aMereMortalxxx/comments/kmgs5r/arct_update_difficult_situation_but_still_holding/) on how I am managing this position without existing and realizing a loss right away. 

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

Additionally from grinding away at my ARCT position which I am down 50% on, I still have several other small positions that are being contested and close to my break-even share price. I'm still confident in them and will HODL until expiration. Worst case scenario is I am assigned and can sell a covered call 2 weeks out at a strike price higher than my break-even to come out profitable. That's the way it works.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**FUBO ($28)**

https://preview.redd.it/fdvw8wcjx6961.png?width=2206&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dead10a658ef89fe868f743f0095a788aaebd5f

What a chart on FUBO. I don't normally like catching knives with my bare hands, but I'm willing to test the waters and sell one or two puts on this stock as it begins to hit key levels of support. IV extremely high and I'll be able to sell pretty far OTM puts and still get nice premiums.

**Positions on the Watchlist**

1. Jan 22, 2021 $22 put sold to open for $2.50 or $250 premium. Return: 11.5%.

Break-even share price: $19.50. 

Selling puts and getting assigned means I would own the shares at $19.50. Share price is currently $28. Selling these puts means I intend to buy the shares at nearly 30% discount from these levels.

&#x200B;

**GME ($18)**

https://preview.redd.it/viyvkp4kx6961.png?width=2206&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d0937cd79ca4c41fe334f6693c6a2dfd923e34

Another ticker with extremely juicy premiums. GME's Ryan Cohen recently added to his position increasing his stake from about 9.5% to now 13%. This caused the share price to short-squeeze before taking another dip. This stock has about 130% short-interest, primed for a squeeze. I didn't like this stock at $22, but now that it's back to $18 range the risk to reward is slightly better. I can sell $17 puts here to collect about 12% premium on the position.

**Positions on the Watchlist**

1. Jan 29, 2021 $17 put sold to open for $2.00 or $200 premium. Return: 12%.

Break-even share price: $15. 

&#x200B;

**CRSR ($36)**

https://preview.redd.it/m16h64clx6961.png?width=2202&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e9d4a42767572ddee25c46084c8b2b4f88efbc7

CRSR has been staying in the range for quite some time. I wanted to sell puts last week, but Monday the share price opened +5% and I didn't want to chase it. After the last few trading days and the stock coming back down to my levels I sold a position on it earlier in the week.

**Positions I Entered**

1. 5x 15 Jan, 2021 $35 put sold to open for $1.92 or $192 premium. Return: 5.5%.

Break-even share price: $33.08.

&#x200B;

**FSLY ($87)**

https://preview.redd.it/ekjv6g0mx6961.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b7e40fc1e401df11eb0cbfe22869a80bf5faf3

Along with most of the market last week FSLY got the smack-down as well. It's testing the $87 level of support and the IV has began to rise once again. This stock used to have 5-10% daily swings and has since somewhat settled. I think selling puts below the support will work well for the short-term. This is another ticker I don't mind being assigned for the long-haul.

**Positions on the Watchlist**

1. Jan 29, 2021 $83 strike put sold to open for $5 or $500 premium. Return: 6%.

Break-even share price: $78.

&#x200B;

**CRSP ($153)**

https://preview.redd.it/u88n2msmx6961.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b009a47fae30743a00906ec6033dad5310503d1

Another bio-tech stock with great potential for the next several years. This is also another one of ARKG's top holdings. Not sure if I want to be holding two bio-tech stocks at the moment since I am still chipping away at my ARCT position, but I'll keep an eye on this one. It's nearing it's short-term support of $145-150 which could provide a good entry point.

**Positions on the Watchlist**

1. Jan 29, 2021 $145 strike put sold to open for $9.00 or $900 premium. Return: 6.2%.

Break-even share price: $136.",options

OIL Falters, again
 
Financials, Energy, and Materials Rally
 
The Russell Up, NASDAQ Down
 
 
Today’s market got off to an upward start and was + 470 by 9:45 but gave it up pretty quickly making the low of -120 by 11:15.  From there we had a rally that kept us between -60 and +100 for the next 4 hours finishing -32.23 (.13%), NASDAQ -122.43 (1.4%), S&P 500 -16.09 (.52%), the Russell +16.20 (1.26%) and the DJ Transports +89.90 (1.08%).  Bottom line here is that we had really split market with NASDAQ and Russell at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Consumer confidence fell hard to 86.9 vs 92 expected and Richmond Fed was -53 vs. +2 expected.  Market internals were mixed too, with NYSE 2.5:1 Up while the NAZ was only 9:7 higher.  Volume remained light.  The DJIA was 17 up, 13 down with the leaders MMM +28, GS +24, AXP +21, and DD and BA +18 DPs.  On the downside we had UNH -41, AAPL -31, MSFT -29 and JNJ -19 DPs.  Energy, financials and Materials were the strength while Healthcare, info technology and communications services the weakest.

On the upside we had HOG with a “not as bad as expected +2.88 (15.21%), ADS $47.60 +6.21 (15%), and ALK $31.58 +3.73 (13.39%).
 
After the close we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and after trading $1206.97, turned back higher and after hitting $1290 is currently $1267 +35.  SBUX was a slight miss and after closing 78.69 is now 77.60 -1.10.  AMD missed on expected revenue growth and after its recent move back from a recent low of $36.75 to over $58, fell to $52.40 and is $53.21 -2.29 (4.13%).
 
And, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Creative Realities (CREX), a small firm with a stock that closed $1.00 yesterday +22%, came out of the gate this morning unchanged and rallied on the news that it has a “non-contact temperature system” that along with its AI enabled software “addresses the urgent need for businesses and employers to build consumer confidence as the world goes back to work as stay at home orders are reduced throughout the U.S.”  The stock traded as high as $5.15 and is currently 4.85 +3.85 or 385%...Clearly a home run.

OIL, $112.34 -.44. Oil was a BIG STORY another day of liquidation that took June all the way down to trade $10.07 before turning back higher to 13.69 before closing -.44. Tonight, it is higher again trading 13.05 +.71.  The stocks were also higher with gains of about 2% and XLE closed $36.22 +.85 (2.4%).
 
  
METALS, GOLD: $1,724.40 + .60. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 today, I was a buyer.  We are also long NEM.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $7,780 unchanged. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today’s action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $8.40 -.39 today.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

My friend and I created a small tracker that tracks UOA in the market between $100K - $1MM, hoping to aid in our investment strategy and generate ideas. We want to share with you our summary today. Any feedback and advice are welcome! 

[UOA summary](https://i.imgur.com/e3eSgFT.png)

[UOA Graph ](https://i.imgur.com/kGYjDWf.png)

The reason why we monitor only 100k-1MM trade is because we try to focus on Smart Investor potentially with good due diligence. Beyond the $1MM per trade, it’s more likely we are seeing institutional hedging or complex volume based multi-leg strategy (which doesn’t rely on directional movement), or professional traders trying to delta hedge. Of course occasionally there will be good DD but it will be extremely difficult to filter them out and discover their true motive/directional bet (better off looking at insider/institutional shares purchase instead of option, most recent example being Michael Burry and GME). The numbers will be 100X bigger but doesn’t tell you anything super new most of the time",options

Last week I opened up my first account solely for options trading ($5,000 in Tastyworks).

I hope to update this once a week so long as people are interested (myself included), and as long as I don't blow up the account, *fingers crossed*.

**My Goals (in priority order):**

* To not blow up my account
* To become more comfortable trading options
* To help others learn from my successes / failures

**Strategies Used:**

* Cash-Secured Puts

**Future Strategies (to apply):**

* Covered Calls
* Credit Spreads

**Week One Starting Cash Balance: $5,000.00**

**Current Trades (Open):**

* Ford: Sold 1, 1/17 F Put @ $9.00, ~~16 DTE~~, net credit received (after fees) $5.85. Cost Basis: **$8.95 per share**
* GoPro: Sold 1, 1/17 GPRO Put @ $4.00, ~~16 DTE~~, net credit received (after fees) $3.85. Cost Basis: **$3.97 per share**

If assigned either Ford or GoPro shares, I will sell covered calls against them. (I believe this is referred to as 'The Wheel' around here.)

~~Week One Ending Cash Balance: $5,009.69~~

**Week One Net Liq: $4,994.69**

**Week One P/L: -0.10%**

**Total P/L: -0.10%**

**Future Trades (Upcoming week):**

To try and avoid IV crush, I bought UBER OTM calls on the day LYFT was giving their earnings.   LYFT obviously has a great report, which caused UBER to go up, too.    Sold the options the next morning (which is also the day UBER had their ER post market) for a 100% gain and avoided a whole lot of IV crush.  

I figure if LYFT went south, UBER would still have a lot of IV due to their forthcoming report.  I could still sell before earnings for minimal loss, or hold through earnings and take a second shot at a lottery.

The strategy is to open a Put Backspread (selling a ATM put to fund buying 2 further OTM puts) on SPY or Russel2k and aim for a $0 trade or even a tiny credit. To do so without having to purchase Puts that are too far out of the money, you open this trade when the VIX is very low. Just before the March crash the VIX was often hovering in the low 11s before shooting up to 85.

Obviously this is all in theory, and in reality is always more difficult to pull off.

This is a graph of SPY with the associated 312 & 313 calls graphed for the whole day.  Also included is a difference line which would represent what you would pay to buy/sell a vertical spread.

I picked this particular day because:

a)  Thursday opened to a very bullish open then calmed down.

b)  Thur closed at 312.23 so it split this 312/313 call spread and closed between them. (indexes are kept open till 4:15pm)

Overall I did this for my own knowledge on how prices move together throughout the day.  As you can see the pair price tightens up as the underling moves out of the money and visa versa. (.53 to .89)

Also you can see with a close of the pair at .17 a vertical credit pair would have payed off well!

I’ll try to answer questions about options trading, pay, work life balance, manual vs automated trading, any other questions feel free to ask.

Throwaway because some of my coworkers may recognize my username.

Edit: figured I’d add a pros and cons list...

Pros:
1. The work is highly stimulating and the days fly by (although I do work 10-12 hours a day Monday-Friday).
2. The compensation is very generous: a first year trader at my firm makes $150-$200k while a full time trader at my firm can make anywhere from $300k-$3M (partners can make more).
3. The culture is very work hard play hard which for me is a pro.
4. The people are extremely smart and push each other to work hard, generally trading firms recruit from ivy’s or schools with very strong academics (I personally did not go to an ivy but I did go to a good state school from which many trading firms recruit).

Cons:
1. This was also in the pros list but the days can be long and occasionally quite stressful.
2. Trading isn’t risk less and firms can go under especially when vol skyrockets like it did in March.
3. Not much diversity, most of my firm is white or Asian males. Not many women and not many people of color.
4. Some firms can be highly cutthroat and competitive, thankfully mine is not (that’s not to say it isn’t competitive, but people have the best interests of the firm in mind). However I’ve heard of other firms firing half of their new hires within 6 months of hiring if they don’t perform.",options

They generally don't have a stake in things either way.

What MM's do with regards to options, for anyone unfamiliar, is they write brand new options contracts. Calls and puts. They are, generally, the ones who are setting the bids and asks on the strikes you look at.

Yes, individual investors can and do write options, but it's very rare for individual investors to write naked options, which are necessary for people to have long options positions. There has to be a counter-party to the contract that is taking the opposite side.

How they do this is by acquiring a combination of securities that offset the delta and gamma of the contract they have written. As the price goes up and the contract gains a higher delta, they must acquire more of these securities. 

These securities can be some forms of insurance and derivatives, but the easiest and most common way for MM's to hedge their delta and gamma on a contract is to buy a portion of the underlying. As the price goes up, they must buy more to offset the greeks, as it goes down they sell. This allows them to remain price neutral.

At least a part of what happened today with Robinhood, WeBull, and IB is that the MM's those platforms use ran out of stock. Nobody was selling, the MM's ran out of stock, and thus the platforms could not fulfill buy requests. 

The brokers that stayed open for business had access to more of the existing stock, such as Fidelity and to a lesser extent TDA.

Tomorrow though, we may run out of stock, and people may be unwilling to sell. In that situation, there is no reliable way for MM's to hedge delta and gamma against new contracts, and it's possible that *options* markets may see a liquidity problem on these tickers for new contracts. 

Nearly 25% of all GME stock in existence expires tomorrow ITM if the stock is above $500, to give a scope of the issue.

This will probably happen at the same time that some of the short sellers are attempting to further cover their positions.

Pay attention to some of these tickers, we are likely to see some never-before-seen events in options markets tomorrow.

NOTE: BB has a much larger float and less total activity, so it's unlikely to run into this issue, but there could be spill over because of how correlated some of these trades have become among retain investors.",options

No notable plays for today.

Honorable Mentions -

DKNG closed at $40, still continues to out perform, with a 2.5x call to put volume. Call Ask was 28.2% however put ask at 47%. I'd say it looks like DKNG still has more room to run up, but keeping an eye on the put to call ratios and consider trimming positions when that change.

TLDR : DG, MRVL, VMW both should print if buying ATM Calls or shares outright.

I'm trying to understand how options contracts fit into this scenario that is going on right now with gme.

1. Short sellers are selling shares that they've borrowed from a broker at say 22 dollars a share in anticipation of the price of gme going down to say 8. So Joe bought them from Bob at 22. Now they're worth 8. Bob buys them back at 8, returning them to the broker, and pockets the 14 dollar per share difference. 

2. Problem is those shares that Bob sold at 22 are now worth 35. So Bob needs to return the shares to the broker. And in order to do that he owes the broker all the interest payments he's accrued as payment for borrowing the shares plus he has to pay an additional 13 per share to return the shares. 

3. So my question is what is the event that forces Bob to have to return the shares? Is it that Joe bought a call contract, let's say 1 call, and that call was at 22 and expiring on say 1/22 being they gme is now trading at 38. Bob is forced to then go out into the market to purchase 100 shares of gme at whatever the market rate is to deliver to Joe bc the shares he borrowed from the broker were just on lend. The brokers expects them back.

4. My next question is how is it that there will be zero shares to borrow during the day and then shares become available overnight? The only reason I can think of is that someone would sell their shares after hours thus freeing some up for someone to borrow.

5. If they are options contracts that are being exercised forcing shorts to cover than why do options contracts not help us now?

6. If they are not options contracts forcing shorts to cover what is?

7. If they have ""overlent"" gme shares I would think the only thing that would really push a short squeeze would be the exercise of a tremendous amount of options that are in the money? Because until those options are exercised the short seller will just continue paying interest. So wouldn't the squeeze be tied to a Friday in which there are thousands of itm options expiring?

8. I'm using Robinhood which to the best of my understanding does not allow short selling. As such I'm unfamiliar with how the actual process of short selling shares works. Is it a different order than say selling a call? What is the interest rate like?

Can someone help me out here and tune up my understanding of this.",options

* State the underlying ticker, strategy, strikes, expiration, price on entry
* What was your original plan? Did something go wrong and you are looking for help? Be specific.
* If you are exploring an idea, stay on the side of being more verbose than terse. If it takes 12 responses to weed out all the details, it's a shitpost (and you know what happens next).
* Want to start a thread about something else just to chat? Fine, just make sure you don't sound like wsb is paying a visit.
* Not sure about any of the above? Just post. The worst that will happen is it will be taken down, there's no public shaming. Send the ModMail, it works.
* Don't link to external sites with paid services. It's ok to mention relevant content in a context of a discussion, but link posts with no commentary are spam, and will be taken down promptly.

Finally, for multi\-leg positions stick to a commonly accepted form, like:

* 200/210 short call spread (or credit call spread)
* 195/200/240/245 long iron condor
* 205 **long** call

I tell this tale in the hopes that others can learn from my sheer stupidity, and mostly so that I can learn from the experience as well.  Today is burned in my head.  By and large, I have been, very disciplined as I've resumed semi-active trading the last couple of months after a long break.  But, I learned what can happen when your brain freezes and you act before thinking.

Without further adieu, my last three days of trading:

* Tuesday AM - Bought 5 VIX Jun 17 35C @ 0.50, expecting some increased volatility; the market seemed prime for a pullback with Powell about to speak and stock prices very high across the board; It was a cheap flyer at $50 per contract.
* Tuesday AM - Bought 2 SPY Jul 17 310P @ 6.63 - this was in my IRA account, same reasoning as above
* Wednesday AM - Sold my 5 VIX Jun 17 35C @ 0.45 - Yes, I did this BEFORE the damn Powell speech, and I did this while I was only down 10% on a $250 trade.  Why?  Because I acted impulsively.  The market was down a bit yet the VIX kept dropping a little.  So, I impulsively decided maybe I don't actually understand the VIX after all (I do), and that it was a bad trade.  I essentially cancelled it out and bought it back for a small loss.  I ignored my original plan, which was to hold until end of the week, or stop loss at 50%, whichever came first.  Those Jun 17 35C are now trading at 7.45 each, a little over 24 hours later.  I cost myself $3500 in profit because of one impulse.
* Thursday AM - Entered a TSLA call credit spread: Jun 12 1000/1010, believing that Tesla was also due for a short term pullback after starting the day sluggishly after the hype about breaking 1000.  I set the 1000 short leg for that reason, believing that would act as a short term barrier.  Stock was at about 992 when I entered.  Received a $320 credit, with max loss capped at $680.  Immediately after filling, I entered an OCO bracket to close at 60% max profit or 50% max loss.  TSLA rallied literally seconds later, all the way up to around 1015.  In that instant, I decided, ""hey, I'll play the momentum!"" and canceled my OCO bracket.  Instead, I impulsively closed the short leg, after which TSLA sank back down to about 1005.  I started feeling sick.  ""What the everlasting #%$@ have I done?  I turned a comfortably defined risk trade into a long call with now $2500+ of downside risk and only one more day until expiration!!  You royal idiot!!!""  All I could do was take a breath (many moments too late) and put in a stop loss order, which triggered about an hour later.  Overall, this trade cost me $2998.  Yes, I took a trade with a defined risk of $680 and turned it into a $3k loser in a matter of minutes.

If you're scoring at home, that's a $3000 loss coupled with a $3500 in lost profits - a $6.5k swing because of impulse.

The bright side?  At least I kept the SPY put in my IRA account, so that cushioned the blow of today's pullback.  But, in my taxable account?  I was a complete and udder idiot.  The $3k loss isn't going to make me have to sell the shirt off my back, thankfully.  But, damn, that's a lot of money to just urinate away.  I'm incensed at myself.

There are many lessons here, but chief among them: have a plan and **stick to your plan**!  I had a great plan for all of this, but I failed miserably with the ""stick to your plan"" part.  It's far too easy to sit there gawking at the screen and being reactionary, especially with ToS like I use.  Two seconds later, your trade is in, and you didn't even think before clicking.  Awful.

Learn from me.  Don't do it yourself.  

Cheers, all.  Stay happy and healthy.",options

NASDAQ at Another New High!
 
U.S. DOLLAR CONTINUES TO WEAKEN
 
 
Today’s market was just another day dominated by a switchover to focus on the FAANG and mega-cap stocks.  After a couple of quiet day the big guns took off again.  The star was AAPL moving to a new all-time high at $345.61 and closed not much below that new mark.  AMZN, with its new price target of $3,300 was also strong with a move to $2,626.43 before a late market close at $2614.50 +90.44.  Unfortunately for those invested in the big 5 or 6, the rest of the market didn’t fare quite so well.  DJIA -300.14 (1%), NASDAQ +29.01 (.30), S&P 500 -26.21 (.,78%), the Russell -29.84 (1.94%) and the DJ Transports -227 (2.2%).  Volume was slightly above the recent average with the A/D on the downside with NYSE 3.5:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 lower.  Unfortunately, the DJIA stocks were heavily stack in the loss column with only 2 higher and 28 down.  The big gainer was AAPL +72 DP’s and the loser, BA -95.

The other name was LAKE: Lakeland Ind., a maker of protective garments for use in treating COVID-19 patients that finished $16.20 +.45 before announcing that their production would continue for at least another 6 – 9 months, sending the stock back up to $24.97 before finishing $23.75 +7.55 (46.6%).

OIL, $38.94 +.75. Oil has managed to trade $40.44 yesterday and fell back to the 5-day MA and closed there. We then traded as low as 37.07 today before reversing late in the day and closing higher.  In fact, people came after every little depressed stock and many have moved several 100% in the past few days and they sold them just as hard today. The stocks were lower and XLE was $45.10 -1.76 (3.76%).
 
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,721.90 +16.80. After trading down to $1671 last week we had a bounce higher again today after testing the 1697 level. The action in the US$ is projecting higher prices for the metals, but it does not necessarily trade with the dollar on a day by day basis.  Support is around Friday’s lows. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM yesterday @ $58.86.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $9,805 +25. After breaking down from just over 10,000 and trading as low as 8630 last Tuesday we have been clawing our way back toward 10,000.  Last week we traded over $10500 but fell all the way back to the lows, but we’ve moved back toward $10,000.  We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $11.48 - .10 today.

Searched for this topic already in the subreddit and couldn't find anything, so here goes.

What is an example of a good options strategy to seriously **profit from the US Federal Reserve setting the Fed Funds rate negative (i.e. negative nominal US interest rates)**?

* Is it just to buy out-of-the-money calls for a way higher price on, say, TLT? Or is there a better way?
* Any good Eurodollar strategies to execute this vision?
* I heard that some sort of butterfly could be an inexpensive way to construct an options trade that profits in excess of 20x if nominal US rates go negative.

1269,"A Counter to ""The Options Market is Very Bullish Today""",,126,a44fu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a44fu9/a_counter_to_the_options_market_is_very_bullish/,1544218986.0,"I don't usually like to post direct opposition to folks, but I thought that this post was particularly troublesome:

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a431bc/options_market_is_very_bullish_today_despite/

/u/Dvdrummer360 saw that the put-call ratio on the S&P hit a mildly extreme reading today - 0.69.

That indicates that there are substantially more calls being traded than puts. He believes that this is bullish.

The problem? Historically, put-call ratio has been a fairly reliable **contrarian** indicator. That means that typically when you seem an extreme low reading (more calls than puts), markets typically react *to the downside.* The opposite is true as well. Very high readings (more puts than calls) typically predict moves to the upside.

The reason is fairly simple - the masses are usually wrong. All of the put-call data is publicly available on the CBOE website, [here.](http://www.cboe.com/data/current-market-statistics/cboe-daily-market-statistics)

[Here's](https://www.bigtrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/put-call-ratio-example.png) a nice chart from BigTrends that shows that equity put-call tends to peak (ie, show lots of fear) right as the market bottoms.

Point being: don't take other's analysis at face value, because it may be obviously wrong. This is a pretty notable case because we have 23 years of **daily** data points to work with. 

I encourage everyone to look at the data directly. Find the dates where put-call ratios went 3 standard deviations in either direction (roughly .55 for greed and 1.3 for fear). Then look at what the markets did following the extreme readings. The results will be crystal clear.",options
1270,Walkthrough of a trade/strategy I did last week.,,124,8f423y,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8f423y/walkthrough_of_a_tradestrategy_i_did_last_week/,1524760592.0,"For reference, this trade was in Soybean Meal options. This will be the simplest trade we put on so hopefully most people can understand the logic behind this.

For background, you need to know how an options spline/smile works. For those that don't know, generally agricultural options are priced with an upward skew -- general IV is higher among all calls whereas 30 delta and 15 delta puts are priced under the ATM options. Wing puts are still priced over. This effect gets less pronounced as we approach expiration (so calls 6 months out will have higher IV relative to the ATM than a call 3 months out, puts 6 months out will have less IV relative to ATM than a put 3 months out). The reason for this skew is that vol generally goes up when agricultural prices go up (fear) and goes down when it goes down (think the opposite of SPX). We will assume forward vols are all fair even though there are lots of seasonality issues in ags.

On Wednesday, 4/18, May Soybean Meal had large put volume. The volume was so large that this reversed the skew as Market Makers retreated aggressively -- calls ended up priced under the ATM vol and there was large long open interest in the ATM by Market Makers, so they were very easy to buy. Keep in mind that skew should flatten as we approach expiration, but it shouldn't flip -- this gives opportunity.

I sold several levels of 30 delta and ~15 delta puts as they were priced about 1.3x the ATM vol. As a hedge, I bought a few ATMs and got very long slightly OTM calls in the front month so my theta exposure wasn't too high. Back month puts didn't move, so I was also able to lift some puts as further protection. For those that don't know, futures can move different amounts, but agricultural futures are so efficient that the rolls/differences between the futures barely move.

I hedged these with short futures obviously. This position, due to the disparity in IV, allowed me to be very long gamma and long volatility while theta neutral -- basically a free shot. This is because as vega of an option goes up, gamma decreases and vice versa. Since I owned all the cheap vol, I was able to have my cake and eat it too.

Sure enough, futures are down the next day. The paper that bought those puts wants out and I see more opportunity -- I lift nearly all of his puts as he offers them (knowing that everyone is short these and as we approach expiration, margin requirements are going to get very stiff as downticks will raise your margin exponentially with short puts). I buy them back at lower IV than I sold them at and obviously make on the long gamma and futures I sold as well. Sure enough, other MMs come in to puke puts for even higher IVs than I sold the day before, and I roll out the position again.

Friday comes and these skews have to flatten as they settle into the futures. Futures are down again in the morning, and I buy back a bunch with my crazy amount of gamma. Remember that gamma hedging is exponential -- if I cover my deltas every ten ticks for example, I was making $6000 each time, but at 20 ticks, I was making ~$24,000 so gamma hedging can be a bit of a crapshoot on how long you can hold out.

Some other paper sees the crazy skews and decides to buy the ATMs and slightly OTM calls as they're cheap relative. I sell a few of these to reduce risk, but unfortunately, I decide that they're still cheap and want to hold on for a big pay day. Futures end up ripping up and sit on my cheap long -- this was great early in the day (I think my position was up around $20k-$30k at this time) but the future ends up sitting on my long for the rest (giving me tons of long theta unfortunately) that I end up eating. Sucks, but sometimes I hold out on these types of positions and make $50k or more.

Hope this explanation is simple enough for most to understand and please feel free to ask questions.

I don't see my call being hit as it is literally 50% above the price and set to expire in two weeks. But I don't think it will jump 50% in a month either.

Currently, I can buy back my calls for 3k at a 2k loss....but then sell the same strike a month out for nearly 9k.  For a hefty profit of almost 7k. (Like two months worth of salary)

If I get called away before then, I'm fine...huge profit and I'm happy with it. But I'd love the extra premium on top of it. Also, I'd like to avoid incurring a capital gains tax for 2020 and instead do the sale in 2021 to balance out with the inevitable losses.

However, PLAY is up 50%+ just today, based on no catalyst news. This is a clear dead cat bounce. 

Shares of PLAY fell from ~$48 down to ~$5 in a matter of a month. Dave and Buster’s lost 90% of its stock value since Feb 21. Most of this drop was attributed to the Coronavirus fears.

5 days ago, shares of PLAY jumped after management announced a “poison pill” plan. What is a poison pill?

A poison pill is a somewhat controversial corporate defense strategy companies use to prevent a quiet takeover. An investor could theoretically start gobbling up shares on the open market at these low prices without one, meaning existing shareholders wouldn’t get any sort of premium for their stock. So companies cap those shares. 

In simple terms, they limited the amount of shares one person/entity could purchase to 15% of total shares available to prevent a takeover of company stock due to the cheap trading price. 

As a result of this new plan, shares jumped up ~60%. Such a jump makes sense. 

What doesn’t make sense is... 5 days later, shares are suddenly up 50%+ for the day for no apparent reason. It’s clear this is a dead cat bounce (a temporary recovery in share prices after a substantial fall, caused by speculators buying in order to cover their positions). There will definitely be a pullback. I would enter put positions EOD today.

Just dropping in a quick strategic analysis on Nokia given the number of questions I'm receiving on it. The details of the discussion are applicable for the week ahead and can be found below:

**Expected move:** \+/- $3.20 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $9.70

**Lower Expected move:** $4.30

**Potential move:** \+/- $5.30 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $11.80

**Lower Expected move:** $4.25

**Historical Volatility:** 49.9%

**Implied Volatility:** 362.1%

**Daily implied move:** \+/- 22.63%

**Put-To-Call Interest:** 0.23

**10-year high:** $11.75 (Feb 7, 2011)

**5-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**1-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**Bullish Trade idea:**

* Long Equity @ $6.50
* Sell $10 strike Covered Calls for Feb 5, 2021 expiration for $2.00
* Cost basis on stock: $4.50
* As long as IV remains elevated, continue selling OTM covered calls to gradually reduce cost basis
* Downside risk is to $3.30 area, which is strong support
* If the stock is called away at $10, a realized return of $10 minus $4.50 = $5.50 is generated
* Upside of $5.50 / $4.50 = 122% in just over a week

**Trade Modifications/Adjustments:**

* Purchase 1/2 desired position above
* Sell 1/2 desired position in cash secured puts at the $5 strike for Feb 5, 2021 for $0.95
* Cost basis on stock declines to $3.55, which is near support from lows seen in Nov 2020

**Other considerations:**

* Short float is low at 0.94%, which negates the potential for a short squeeze - organic buying is required to push the stock higher
* Next earnings report should occur in the next 2 weeks
* Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment
* Nokia will be a big player in 5G rollouts globally as well as IoT

Criteria for selecting Bullish Options Plays:

* 500MM + Market Cap
* Average Daily Volume 5MM +
* Uptrend detected

Using these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of these plays is that the stock only needs to move up a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity.

**1) Wells Fargo $WFC \[BANKING\]**

Wells just got hammered after an expected poor earnings. This makes it a prime candidate for upward movement.

Bullish Wells Fargo Case:

Wells has a history of prudent underwriting, and we are probably closer than not to a turn in the credit cycle.

Wells Fargo's retail branch structure, advisory network, product offerings, and share in small and medium-size enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.

Wells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.

[Wells Fargo Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/3f8ujvv2ewa51.png?width=3338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b461e92145d6899d7687ad57875c88594d0ac975)

Meets Criteria?

&#x200B;

* 500MM + Market Cap \[99B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[46M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Bounced off 52Wk Low as support\]
* \*\*Within 10% of 52 Week Low \[52 Week Low was $22, WFC is trading at $24.14\]

[$WFC Overlay with $JPM - The charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/ig0t44y4ewa51.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=689f9828b64c20c7be6b9bd072450fedac1e5668)

As a big 4 bank, it is impossible for the Fed to allow WFC to go down. They have a good balance sheet, with a P/E ratio of 8.9, down from 11. The lower P/E ratio alone will bring in more long-term investors. If that isn't enough to make you comfortable, WFC offers a whopping 8% dividend yield, making it even more attractive.

This is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.

Let's take a look at options on $WFC, which I found using my unusual options scanner:

[Big Bullish bets for October 16 2020, 2 days after their next earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/9mcjifp6ewa51.png?width=3354&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9e2026e3e5ed0104617eed11e8da53811e6b35b)

These huge bets range from $25 to $30, 3 months down the line. This averages to a $2.5, or 11% increase over the next 3 months. With this information, I propose:

*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*

*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*

I am currently invested in $WFC stock, and hold the $30 Oct 16 Calls.

**2) Twitter $TWTR \[Technology\]**

Twitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:

[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)

This is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months.

Bullish Twitter Case:

Investments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.

The deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.

Growth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.

[Twitter Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/h0s26zv9ewa51.png?width=3354&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1918faa353fcf0a92faa3f80688487534c10e73)

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[27B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[30M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Strong upward trend since March\]

[$TWTR Overlay with $FB - the charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/h1dw581dewa51.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=6768d69d773bcacb3889bfdc8e8aba142bbebb88)

The value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.

This is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.

Let's take a look at options on $TWTR, which I found using my unusual options scanner:

[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/59zizipeewa51.png?width=2988&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dddcc03302fc0afebb346ad1c8f43a956f9e72e)

[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/xr249owgewa51.png?width=2988&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b831b18eb55a5753384dbcd300700d2410f1bf8)

These bets were placed BEFORE COVID, and $TWTR is trading at the same price as when these were placed. The strikes range from $40 to $60, 6 months down the line. Taking a Strike of $40, that is 15% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.

With this information, I propose:

*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*

*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*

Buying $40 Jan 15 2020 Calls are only $20 more for an extra month. Look to close these after their earnings next quarter, when they will likely announce the subscription platform.

I am currently invested in $TWTR stock, and hold the $40 Dec 18 Calls.

**3) Southwest Airlines $LUV \[AIRLINES\]**

Warren Buffet and COVID have caused investors to turn a nose up at airline stocks. I don't blame them - the uncertainty will affect airlines more than most other industries. That said, don't miss this opportunity to profit off Southwest Airlines, as they have the best balance sheet in the industry.

Bullish Southwest Airlines Case:

Southwest enjoys the strongest brand in the industry thanks to its simple fare prices, free checked bags, and solid customer service. This brand equity will enable it to continue growing faster than peers and support unit revenue.

Mergers among Southwest's competitors will engender pricing power for the airlines, and oil prices will remain low for longer, boosting Southwest's top and bottom lines.

Southwest's aggressive expansion will continue, driving growth at the carrier.

[Southwest Airlines Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/infcvuqiewa51.png?width=3246&format=png&auto=webp&s=2991f099086973e667d6da4803aefb6dcd8fa64d)

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[20B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[15M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Strong upward trend since June\]

[$LUV Overlay with $AAL and $DAL - Delta and American have been hit worse than Southwest for a reason.](https://preview.redd.it/xfy42kdkewa51.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=66499e33390418d218c222b558cd13424b9a3209)

$LUV is performing better than its competitors, with higher lows and higher highs when comparing the charts. With the best balance sheet, its exposure to oil has been proven to be overcome since the whole oil futures fiasco. They have been prepped for the second wave and are most likely to weather the storm out of all the airlines.

My options scanner did not find any significant options data for $LUV.

I propose:

*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*

*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*

I am currently invested in $LUV stock.

**4) Ericsson $ERIC \[Telecommunications Equipment\]**

With growing tensions between the US and China, it is unlikely Huawei will be allowed to provide 5G infrastructure. The UK just announced that Huawei will NOT be providing 5G infrastructure, so Ericsson is poised to seize a huge market share.

Bullish Ericsson case:

Income sources could diversify as licensing revenue from 5G patents may grow through applications outside of Ericsson's handset manufacturer agreements.

5G may afford Ericsson a longer spending cycle and higher equipment demand than previous wireless generations. Additionally, 5G should create more use cases for Ericsson's software and services within Internet of Things device networks.

Ericsson's turnaround measures are happening at an opportune time. Management's focused strategy should expand operating margins while 5G infrastructure spending increases top-line results.

[Ericsson Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/utcfp62mewa51.png?width=3236&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b62bffb1ec2fb915dbc8d11aa3b2b501f188b1f)

Meets Criteria?

* 500MM + Market Cap \[29B\]
* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \[13M\]
* Uptrend detected \[Strong upward trend since March, even stronger after UK Huawei announcement\]

[$ERIC Overlay with $NOK - Both stocks are strongly trending upward, with almost 100&#37; gains since march.](https://preview.redd.it/bv5ozwmnewa51.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=805b65f5b4f2a452677147a2f6f118d7cfd00d59)

$ERIC is poised to bank on 5G since Huawei is being punished in retaliation to Chinese handling of Hong Kong. Expect more growth as infrastructure expands and Apple announces their 5G line this fall. Source: [https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-rumors-5g-release-camera-specs-2019-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-rumors-5g-release-camera-specs-2019-6)

My options scanner did not find any significant options data for $ERIC.

I propose:

*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, trading at $0.50 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*

I am no longer invested in $ERIC stock - truly kicking myself for selling, because I had a great cost basis a year ago. Regardless, I am picking up these calls.

**Conclusion**

Based on my research, $WFC, $TWTR, $LUV, and $ERIC are poised for big gains over the next 2 quarters. All the plays have a 25% chance of being ITM, but do not need to be ITM to be extremely profitable.

**TL,DR:**

*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*

*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*

I don't really care what the company is, what it sells, and what it's balance sheet looks like.  I use the random walk theory of stock price movement and efficient market hypothesis.  So far, my strategy seems to work pretty well for any stock that meets entry criteria, in any market condition (bear, bull, flat, high IV, low IV).

I'm still working on formalizing it (hopefully enough that I can write a screening program to automate it), but here's what I have written out so far:

- Check that next earnings report is at least 45 days away, and there hasn't been a report in the last 10 days.
- Look at the EMA20, EMA100, spot price, and MACD12,26,9 histogram.  If the Spot>EMA20>EMA100, and MACDHist>0, and MACDHist trend for the last 10 days is upwards, then I'm bullish.  Reverse all that for bearish.  If any one of those is off or not conclusive, then I skip out on that security.
- Combine my bearish/bullish stance and IVR for what vertical spread to place (bull + low IVR = long call spread, bull + high IVR = short put spread, bear + low IVR = long put spread, bear + high IVR = short call spread).
- Gather all trades at 20-35 DTE and 66-72% POP
- Choose the trade with the highest Max Profit:Max Loss ratio
- Is that ratio >0.18?
- Select a quantity that puts max loss at no more than 10% of my total portfolio (there is a minimum that's some manual touchy-feely based on Max Profit:Max Loss ratio when fees and slippage are taken into account, as well as total capital utilization in the portfolio)
- Place the trade!

- Close out when unrealized profit reaches 50% of Max Profit or when unrealized loss reaches 150% Max Profit.  If POP at an unrealized profit of 50% of Max Profit is >85%, stay in until POP <85% or when unrealized profit is 75% Max Profit.

What I still need to add into the algorithm (I do this stuff naturally right now, but want to find a place in the flowchart that makes sense when automating):

- Where do I check liquidity and bid/ask spread?  I use the TastyWorks liquidity rank (the 4 stars), but generally I'm looking for high volume on the underlying.  For bid/ask spread, I look for a few pennies, ~~out to about 100% of the bid~~*(not sure what my upper limit is.  I think I've traded some TSLA with a spread of around $1.50-$2.50 before, but it's rare to be more than $.10 spread)* (eg, $.50-$1.00 or $1.00-$2.00).  The tighter, the better.  Maybe I can use this to rank all possible trades and just choose the top few that I don't already have positions on?
- How do I choose entry price?  On liquid, tight spread trades, I generally enter at about $.01-$.02 worse than the mid price.  Not sure what I'm doing for less liquid markets and need to think about it and study my trades.  I'm thinking it will be some maximum percent away from the mid price (eg, mid-20% of the spread.  So on a long position on a $.90-$1.10, I would enter a limit at $1.02)
- I'm also considering adding a closing contingency if the spot POP drops below 55%.  Not sure if my POP has ever gotten there, or what my losses are when it reaches that, or what my max loss that I've closed for was (and what the POP at that point was).

Any input or discussion from you guys to help me tweak this would be helpful.  I'm not looking to get rich or play the lottery.  I prefer the slow and steady approach.  A consistent win rate and steady increase in my account is what I am for.

EDIT:  bears =/= bulls

EDIT2:  I have about 120+ trades so far, and the last 4-5 dozen have followed this pretty closely (vs when I was still developing it and throwing in all kinds of random 1-off lottery tickets, covered calls, or stock trades).

However there is some promising short term opportunity out there in case you're uneasy with managing your FOMO of jumping into a company that has run +70% over the last week.

You may be sick of hearing about SPACs in 2020, but do try to keep an open mind in that they are not all created equally. There are some fantastic companies coming down the SPAC pipeline now and in the future.

I've recently traded SBE, DPHC (now RIDE), SPAQ (now FSR), KCAC (now QS) with a mixture of shares and options and have done extremely well. In fact, r/options has been the source of my finding out about many of these great companies ahead of time. The trick with them is getting it while they are cheap, riding the hype to merger and selling off before it begins to cool.

Right now I believe there are some very promising opportunities out there today that have still not had a significant run up (SBE being the exception). I encourage you to do your own DD on each of these companies before adding them to your portfolio:

**Short Term Plays:**

* **HCAC** \- Soon to be Canoo, an LA based Electric Vehicle company. This SPAC has been left behind in the EV run-ups as of late and has a lot of upside. It's also one of the few EV companies generating revenues.   
As of this writing it is trading around $13.00 AH, with a floor set around $10. The current business combination date for this is by December 31st (assuming no extension will be filed).   
\-I've taken a heavy shares and options position on this, with ITM calls expiring in Feb and May. This company has not had the same level of coverage that Lordstown and Fisker have so it may take time after the merger to begin building momentum.
* **GMHI** \- Soon to be Luminar, a Lidar technology company that will be used for autonomous driving in vehicles. While not strictly an EV play, there is still an association. Backed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal, and more recently, Palantir).   
The vote for the combination is scheduled for December 1st. Assuming the vote approves the merger, I would expect a pop on the 2nd which may continue to rise over the following days.   
\-I've taken a short term options position on this with ITM/ATM calls expiring December 18th.

**Medium/Long Term Plays:**

* **NOVS -** One word: AgTech. If you're unfamiliar it stands for Sustainable Agricultural Technology, and it is very likely to be a term we hear ad nauseam over the course of the next decade. One company in particular is positioning itself as a leader and is working to turn the Appalachian region into the hub of this industry; AppHarvest.   
Again, I highly recommend you look the company up and do your own DD but I am absolutely in love with them. The only problem is that I don't necessarily see this one popping in the same vain of EV's at merger. This will be a slow burn, but once institutional investors understand that this is in fact a tech company it will be a good long term play.   
\-I have taken a share only position and intend to hold, with a partial sell off/profit take strategy around $50 per share.
* **PSTH -**  Bill Ackman's baby. A SPAC curated with the intention of taking a private ""Unicorn"" public. I won't even begin to speculate on which companies they are courting as it is truly a source of contention between shareholders but names like Bloomberg, Stripe, and Menards have been dropped. The floor on this SPAC is set at a $20 buy back should the company pick a company that is not agreeable to shareholders.  
\-I'm extremely heavy in shares, and it currently makes up 30% of my portfolio. I would hold off on options as it could still be another year before a deal is announced, but you could always take a position in long dated LEAPS. 

**Tread with Caution:**

* **SBE -** I love ChargePoint. They are positioning themselves to be the Electric Charging Station infrastructure for a growing EV world. Their TAM is huge, and will grow tenfold in the next few years. I have no doubt this will be a great stock to own. The only problem is given their recent run up, I'm not sure how much more they will move once the merger takes place. If you sold HYLN after the merger you did great. If you didn't, well, you're now potentially a long term bag holder. Similar may be true about SBE, but given that their main competitor BLNK has only a small comparative penetration of the market they have a very impressive moat for growth.  
\-I've taken a large share position, however I will begin to sell off as begins to kiss $50 or shortly after the merger.  


Anyways, the point of this post was to offer encouragement and alternatives to anyone who may be unsure of what moves to make in a world dominated by NIO and PLTR meme stock hype. SPACs are by no means a sure thing, but 2020 has proven to be good to them and I will continue taking advantage of the ones where I am buying in to companies I believe in long term (even if I am only a short term position holder).

1304,Statistical analysis of the SPY/SPX credit put spread strategy,,113,jopm0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jopm0a/statistical_analysis_of_the_spyspx_credit_put/,1604605660.0,"I liked the idea of following a consistent pattern as explained by u/MagesticDorito in https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jm2tgy/my_spx_weekly_premium_selling_that_dominates_the/. I decided to write some R code that would simulate this trading strategy. My code isn't doing backtesting, but I believe it accurately represents the strategy's expected performance. It relies on the assumption that the market follows statistical patterns and we can't predict directional movement.

I used data from SPY because I'm poor and can't afford SPX options. I use a sample trade where SPY is trading at 345, and the 330 put is sold and the 315 put is purchased. A standard deviation of 10 is estimated, though this could vary depending on SPY's IV in any given week. I estimated that $40 premium would be received. The maximum loss would be $1,460. I didn't include commissions.

Here is the code:

    # Sample underlying & strike positions
    underlying_start = 345
    short_strike = 330
    long_strike = 315
    standard_deviation = 10 # Estimate for 2 DTE SPY options
    premium = 40 # Estimate for average premium received
    spread = short_strike - long_strike
    max_loss = spread - premium
    
    # Calculates the profit for a single trade
    get_profit <- function() {
      close <- rnorm(1, mean=underlying_start, sd=standard_deviation)
      profit = premium # assume a gain
      if (close<=short_strike & close > long_strike) {
        profit = premium - 100*(short_strike - close)
      } else if (close <= long_strike) {
        profit = -1 * max_loss
      }
      return(profit)
    }
    
    # Simulate a Year of Profits (52 weeks * 3x per week)
    set.seed(2020)
    sim <- replicate(156,get_profit())
    hist(sim)
    sum(sim)                     # $534 profit after a year
    losers = sim[sim < 0]
    length(losers)               # 12 losers
    1-length(losers)/length(sim) #92% win rate
    mean(losers)                 # Average $-430 loss
    mean(losers)/max_loss        # Average 17% of maximum loss
    
    # Run 10,000 years of yearly simulations
    years = replicate(10000, sum(replicate(156,get_profit())))
    hist(years)
    min(years)  # -$5,300 worst yearly loss
    max(years)  #  $6,200 best yearly gain
    mean(years) #  $2,037 average yearly gain

**Takeaways**

In a sample year, the strategy produced $534 profit. But, there are large deviations from year to year. I simulated 10,000 years of running the strategy. Overall, it makes money. However, there can be some terrible years.

See the histogram here: https://i.imgur.com/fVbSNkS.png

On average, the strategy would make around $2,000 per year while risking $1460 per trade. But, in unluckiest year, the strategy lost $5,300. In the best year of my simulation, the strategy made $6,200.

So, does this strategy work? Overall, yes, fairly well. But, there could be some very painful months or even years. I could easily see somebody giving up after a few bad months. As u/MagesticDorito emphasized, it would be important to stay calm and stick with the strategy for the long term even when hitting some bad losses.

**BIG EDIT**

I really appreciate the feedback for the model. This was my first attempt at this kind of simulation in R. Based on feedback I updated code:

* I used historical SPY data. I downloaded data from Yahoo and looked at the % changes M->W, W->F, and F->M. I randomly pull from these values when calculating the expected move in SPY.
* I lowered the premium received from 40 to 25.
* I changed the strike prices.
* Refactored a bit.
* Download the data for ""mwf_spy_data.txt"" here: https://pastebin.com/4rASffJv

New code:

    # Historical SPY close data
    # Each value represents the change in close price 2 days later
    # Only values for M->W, W->F, and F->M are included.

    df = read.csv(""mwf_spy_data.txt"")

Which is to say, if you are the seller of these puts, you would only lose money if SPY goes to $165.25 ($180 - $14.75) assuming you are selling cash-secured puts. This puts the S&P 500 back to July 2013 levels...

So, is the market pricing in such an apocalyptic scenario where stocks will fall another 30% before the end of the year--so that the bear market would, in this case, equate to a 50%+ crash, on par with the 2008 crisis?",options

As the title states, what would you recommend as the best income strategy for 100k? So far, I've thought about keeping $50000 in a savings account and positioning $50000 across 5 different stocks, selling 1 week CSPs 5% OTM.

1312,TitanFlow: Native iOS Options Flow App Free Beta,,115,jxaiiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jxaiiq/titanflow_native_ios_options_flow_app_free_beta/,1605817571.0,"**TL;DR** 

My team and I have been working on building a mobile options flow app for the past few months and we’re finally ready to open up the beta to anyone interested. We have followed the latest design principles with fast filtering options. Visit [https://titanflow.io](https://titanflow.io/) to sign up for the beta.

# About Options Flow

Options flow is a stream of option trades deemed unique by an algorithm. It gives you an indication where institutions (hedge funds, market makers etc.) are putting their money. They may know something you don't know about the market and our app is one way to stay informed.

Flow is an essential tool while trading options (and stocks), but you SHOULD NOT solely rely on flow for trade entry and exits. Rather it’s best combined with technical analysis and other trading strategies to reassure trade decisions. It’s also a great place to start looking for trade opportunities which should then be confirmed using other methods.

# About the App

It is currently only available on iOS (Android coming soon). We have a whole range of features in the app that summarizes all the data into an easy to use and digestible way. This coupled with a user friendly interface, you’re bound to get lost for hours searching through all the flow data.  Here’s a list of our core features:

Snapshot:

* A high level overview of where the most money is flowing into all stocks and ETFs.

Flow:

* Easily surf, filter, and search through options flow that updates instantaneously throughout the day. 

Contracts:

* Custom-built algorithm identifies trending contracts within the flow that meet specific parameters. Trending contracts are split into Levels for clarity and efficiency.

Alerts:

* First ever custom flow alerts with push notifications right to your device. Select your unique parameters or levels for individual or rapid flow detection.

Historical Search

* Flash back in time to see the flow on any trading day.  This is a great way to backtest your strategies.

# Education

We understand that a lot of people don’t know how to use flow. Alongside launching the app, we will be creating educational material to help you implement flow in your current trading strategy, thereby improving your overall options game.

# Community

We aim to build a discord community around options flow. We regularly post flow and tutorials on how to use our platform.  It’s a great space for people to ask questions and learn more.

# Security & Privacy

We don’t collect any information from you except what is required by OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority). We understand that users care about their privacy in 2020 so we have taken a privacy first approach at building this app. 

# Cost

The app is currently in beta and is completely free to try out. We have not finalized our pricing as of this post. However, we will say it will be considerably more reasonable than other flow providers.

# Website

Visit [https://titanflow.io](https://titanflow.io/) for beta signup and free access to our free discord.

# Final Comments

We want to thank the mods of this subreddit for allowing us to post about our app. If you have any questions feel free to AMA and we’ll do the best we can to get back to everyone. We want to get as much feedback as possible so we can provide the best app possible.

* **If you take losses in December, don't buy back the same stock (or option) for 31 days.**  
If you take losses in any stock in December, be sure NOT to repurchase the same stock (or an option on that stock) for a period of 31 days. If you do, your losses will be deferred to a later tax year. You won't permanently lose the loss, it will just move forward and you will have a greater tax consequence in the current year.   **Note that options with different expiration dates on the same ticker are often treated as the same from your broker even though they are different positions.** 
* **Close out any open positions at year end that have accumulated wash sale losses.**  
If you have any open positions at year end that have wash sale losses attached to them, these wash losses must be deferred to a later tax year. To avoid this unpleasant situation, close the open position that has a large wash sale loss attached to it and do not trade this stock again for 31 days.
* **Avoid trading the same security in your taxable and non-taxable IRA accounts.**  
Because of the severe nature of IRA wash sale adjustments, it is often best to avoid any situation where an IRA wash sale could be triggered. Which means not trading the same security (or options on that security) in both your accounts. If you must trade the same security, be especially alert to losses that occur in your taxable account and avoid any new opening trades for 30 days in the IRA.

**GPS – Gap Inc**

Gap has been on a huge run recently, this week saw some pretty bullish activity in CALL flow coming through. Looks like many blocks of calls between 2k-10k contracts with October to December expiration expects the stock to continue on it’s run. Kanye has recently signed a clothing deal with Gap which has brought life back to the stock.

**ESTC – Elastic Inc**

ESTC saw an increase in option activity this week after reporting earnings. The stock has had a 20% rise in the last 3 weeks. Looks like some of the flow could be some protection buying, locking in profits, as well as some bullish flow with the $125 strike expecting the stock to continue it’s run. The stock is currently trading at $110. The flow was tough to read, but interesting to take note of with an uptick in volume here.

**AMBA – Ambarella Inc**

Somewhat of a low-key ticker getting some attention recently is AMBA (Ambarella). Pretty one-sided call flow coming through sweeping a range of strikes out the money. Most in a pretty short-term time frame (September 18). Looks like AMBA is set to report earnings this week and these look to be an earnings play.

**IQ – iQIYI Inc.**

I’ve heard IQ is like the Netflix/Youtube combination in China, not exactly sure. Looks like the September expiration had some solid flow roll through skewed to the bullish side. There was also bullish activity happening two weeks ago, the stock consolidated in a tight range for those 2 weeks and just shot up over 10% this week. Looks like most of this recent bullish flow came through AFTER the stock shot up and they are trying to build a momentum position.

**SHAK – Shake Shack Inc.**

Some bearish activity in Shake Shack last week. The stock is close to it’s pre-covid high, but still down about 40% from ATH back in the end of 2019. Some bearish activity rolled through this week, with a heavy put-buying in October 16 PUT contracts. 2,700 contracts were opened for a $1.6m position. I don’t typically like to follow bearish activity because stonks usually go up, but thought this was noteworthy. Earnings aren’t until November, so this could be potentially a second wave/shutdown play as we get into the fall months.

**DIS – Walt Disney Company**

DIS saw some OTM call sweeps being bought up last week. Here’s the intraday sentiment outlook as the daily doesn’t do it justice. Most of these calls were bought OTM with a few being pretty far OTM. In my opinion DIS will struggle with revenues in our post-covid world, but I’ve learned from experience to not FK with the mouse. Most of these plays were 3-9 months out with April 2021 expiration. This is more of a long-term timeframe expecting the stock to break through pre-covid all-time-highs.

Basically, I want to know if there are some options-related observations that you might've noticed while trading. It could be something common sense like ""Buying deep OTM contracts with short expiry never goes well"" or something more specific related to option greeks, strategies, hedging, etc. 

Here are some of mine, most are common sense and in no particular order: 

- Earnings plays: These, in my experience, almost never work due to the volatility drop right after earnings. I learned this lesson playing $EBAY's earnings and barely broke even despite being right and anticipating a huge drop. I bought the contracts one day before earnings at the peak of their volatility as well. I'm sure sure you can profit by playing earnings if you buy the contracts early enough but I personally don't see the point of playing earnings when there are lots of other opportunities to enter with favorable conditions . I filter out stocks with earnings less than 2 weeks with my scanner. 

- Volatility: Having a healthy understanding of volatility is crucial whether you're an option buyer or seller. For option buyers, low volatility is ideal and high volatility contracts tend to be dangerous buys. Conversely, option sellers benefit with high volatility and suffer in low volatility conditions. Having bought high volatility contracts on meme stocks, it was frustrating to see their value plummet when they didn't make massive moves. I personally filter out option contracts with volatility over 75%. 

- Stock movement and time: Be realistic with your expectations of when and how much an underlying will move. I personally made dozens of trades which correctly predicted a trend or direction but they fell short of profitability because I either didn't buy contracts far out enough or wrongly anticipated the timing of a trend forming. I personally use the Probability Analysis chart on TOS to get an idea of where a stock could potentially be in the desired time frame. It's basically a standard deviation so other indicators like the Bollinger Bands can achieve a similar result (though I personally don't use it). Once you establish a range of where a stock could potentially go, buying should be strictly be in that range. For option sellers, selling contracts outside of that range would be ideal. 

- Understanding how to analyze and predict stock movements: This doesn't directly relate to options but having a foundational understanding of how to analyze stocks will help you time your entries and exits for option contracts . I personally use a mix of technical and statistical analysis as I use Support/Resistance, EMA20, and Standard Deviation. Some of you might have your opinions about technical analysis but it works for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Though I'm still a novice at all this, I've found that simply experimenting with the various tools out there will give you an idea of what works and what doesn't. Having experimented with just about everything, I found that an uncluttered chart with a single moving average and some key lines is sufficient for me. 

That's about the big takeaways I've learned thus far. I'd love to hear yours.",options

Or maybe you'll wonder why you spent 3 minutes reading this.  Risk/reward, yo.

I'm trading 5k on TastyWorks.  I'm a newcomer to theta positive strategies and have done about two thirds of my overall trades in this style.  However, most of my experience in trading in the past has been intraday timeframe oriented chart reading and momentum stuff.  I learned almost everything ""new"" that I'm doing from TastyTrade, /r/options, /r/thetagang, and Option Alpha.  I've enjoyed the material coming from /u/esinvests YouTube channel quite a bit as well.  The theta gang type strategies I've done have been almost entirely around binary event IV contraction (mostly earnings, but not always) and in most cases, capped to about $250 in risk per position.  

The raw numbers:

**Net PnL : +247**

**Commissions paid: -155**

**Fees: -42**

Right away what jumps out is something that was indicated by /u/realdeal43 and /u/PapaCharlie9 in my previous thread.  This is a tough, grindy way to trade a small account.  It reminds me a little bit of when I was rising through the stakes in online poker, playing $2/4 limit holdem.  Even if you're a profitable player in that game, beating the rake over the long term is very, very hard.  Here, over 3 months of trading a conservative style with mostly defined risk strategies, my commissions are roughly equal to my net PnL.  That is just insane, and I don't even think I've been overtrading.

55 trades total, win rate of 60%

* 33 purely directional trades - 57.5% win 
* 18 long call or long put positions, **+692**, 55% win 
* 15 call or put verticals, **-121**, 60% win 

22 neutral / other trades

* 13 iron condors, **+345**, 77% win rate
* 7 strangles, **-163**, 71% win rate
* 1 straddle, **-310**, 0% win rate
* 1 butterfly, **-83**, 0% win rate

Biggest wins:

* PTON call purchased and held through earnings, sold the morning of announcement **+410**
* Trading the range on the daily chart in GLD from 158 up to 165, a mix of various calls **+245**
* NKLA 30 put purchased before the close on the day it went north of 100, just a pure fade **+215**

Biggest losses:

* EWZ 22/26 strangle that I held just way too long as it beat me up day after day from May 20-Jun 3, **-316**
* ZM pre earnings vertical, fading another 2 SD move (the day it hit 200 for the first time).  Was expecting a post-earnings selloff given the magnitude of the up move.  Stock basically hasn't had a down tick since.  Max loss **-247**
* EWW 29 straddle, put on around the same time as the EWZ strangle.  Rolled from Jun to Jul to no avail.  Out at a **-310** loss.

This is pretty much where I expected to be while learning a bunch of new trading techniques.  And no, this is not a large sample size so I have no idea whether or not I can be profitable trading this way (yet).  I am heartened by the fact that I seem to be hitting my earnings trades and selling quick spikes in IV (like weed cures Corona day).  I'm disheartened that I've went against my principles several times, holding trades for longer than I originally intended, or letting losses mount, believing that I could roll or manage my way out of trouble.

I still feel like I am going against my nature to some degree.  My trading in years past was scalping oriented and simple.  I was taught that a good trade was right almost immediately.  If it went against me, I'd cut it immediately and look for a better entry.  This is absolutely nothing like that.  A good trade may take weeks to develop.  It's been really hard for me to sit through the troughs and it's been even harder to watch an okay profit get taken out by a big swing in delta.  Part of me wonders if I am cut out for this style at all and if I shouldn't just take my 5k and start trading micro futures.  But that's a different post...

I'll share a couple of my meager learnings:

&#x200B;

* Larger bid/ask spreads make it almost impossible to trade the higher priced names, even if you have a correct assumption.  I have traded some bigger underlyings during this time like LULU and NVDA.  They are just tough fills, both getting in and getting out.  I almost want to say that you shouldn't even bother trading underlyings bigger than a 10 cent bid/ask spread with a small account.  
* Get an idea of the timeframe you're interested in holding before putting anything on.  Have a plan for entering and exiting everything that goes beyond ""I'll take this trade off at 50%"".  You can use TA, you can use a news catalyst, a binary event, just have something.  Countless sources out there talk about trading a plan.  It doesn't have to be the perfect plan, it just has to be ""a"" plan.  
* Undefined risk trades in tiny accounts need hard stops.  Yes, some of the studies say that you'll do better without having fixed stop loss rules (50% of max loss, 100% of max loss) -- but what the studies don't say is the effect that it will have on you, mentally.  I got pretty bent out of shape over how badly EWZ and EWW went against me -- much more than I expected.  It made no sense, as I've lost way more on the turn of a card in .5 seconds and been unfazed.  I was unprepared for the mental toll that it took waking up day after day, watching positions move further and further against me.  Great time to be short calls during the mother of all rallies.  
* My initial plan for undefined risk trades in my account was that I would only do them in ETFs.  Logic being that I'm just not going to wake up to an accounting scandal or a buyout and take a $1k loss on the chin.  I later expanded my range into lower priced underlyings like BBBY, TLRY, and yes, AAL.  But these ETFs can and do move (I learned the hard way) and can soak up a surprising amount of BP.  It might be better to have 5 iron condors taking up $1000 of BP @ 200 each instead of 2 strangles @ 500 each.  

&#x200B;

My new questions :

&#x200B;

* My big wins felt like I simply leaned on my TA background or got lucky.  My big losses, I sure felt like I earned those, through mistakes I've definitely since identified.  The stuff in the middle, I'm just not sure.  I'm up money, but it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels.  My win rate is good, but I still struggle with expectations about how quickly a trade should progress.  What is the next step of the process for a newer options trader?  I've read some stuff on narrower spreads + more contracts vs. wider spreads and fewer contracts.  Is there a number where I should just keep doing what I'm doing until I reach a specific # of occurrences?  Should I even think about branching out into different strategies yet (ratio spreads, jade lizards, etc) or continue to work on these basics?
* I still feel like I am super weak in delta management.  In some cases I feel like I've taken a loss simply because I didn't know what the proper management techniques were.  I understand the concept of rolling out in time for a credit, but I just don't think it's in my nature to hold trades for longer than a month, and even that is hard for me.  At what delta is it appropriate to start thinking about hedging?
* Every time I put on a credit spread for a 2-3 day move and am directionally correct, I often wish that I had just bought a naked option.  I've caught several big moves this way in things like AAPL; most recently I bought the FB dip to the 50 day MA around 215 and took it off today at 225 (which was always my plan) -- it leads me to wonder if my expectations for credit spreads are completely out of line.  I can't lie, it feels bad to catch a 10 point move and only make $40, haha.  What is the ideal timeframe for a credit spread to be left on?  Is it better to just buy premium with a stop loss and have a more profitable risk/reward equation for situations like the above where the only intent is to hold for a couple days?
* Here's a random question -- other than when the BPR hit is too much (ie names over $50) for undefined risk, would you rather hold 1) a strangle for 10-14 days or 2) an iron condor for 25-30 days?   So far my criteria for IC vs strangle has largely been driven by the risk profile and BPR and not so much profit potential in X number of days.   If you're collecting the standard 1/3rd on the IC and taking the trade off at 50% (if you're lucky) , it seems like it takes about a month to get there, most of the time.

That's enough of this wall of text for now.  If you made it this far, I salute you, because this shit was even longer than my last post.",options
1336,Expect major volatility changes this week.,,110,enrbrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/enrbrh/expect_major_volatility_changes_this_week/,1578854337.0,"I saw another post asking about anticipating Fed actions, and thought it would be good to share some potentially obscure information. The repo market drama was predicted by a fellow named Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse in August 2019. You can find his report if you want, but this article is easier to digest: 

https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/08/22/1566491938000/There-s-a-black-hole-in-the-dollar-funding-market/

If the global financial system’s problem is a shortage of US dollars, it makes sense for foreign central banks to pull funds away from their local bill markets to help improve the reinvestment returns of dollar lenders and hence ease the flow of dollars, but it makes no sense for the Fed to do the same – if it does, it hurts the flow of dollars. Here is how… If the Fed offers a rate above Treasury bill yields on an uncapped the foreign RRP facility, it will attract inflows. Inflows sterilize reserves and increase collateral supply on the margin – instead of buying Treasury bills at auctions, the facility incentivises foreign central banks to deposit cash at the Fed. These dynamics put an upward pressure on local bill yields, and higher local bill yields reduce the allure of lending dollars in the FX swap market – the flow of dollars suffers and the Fed is pushing against the efforts of other central banks.

So, unless the Fed takes action -- and by that Pozsar doesn’t mean technical action such as the creation of a standing repo facility or asset purchases -- the collateral tsunami may continue to worsen.

It follows, Pozsar says, that if the Fed priced supply out of the market, it should now consider rate cuts instead: ”...rate cuts that are aggressive enough to re-steepen the curve so that dealer inventories can clear; cuts deep enough to incentivise real-money investors to lend long, not short and foreign investors to buy Treasuries on an FX hedged basis on scale again.”

1342,[Guide] Hedged Straddles and Strangles in a 3:2 Ratio.,,111,grnuxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/grnuxp/guide_hedged_straddles_and_strangles_in_a_32_ratio/,1590599736.0,"This is a strategy that has limited risk, and decent profit potential considering the length of holding the position (generally 2-3 days).

The layout is a long strangle/straddle expiring the next week and a short strangle expiring in the current week at a 3:2 ratio. For example, here is an MSFT trade I just entered.

MSFT Price at Entry: 178.90

Buy 3 177.5 P (6/5 Exp)

Buy 3 180 C (6/5)

Sell 2 175 P (5/29)

Sell 2 182.5 C (5/29)

Price of 3 Long Strangles: 2.65 + 2.99 X 3 = 16.92

Price of 2 Short Strangles: .51 + .58 X 2 = 2.18

Entry Price: **1474$**

The short credit covers 218$ of theta decay in the long strangle if the stock doesn't move, or around 13%. In cases where the stock price doesn't move, the play can still be a winner and is usually a small loser (~3-5%) unless there is also an accompanying volatility drop which can make it a medium loser (10-15% generally).

Because longs are in a higher number to shorts, there is still unlimited profit potential to the upside or downside.

Run this through a profit loss calculator or an analysis tool and see if you like what you see. This has become one of my go-to plays.

**A few rules:**

**Don't make this play around earnings.** When earnings come into play, IV becomes inverted (back week has higher IV than front week) so moves in the stock price affect the short strangle more than the long strangle/straddle, which can make the play a big loser. If you want to run a hedged straddle/strangle around earnings, the long must be in at least a 5:2 ratio to the short, sometimes up to 4:1.

Generally don't open on days when there has been a big spike in VIX, as this increases the entry price of the position and leaves you vulnerable to volatility drops.

You can use a 2:1 ratio if you want more upside for a stock price move, but this leaves you more vulnerable if the stock price doesn't move.

You can also use a 1:1 ratio provided you can find a setup where the wing widths are wide enough and you can still get a required amount of short credit. However, the rules for 1:1 ratios are a bit more complex. I will make another post in a few days detailing the rules for this.

This strategy performs well when VIX is elevated (25+). I have not used this strategy in regular market conditions, but I think it would still work, although short credits would be smaller. The ratio may need tinkering in normal market conditions.

Gain Target: ~10%. These plays can easily produce 20-30% gains as well; however, when you are in this gain range the play becomes more directional so you need to be weary of price reversals.

Entry date: I usually look to enter on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.  Length of hold can be longer but make sure you get a higher percentage of short credit as there will be more theta decay in your long.

Exit date: Anytime between Thursday EOD and Midday Friday.

**Always buy back short puts and calls if they go to 0.05 or under.**

Try to use highly liquid stocks (AMD, INTC, MSFT) that also move a decent bit.

That's all I can think of for now. Lmk if there are any questions.

1343,Selling Deep in the Money Covered Calls,,109,grhdq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/grhdq3/selling_deep_in_the_money_covered_calls/,1590576018.0,"Hello All,

I've been exploring options trading and have found a strategy I like from the options screener and CFRA on TD Ameritrade.

The trade is essentially selling deep in the money calls to create a net debit less than the strike price of the call. e.g.

F trades for 5, you buy 100 shares and sell an option at a strike price of 3 for 2.50

Therefore as long as F doesn't decline below 3 you profit .50 per share or 50 dollars.

The trade seems conservative and bearish in that you are creating a lot of downside protection from writing the call.

Has anybody had experience with this strategy. Any thoughts on whether it could consistently win at the 20 to 25 % annualized return listed on TD Ameritrade screener and analyzed by the CFRA.

Thanks in advance for any response.

Ok, I've traded options since the early 1980s (with lots of hiatuses--hiatii?).

The last couple of years I've been mostly successful selling cash secured puts and covered calls.

Last year, a stock I have long traded got acquired and the deal was for $23.50 in cash. The stock flatlined around $23.15-$23.30ish for a few months. They got approval from CFIUS (the buyer was foreign and the companies are defense contractors).

Then, the FTC asked for a second round of information right after Thanksgiving. Boom. I realized the deal was going to create a complete monopoly in a small defense product line and figured ""Hey, this deal is going to get rejected.""

So, I shorted 300 shares and looked at the option chains. They are mostly totally illiquid, like zero bid offered at $4.80.

Right before New Year's, knowing a deal deadline was coming but the FTC wouldn't be ready, I saw that there were two March 20 puts offered for 5 cents each. Now, I figured the stock would go to $15 if the deal fell through. So I put in an order for 10 and got executed on 2. The next day, same thing, two more. The day after, I was able to buy 4, for a total of 8.

A few weeks went by until the end of January approached. Still no news. Then I noticed that JUNE 20 puts were for sale for 5 cents. I ended up buying 55 of them for 5 cents.

LSS, on March 5, they announced the deal was off and the stock fell to the low 17 area. The options were totally illiquid and untradeable, so I bought the full 6,300 shares at an average cost of $17.25 and exercised ecerything.

A couple of days later my group at work (about 15 people) had a pizza and salad free lunch courtesy of one contract.

With investing, there is a direct correlation between risk and reward. If we want to increase our reward, we increase our risk whether you realize it or not. Most of the accounts I see on this thread fall below $100k (based on a survey I did a month or so ago) with the majority under $25k. 

Trading in a smaller account is a completely legitimate endeavor and helps refine a lifelong skill set. The danger comes in when one expects to take that $15K account and turn it into $100k, $50K or even $25K. When I first started, I had $5K and was expecting to turn it into $20K in a couple years and naively thought that was completely reasonable. Luckily, I had a couple hard conversations, of which I didn’t believe at first, that ultimately reshaped my perception of reality. 

Having aspirations is great. Creating targets and goals is important. Attempting to turn a small account into your source of wealth is not so great. More likely than not, it will include taking outsized risk that will sooner or later catch you. 

The best possible way to aggressively grow your account (IMO) is to continue trading, being sure to remain profitable - when smaller accounts lose money it can have exponential negative effects years ahead. Learn to earn a consistent return, ideally topping SP500 performance (if you don’t after 4-5 years, consider switching to buy and hold or move a sizable portion). SAVE your money. Continue developing additional streams of income. 

This grind in your early 20s can pay off as early as your late 20s. I was blown away when I realized I surpassed my goal to cover all living expenses with my investing account at late 27. Much was luck in making the right moves in other ventures at the right time. The point remains. If you can aggressively save your money to boost your account value, then achieve consistent market beating returns, spread into other ventures (real estate, business development, etc) you will be surprised how fast wealth begins to accumulate. 

None of this eludes in any capacity that this is easy. I spent the better part of a decade planning, committing, and refining this. However, if we apply ourselves and develop a plan, we can greatly increase our propensity for success. I come from a lower middle class single mother that was a over her head in debt. My graduating class had over 800 kids in a poor urban town. By all accounts I am average. That’s the beauty of investing, we don’t need to to be extraordinary to get started. We do need to develop the craft to become a statistical outlier - but it’s entirely possible.",options

Expected moves range from just 3% in JNJ to 7% in WFC and 8% in NFLX.

This is an interesting week considering the last go around on earnings for most of these stocks were in the midst of the Covid sell-off, where most expected moves were off the charts but earnings themselves were not the catalyst, it was overall market volatility. This time around, expectations for more specific details on how each company has fared during the past 3 months means the events themselves will be more important. But these earnings announcements are happening in a sub 30 VIX environment and markets near all time highs. A lot has changed.

Buying calls and puts has the risk of losing your invested money, but when you do some research and take position in options that feel positive in delivering profit that risk declines.

FB has been trending in an upward channel divided by a top and bottom half. On Monday last week it has broken through the middle into the bottom half, tested the 55 EMA (green line) and passed the test, meaning it held the level. $270.50 will be the key level to watch this week.

If it can hold $270.50 it has room to test $280, if that is claimed, then room to the middle of the channel at $285.30. If that level can be claimed, then room to $292.50

If it cannot hold the $276.50 level, then room to test last days' lows around $274. If that level is broken to the downside, then it has room to test the 55 EMA (green line) at $269.50. It is also the bottom of the channel, so will be a very strong level to test. If it breaks that with conviction to the downside then room down to $259 and lower.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral/Bullish
Options: If it holds $276.50 then looking at NOV 27 $290 Calls: If it cannot hold looking at Nov 27 $265 Puts.

AMZN

AMZN has been one of those stocks impacted positively by the pandemic. It has been performing very well in the last months. Nevertheless it has been in consolidation mode recently trading between $2870 and $3550. At th moment the stock has been rejected by the 55 EMA (green line) to the downside, and is now slowly retracing back up to test it. The key level to watch for this week will be $3110.

If it can hold $3110, then it has room to the 55 EMA (green line) at $3160. If it can reclaim that level then room to test $3225. If it can claim that level, then room to $3289.

If it cannot hold $3110 then room down to test $3080. If that level cannot hold, then room down to $3020, and if that doesn't hold, then room to test ercent lows at $2951.70. Next level after that is a strong support at $2871.

Overall Sentiment: Netural/Bullish
Options: If it can hold $3110, then looking at NOV 27 $3200 Calls: If it cannot hold the NOV 27 $3110 then looking at $3050 Puts

AAPL

Apple is the most popular stock out there. After an incredible run it has been consolidating between the $100 and $135 range, getting tighter and tighter as the weeks pass since it hit All Time Highs early September. It is currently, trying to reclaim and trade on levels above the 118 support. $118 and $115 will be key level to watch this week.

If it can hold the $118 level with conviction, room to $121.50, and if it holds that it can test $125 which is recent highs.

If it cannot hold $118 then it will go down to $115 and test the 55 EMA (green line). If it cannot hold that then room to $112.25.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral
Options: If it can hold $118 looking at the Nov 20 $125 Calls: If it cannot hold $118 looking at $115 Puts, if it starts to fall hard then roll into $110 (lots of volume and cheap)

My experience:
I sold 25 call credit spreads, that went in the money. The short leg will be settled today (friday). I exercised the long leg immediately, when I noticed yesterday. But it will not be settled until monday. This will leave me with a short position over the weekend. Comes monday, I will be looking at a loss of over $13,500. That is on a $4k account...

His daily market analysis ended up being 80% wrong at predicting the S&P. The 20% he is right, he uploads the video after market on YouTube bragging about how he's always right. 

TradingOptionsLive is probably the worst investment I ever made. I was desperate and thought he was the real deal, fake name with no last name should've been a red flag. Not only that, but he only shows his analysis if he was right. He's been spouting how its a great time to get Puts while the stock market climbs day by day. And when it does drop one time out of the week he brags about how he called it and should be praised. 

Another thing you will notice are fake youtube comments that are upvoted, accounts subscribed to no one. Deleting any truthful hurting comments as well as shadowbanning them from publicly commenting. I have 2 youtube accounts to confirm.

I went in believing he does analysis as well as trades ""Live"", hence the word ""live"" in his website & username! Instead each are recorded and he then decides weather to upload or not. Illegal false advertising imo... and I would probably sue him if I had the money cause I hate him that much.

This is a friendly warning to redditors to never try his service. As Leo is a ruthless business man who does not give a shit about you, he will not give refunds. Sales are final.

### How to ask Smart Questions and get Smart Answers

If you're not sure about any of the below,   
post to the weekly Options Questions Safe Haven Thread,  
for new traders. Your post most probably belongs there. 

**A few tips to avoid shitposts on the main thread   
(shitposts will be taken down):** 

- Have a meaningful title describing the topic. ""Help"" is not meaningful. 
- State the underlying ticker, strategy, strikes, expiration, price on entry     
- What was your original plan? Did something go wrong and you are looking for help? Be specific.

- If you are exploring an idea, stay on the side of being more verbose than terse. If it takes 12 responses to weed out all the details, it's a shitpost (and you know what happens next).

- Want to start a thread about something else just to chat? Fine, just make sure you don't sound like /wallstreetbets  is paying a visit.

- Not sure about any of the above? Just post. The worst that will happen is it will be taken down, there's no public shaming. Send the ModMail, it works.

- Don't link to external sites with paid services. It's ok to mention relevant content in a context of a discussion, but link posts with no commentary are spam, and will be taken down promptly.

- Finally, for multi-leg positions stick to a commonly accepted form, like:
  - 200/210 short call spread (or credit call spread)  
  - 195/200/240/245 long iron condor  
  - 205 long call

*I just made (or lost) $____. Should I close the trade?*       
Yes, close the trade, because you had no plan for an exit to limit your risk.    
Your trade is a prediction: a plan directs action upon an (in)validated prediction.       
Take the gain (or loss). End the risk of losing the gain (or increasing the loss).        
Plan the exit before the start of each trade, for both a gain, and maximum loss.

1401,Bubble protection,,100,ktbbup,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ktbbup/bubble_protection/,1610138652.0,"Hi everyone, by now I'm sure most of you think we're in a bubble. The only question is when, not if, it pops. The purpose of this thread is not to try and time it, but to figure out the best possible hedge that covers as many scenarios as possible. I'll be writing a few scenarios on how these next 1-2 years might go and the best hedge is of course the hedge which will print the most in as many scenarios as possible.

Looking back at the '00 bubble, the pop started towards the end of March and stocks suffered a 20-30% correction in just 2 months. Then they started trading sideways for a few more months until September of the same year and from there on and the bubble completely burst and went down straight to hell, finally reaching a bottom some time in 2001 and 2002. Many stocks lost 70-90% of value and I'm talking big ones like CSCO. SPY itself lost almost 50%. Freaking SPY man, which is not composed of only tech stocks. Some stocks, like CSCO, reached a bottom in april of 2001 and then traded sideways, while others took a little longer. If you look at SPY, it only bottomed out in the summer/fall of 2002. This is what happened in the 2000s. Doesn't mean it will happen exactly the same way, but let's say this is our first potential scenario and that it plays out the same way.

&#x200B;

The following scenarios may play out over 01/2021 to 01/2023.

**First scenario**

Mimicking the dot com bubble, the market has a correction, then stagnation and then a long bear market that lasts a year or more.

**Second scenario**

The bubble continues to grow, with or without corrections. This is an important one, because this is just as likely, if not more, than the other scenarios. The best hedge should print in this scenario as well. This is why you can't just simply buy some tesla leap puts because, unless tesla pops some time in the next few months, those leap puts you bought won't be worth much. Try out the options profit calculator to see.

**Third scenario**

Flash crash, followed by stagnation. Imagine the market losing 50%+ or more in the course of 3 months before finding a bottom any time in the next 2 years. The closer to our date it happens, the more your puts will print. But if it happens towards the end of 2022, yours puts will probably be near worthless by then. So the hedge has to answer this scenario as well.

**Bonus scenario**

We're straight flat for 2 years. Only play here is theta gang.

&#x200B;

Now there are a bunch of ways to hedge in a bull market. So let's proceed by elimination. ^(Note that this all assumes that our calls and shares were bought or puts were written at or near the top of the bubble. If you still got shares that you brought months or years ago, you'll have a much easier time to get out.)

Shorting: As a retailer, you'd have to have a death wish to short stocks in this market. I think it's obvious why, so this one's out.

Cash: Keeping a large amount of cash in your portfolio, 30-50% is not a bad idea on the surface. However consider this. If you look at the CSCO chart in the 2000s, it fell from 80$ to 55$ from March to May. Even assuming you use your cash to 'buy the dip' at the very bottom in April, CSCO never reached the same evaluation it had in March. From here you have 2 possibilities. You've kept your shares that you brought at the top and you averaged down at the bottom. You now exit at no loss or profit on the rebound. Or, you wait and hope the bubble goes back up. It never does and your portfolio is gone. So realistically the only way you'll get out of this bubble is by losing anywhere between 0 and 100% of your portfolio depending on skill, luck and patience.

VXX calls: Not bad, but will fail the second scenario.

Short term puts: This hedge is the most profitable one if we're going to be in the third scenario. But the third scenario has such a low probability of occurring due to what happened in March last year. Plus you have to time it and in this thread we're assuming we can't do that. Another thing you can do is buy short term puts every few weeks on overvalued stocks until the bubble pops. Then again, you'll lose a ton of money in the second scenario or if the bubble pops very late from now.

Leap puts: This hedge would probably be the best one if bought in the right company.  Consider AMC from 2018 (or even 2016) to today. This stock went from 20$ to 2$ over the course of 2 years. When the covid crash came, AMC only accelerated going down. When the markets rebounded on stimuluses, this stock still kept going down. Just a few days ago it reached a new all time low. And this is no joke of a company. It's the largest movie theater chain in the world. This company's stock bled money for over 5 years. A leap put in a company like this one, that's projected to go down in all 3 scenarios, is the best hedge.

Leap puts will however not bring you a lot of money if the bubble pops late or we enter in a drawn out bear market in which case you might even lose you money. That is why, given our lack of insider knowledge and inability to time the market and the risk that shorting brings, our only realistic way to hedge in this market is to buy leap puts on a failing company. A company that will go downwards whether the bubble pops or not, or whether it pops fast or slow. A company that's not something like NKLA. Because even though I strongly believe NKLA to be a huge pile of bs, the current EV euphoria might just be enough to make your puts worthless. So companies with 'potential' shouldn't be good candidates.

&#x200B;

I guess in the end, what I'm asking you, reddit people of higher intellect, is the following:

1. How are you hedging in these conditions?
2. Do you have any ticker in mind that fits the situation that AMC went through and if so, how would you justify it?",options

I am sure many would have done or planned to do similar thing . What had been your experience and what are the lesson that I should keep in mind.

So far the hardest is sticking with the plan when I reach my +$300.

HD closes at 217.47 at expiration 8/23 and I incurred max loss.,,97,cuv0ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/cuv0ol/i_sold_2175_hd_put_and_got_215_put_as_protection/,1566661754.0,"I sold 300 of the -217.5p/+215p credit spread for HD with 8/23 expiration.  The max loss should be $2.50.  At the closing on Friday, HD closed at $217.47 so those put contract I sold was in the money by 0.03 cents.  However, my brokerage, bank of america, makes me take max loss of $2.50 each despite having a 0.03 cents ITM contract.

1. My brokerage after hours excercised all 300 of my 215 put contracts that I bought for protection and sold all the shares at $215
2. Today when I woke up, I found out that 198 contracts out of the 300 ""217.5 put"" contracts I sold were assigned.
3. My brokerage could have just waited for me to be assigned and force me to sell the shares once I get assigned, but instead choose to make me take a max loss for their own protection.
4. They also said they have a team to close any in the money contracts 1 hour before the market closes. However, my 217.50 put were not on their radar and they missed closing my contracts before market closes.

Do any of you ever had this happened?  I don't know what to do.

[Yesterday, after hours, my brokerage decided to excercise my 215 put as protection and sold all the shares](https://i.redd.it/uzk6bl934fi31.jpg)

UPDATE 1: Added the 4th point for clarification

UPDATE 2 8/26/19: So the 10,200 shares of HD which was shorted at $215, I had to rebuy at $217.57.  Everything with this trade is made against the best interest of the trader.  Had Merill Edge let my sold put be assigned at $217.50, I could have sold those shares back to the market at $218 today and come out ahead.  The intervention by the human factor lead me to more than a max loss in this case.  The picture is posted below

NOTE: The argument that my account cannot handle $6.5 million in HD shares is true.  However, the broker makes me takes a $6.5 million margin to buy 30,000 shares of HD whereas I was only assigned 19,800 shares at $217.50, which is roughly $4 million something.  So by forcing me to take $6.5 million, it is even riskier than just letting me be assigned.

[Record of trade.  They could have left my position alone.  I would have been assigned 19,800 shares of HD at $217.50 and be able to sell it back for the same price or more.

1411,My play on TGT,,94,8ojfj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8ojfj4/my_play_on_tgt/,1528135481.0,"Just wanted to share a play I made with my rationale for entering it.

I was following TGT during their earnings.  Right before the earnings, it was approaching an area of resistance - with the RSI reaching the top, with no real signs of prior weakness.  It gapped down about $4 dollars after their earnings report, missing by $0.07 - but they still posted strong numbers.  

I waited until 5/25 (3rd day post-earnings) to enter a long position with the assumption that TGT was going back up.  The technical indicators were pretty good, and the IV was low - so I felt it was an appropriate time to go long.

My position was a synthetic long static delta backspread:

- TGT was trading around $71.

- Bought 2 JUL 18 65 Calls ($7.17 x 2 - roughly $1.17 of extrinsic)

- Sold 1 JUL 18 70 Call ($3.35; $2.35 of extrinsic)

The premium collected from the short call paid for all of the premium of the long call (+$2.35 for the short and -$1.17 x 2 for the longs).  Long with a neutral theta - the only way I like it!

Today, TGT is up $5 from when I entered the position - so I closed it for a $500 win.  My target profit was around $1k ($81), but I was happy enough with today's $3 move.  Had TGT moved lower after the 4th-5th day (after earnings), I would have got out immediately - as this would have been an indicator that my initial assumption was wrong.

This trade tied up $1100 in capital, vs. the $7100 of capital it would have used to long 100 shares @$71.  

This is an example of how to use options as an alternative method for holding stock - and a much cheaper (less capital) way of doing it.

The most I could have lost was $1100, and that would have only been the case if TGT fell under $60 while I was holding.  There would have been the same amount of loss had I bought 100 shares at $71, with a drop to $60.

[https://www.pickmojo.com](https://www.pickmojo.com)

That post got me some great feedback that I was super appreciative of, and caused me to take a step back and implement some of the main feedback that I got and stopped really putting the site out there. Here is the main new features I've added:  


**Sell orders** \- This was a huge main part of the feedback, being able to pick sell orders instead of just picks based on buying options. Now you can track writes.  


**Spreads** \- Another huge request was not only doing naked options but being able to pick spreads to limit risk and have more detailed picks. Now you can pick any sort of spread by applying multiple options to the same pick, so do your Iron Condor, Box spreads, Vertical spreads, whatever!  


**Notifications -** Now if you follow another picker you can get notifications of when they make and settle picks.

**Chat -** We now have global chat rooms to discuss options, which includes showing when someone on the site has made a new pick, the chat is accessible from a button at the top.  


**More stats -** A huge part of the idea is to break down peoples stats and track records. I have added a bunch of stats, giving you the ability to break down peoples history by how confident they were on their picks, and see a graph of their ROI over time and what picks caused it to go up and down, an example of the stats page is my Jim Cramer Tracker(what if cramer traded options): [https://www.pickmojo.com/user/JimCramerTracker/stats](https://www.pickmojo.com/user/JimCramerTracker/stats)

So what does this mean?  For many brokerages, it means you can only exercise (at expiration or sooner) or close these options.  Check your broker for specifics.  Regardless, it means the liquidity of these non-standard options is about to plummet.  And as traders, we want liquidity.  Today is probably the best time to try to close because like me, many were caught off guard by this.  Once the hoard closes, it will be harder and harder to trade these.

A Normal Day?
 
Late Selloff
No Real Features
 
 
Today was as close to a normal day as any I’ve seen in the last 6 weeks.  Futures were all over the place last night and opened to the downside this morning but before 10:00 we were back on the upside banging against the 2,640 level for the fourth day in a row.  Support around 2,575 seems to be present and we rallied off it several times.  However, today’s pickup to a slight new high for the week and closing on the low of the day leads me to the conclusion that we are running out of steam.  This week’s range is a meager 95 S&P points, and the Friday close of $2,541 may be an important number.  If we go no higher and get back into last week’s range (2191 to 2637) we can head back towards the area of a necessary, test of the current bottom (and I use that term with extreme caution).  The volume continues to shrink daily, with the absence of the normal “end of quarter” rebalancing trading.  Market internals were just okay with NYSE losers with a slight edge and NASDAQ 1:1. Volume was average for an average day, as were treasury prices.  Most of the economic numbers are pre-COVID-19 and I think useless.  The DJIA was considerably weaker than the market with 25 down and only 5 up.  The only big (?) gainer was CAT on the news that the Great Orange might suspend or delay tariff charges, and it was up only $29 DPs.  This has become an incredibly hard market to trade since the IV has become so extreme that if you want to trade an SPY position (as I did today) in order to make even a short-term trade the option prices are so absurd as to skew the risk to unreasonable levels.  The example today was a simple one.  At a price on the SPY around $259.50, the SPY 4/8 240 puts were $3.30…that’s a week from tomorrow, and $20 out of the money, for $3.30.If for any reason, volatility subsides, these thing will lose a major piece of its premium.  If you’re right, and it happens fast, great, however, if it takes more than a day or two, to get started, or moves up, even though it’s not what I expect, it just withers away.

Today’s Disaster Du Jour was Amarin Corp (AMRN), a biotech that got an unfavorable ruling on patent litigation related to a potential generic version of Vascepa.  The company said it will not affect worldwide patent protection.  The stock received several downgrades from Oppenheimer, Goldman, and Stifel, and after closing $13.58 yesterday, it opened $4.22 and finished the day $4.00 -9.58 (70.54%)
 
On the upside we had two winners with Vivus (VVUS) introducing a remote monitoring platform for use when there is Social Distancing.  VVUS is a long way down from its highs in the last decade but came to life today and after closing $ .95 yesterday with an open of $4.00 and finished the day $3.60 +2.65 (279%).
 
But the HOMERUN OF THE DAY goes to SGBX, maker of modular units for easy and quick construction received a MOU from Transcend Onsite Care to use their technology for container-based modules for medical care.  After closing on Monday @ $2.06, it opened $3.80, traded $9.74 and closed $9.30 +7.24 (351.46%) before continuing higher in late trading hitting $12.75 and is currently $10.35.

CANNABIS: This group was MIXED CRON -.69 (10.88%) the biggest loser, while CURLF -.22 (5.3%) and MJ $11.40 -.15 (1.3%).
 
DEFENSE: was LOWER with RTN -10.23 (7.24%), UTX -4.25 (4.32%), NOC -12.73 (4.06%) and ITA $142.90-4.67 (3.16%).

FAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL +.69, AMZN -25.95, AAPL -4.21, FB -1.20, NFLX +1.04, NVDA -6.09, TSLA +13.37, BABA +.23, BIDU +1.05, BA -5.78, CAT +3.49, DIS -4.30 (4.31%) and XLK $79.48 -2.42 (2.95%).
 
FINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -7.12 (4.45%), JPM -4.75 (5.08%), BAC -1.07 (4.85%), MS -1.51 (4.33%), C -2.63 (6.57%), PNC -6.37 (6.31%), AIG -1.81 -1.81, TRV -5..59 (5.45%), AXP -6.14 (6.8%) and XLF $20.82 -.59 (2.76%).
 
 
OIL, $20.48 +.39. The stocks were MIXED even with the price of Oil trading higher. NBL was the big winner +.58 (10.92%), DNR -.18 (8.5%), and XLE $28.72+.10 (.35%).
 
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,596.60 -46.60 After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.
 
BITCOIN: closed $6475 + 95. We traded in another short range again today and finished mid-range on the day. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.12 +.07 today.

If it is trading at or below the dividend amount ( I am seeing about 1.41) then you are at risk.

I am thinking of targeting slightly OTM August expiry dates on puts to get the full impact priced in.    Alternately the other way is to sell OTM call spreads on up days.  Thoughts?

**What is this tool good for**

I posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!

**AMD, BABA, DOCU, TDOC:** These all had a good bounce off the lows as I expected. Some stocks dipped this week while these showed strength.

**LULU:** Will keep this open, plenty of room for error for things to go wrong and still come out profitable. The expiration is kind of far away, so if this gets to the 50-60% profit zone I will close it out. No need to wait a month just waiting for an extra 20%.

1447,My PERSONAL take on when to cut losses & take profits,,91,iibdmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/iibdmf/my_personal_take_on_when_to_cut_losses_take/,1598635619.0,"I know a lot of people in the option game struggle with this. Here is how I handle things, adapt as you feel appropriately.

The biggest thing to know about exiting a trade is that you should already know when before you ever enter it. Personally, I abide by a percentage on trades unless I had a particular plan in place when entering that particular trade.

A particular plan would mean knowing the chart and having a price target planned out. 

My percentages for swing trading are out of 1/4 positions at 50%, out of 1/2 at 100% and let the rest run to whatever I'm happy with. If there is significant time left on a contract, I will extend those percentages out, but that is a decision that I always make prior to ever entering it in the first place. The only reason I would change this in the middle of a trade is if bullish or bearish news would drop, then ride the momentum appropriately. 

For anything expiring within the next two weeks, I will retract those percentages down to 1/4 at 30, 1/2 at 50, runners. However! I have a pretty high risk tolerance. So you do what is good for you.

(Are you seeing a pattern about having a plan?)

There's a good chance you will be leaving profit on the table, and that's ok. You will never ever ever know the top. The best you can do is be happy with the profit that you get. 100% tendies is nothing to scoff at. Do not change your plan on the fly. Stick with it and sell according to your rules plan for trade. The worst thing is having a trade show big profit but you get greedy and then it turns red all because you got greedy. 

Which leads to the next thing, when to cut your losses.

This the hardest part, in my opinion. Its the classic gambler's dilemma where we believe that it's gonna turn around any minute now. And we believe that all the way down to that 99% loss. That sucks. So what do we do about that? Simple! You never take more then a 30% loss. Something hits 30% down, I'm out. Could it turn around? Sure. But that money is better off somewhere else. You were wrong. Your entry was bad. It happens. You could hold that and hope that it comes back and let it die, or you could accept that it didn't work and look for another entry or move on to the next thing. Either way, swallow your pride and accept that you were wrong. 

The notable exception that that policy is market dips. If the market is dipping and your trade is negative due to that, having a good fundamental understanding of market moves can give you that diamond hands you need to whether the storm!

The only time I will ever take a 99% loss is if I go into the trade specifically knowing that this will be a true lotto. 

Hope this helps some of you out! The big takeaway is to have a plan.",options

1449,A Different Take on the Poor Man's Covered Call,,89,f0swb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/f0swb3/a_different_take_on_the_poor_mans_covered_call/,1581175189.0,"**Background**

I posted last month about buying LEAPS spreads to boost returns for the long term investor looking to cheaply add a small amount of leverage.  I think I've found a strategy that I like even more, and I'm wondering if there are any risks I'm overlooking.

**The Strategy**

In a nutshell, the idea is to buy a single ITM SPY call, \~6 months to expiration, with a delta of around 60-70.  Then, to mitigate time decay, sell a number of call credit spreads at a 30 delta, one month out.  Continue to roll the call spreads before expiration, and adjust strikes vertically as needed.  Exit or roll when theta on the long call gets too high for comfort.  Profit/loss wise, exit or roll at any number you want really.  I'd keep it consistent on either side, i.e. close at 20% loss or 20% return on investment to avoid emotions.  Definitely don't enter without a strict exit plan.  

**Advantages over Buying LEAPS Spreads**

This is similar to a poor man's covered call, but there are some obvious benefits over PMCC and diagonals.  Your short term vega exposure is reduced on both the short and long options since the long option is only 6 months out rather than 1 year+, and you're selling a spread in the short term rather than naked.  Cost to enter the trade is also lower vs. PMCC.  And you're never selling anything naked.  Max loss is truly the debit you pay for the long call, less the credit you receive.  

**Why Try This?**

1452,It's scary to trade options on amounts of money that feel large.,,93,dt21uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/dt21uo/its_scary_to_trade_options_on_amounts_of_money/,1573152051.0,"My portfolio is now at about $800, which is an achievement for me considering I've put $850 into the account over time and lost about $600 while I've been learning.  So I've just about broken even so far, but now that I have this much money in my trading account, the idea of trading with this much money is daunting to me. (I know it's not a lot to trade with from some people's perspectives, but from my perspective this is the most I've ever traded with since starting)

Every move feels too risky, as such I'm trying to figure out what the best approach would be to proceed.

I think approaching this with a diversified portfolio and low-risk moves would be the best plan of action for gradual growth and limiting potential losses.  I don't want a big chunk taken out of my account at this point, and I'm more than happy with small gains over time.

But I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this fear of trading with a large (by your standards) amount of money, or making large trades.

This last move that made my money back was a move in reaction to seeing the share value of TSLA spike up in reaction to   recent news.  At which point I opened an ATM call (with what was my entire portfolio) and in the same day I made back the money I had previously lost as I closed the call within a couple hours. (I did not want to hold overnight for fear of the share value going back down and the share value had seemed to calm down.  Consequently, I sold on a near-high point when the share value had been flat-ish for awhile)

In essence however, how do you trade with what feels like ""a lot"" of money to you?  What constitutes too much risk?  Have you ever experienced this fear of trading with a ""large"" amount of money?  What moves do you make to still make upward progress with your portfolio, but without having this fear? (or having less fear at least)

The market performed the same, so all in all was a pretty solid week and am happy with the positions I entered, the ones I closed, and also the ones I still have open.

I get a lot of messages from people asking me when do I sell my position if it goes against me? When should I sell to take profit? When a position goes against me I will try to roll it out to a further down strike price and further out expiration date. I will usually do this only once, if I feel it. Otherwise I will just take assignment. As for taking profits, if I get a quick 60% in just a day or two, I will close and look for a better opportunity.

As an example, here are my positions I screen-shotted mid-week when I was getting absolutely hammered, and screen-shotted again Friday afternoon just before closing some out. You can see the positions are all the same, I wasn't stressed about having a red week since I was something like 16 wins out of 16 plays going into this week. Looks like I'll keep the win streak going for now. CRM is my only position looking contested right now.

 **What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

# Here's a few things regarding my strategy

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**CRM:** This was an earnings YOLO that went against me. I sold the $230 strike and the stock dropped from $240 to $220 after earnings. This play expires next week so if the stock price gets a pop back over $230 I will most likely be able to close at 50% profit. Similarly if it goes down I will most likely be getting assigned. This option will be extremely volatile since it's close to being ATM and also expires this week.

**PLTR:** This ticker wasn't on my watchlist last week, but when I saw it trading down 10% the other day I had to sell some puts. IV was/is incredibly high so I have almost a 15% return I am collecting through premium. My plays expire end of December, but are already in the green.

**TDOC:** I'm expecting this to continue it's uptrend and I don't believe my strike will get contested, but you never know. I will hold this until closer to expiration or if I get to 80%+ profit.

# Master Plays This Week

I've added a range of tickers with lower stock prices that I'm watching so you folks with smaller accounts can look at some options as well.

&#x200B;

**FROG ($68)**

https://preview.redd.it/5p5wbe1hkm361.png?width=2272&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9b768237410b87de7c8d0bdd6b12c358401dab8

I can't say I know much about FROG (Frog LTD), but I do know they have super high IV and premiums are verrrry nice. The stock was trading down 30% from the October highs, but has caught some momentum recently and is up 10% from the lows. Chart is still really new and trends are difficult to identify. I like the risk to reward selling a $60 put at the support line where it's bounced off of multiple times.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $60 put for $3.50 or $350 premium. Return: 5.8%. Break-even share price: $56.50.

2. Shares with price target $71-75

&#x200B;

**DKNG ($49)**

https://preview.redd.it/37iec9lhkm361.png?width=2272&format=png&auto=webp&s=e909f16248e063ea0e942ef9aab85125ae964475

DKNG has been bouncing around with no clear direction. Trend is still up and has some support in the lower to mid $40s and a very strong support at $36, but that would be a 30% drop from here. In my opinion any dip into $45 will be bought. I like this ticker for long-term as well.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Dec 31, 2020 $45 put for $1.80 or $180 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $43.20

2. Shares with price target $50+

&#x200B;

**CRSR ($35)**

https://preview.redd.it/82ahv6fikm361.png?width=2272&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f11c35acf1d0eb78841f0042835f55d7a8639c

CRSR chart has gone up and up since IPO. It has a huge breakout 2 weeks ago with an even quicker reversal last week. After the sharp reversal to the downside I like the entry point with selling some January 15 puts at the $25 strike. To lose on this position the stock would need to drop another 35% from current levels.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.00 or $100 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $24.00

2. Shares with price target $37-40

&#x200B;

**SFIX ($35) - Earnings YOLO**

https://preview.redd.it/bkm96pwikm361.png?width=2274&format=png&auto=webp&s=9edc7b63f8b45052b19448aebbd9bd6873617669

SFIX has been on an uptrend without merit. Revenues and profitability have been on the decline since covid. They tanked hard on their last 3 earnings on lackluster performance and dropped 15% on the last earnings report alone. Not good. For that reason IV and premiums are super high for next week's earnings report, Tuesday after market close. Normally I would say this chart is super over-extended, but the stock just dropped 20% last week. I like the level it's currently at to sell some puts for earnings here.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Dec 18, 2020 $32 put for $1.60 or $160 premium. Return: 5.0%. Break-even share price: $30.40

2. I don't recommend shares for this as since the stock is super volatile and can swing in any direction. I prefer selling puts and getting assigned the shares at another 10% discount, if it gets there. Otherwise I collect 5% return on premium in just 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

**PLTR (23$)**

https://preview.redd.it/mfrq0zgjkm361.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49f2e6e6fa05c89ba594bd802fb51ab2513b2b7

PLTR is similar to CRSR where the chart is too new to identify trends. The stock recent tripled before coming back down to earth. Currently sitting at around $23-24. We might see it come back down to $18, but I like the entry point here selling some puts 3-4 weeks out.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Jan 8, 2021 $20 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 7.5%. Break-even share price: $18.50.

2. I also like the entry here for a long-term hold. Shares could have a great return in the next 6 months.

&#x200B;

**RKT ($19)**

https://preview.redd.it/8cysr8xjkm361.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fa18a4114175b7dec96f21c0ac0de6dd648b925

RKT was on my list last week, but for some reason my post missed the chart and description. I added it again here. This ticker has been consolidating for 3 months just looking to explode to the upside. $20 has been a magnet recently and doesn't stray too far from the price. IV is also quite high for this name and can provide some good return. I'll be selling strikes below the $20.

**Positions I'm Watching:**

1. Dec 31, 2020 $19 put for $0.95 or $95 premium. Return: 5.05%. Break-even share price $18.05.

2. Similar to PLTR I see good long-term return here for shares.",options

1468,Record option volume in Tesla as sentiment swings to bullish extreme,,89,do428t,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/do428t/record_option_volume_in_tesla_as_sentiment_swings/,1572237128.0,"Tesla options shattered records last week, with 2.3M contracts trading in the two days after earnings, including Thursday’s record volume of 804K contracts, broken by 1.04M contracts Friday. Over the two days, volume was nearly 6x normal, with $1.4B in premium changing hands as shares rose more than $73, or 28%, to levels not seen since early January. 

Coincident with this spike in activity was a remarkable shift in sentiment from moderately bearish to extremely bullish, as shown by the implied volatilities (IV) of calls versus puts. Tracking the IV of Tesla options this year shows the general negative correlation with the underlying as the highest levels of the year are seen as shares tumbled in January, following layoffs, and again in May as shares slid nearly 30% over several weeks, followed by lower IV as shares stabilized or rose. 

&#x200B;

[TSLA Historical IV](https://preview.redd.it/zsjo0z0fm7v31.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3ed1e8e5febf8c5cb6c08ef5342162ce5ff616)

Plotting the implied volatility of 25 delta (Δ) calls and puts shows the consistent relationship seen in nearly all stocks, etfs, and stock indexes where the IV of 25Δ puts is consistently above at-the-money IV, and ATM IV consistently above that of 25Δ calls. This relationship translates directly to the implied probability distribution for the underlying security and is the volatility smile or ‘smirk’ that reflects the higher perceived and historical risk of a crash to the downside versus similar move up for a given time period.   

While higher IV generally indicates negative investor sentiment, the relationship between out of the money calls and puts, called skew, provides a more granular indication of trader expectations, even when general IV is unchanged. Last week, as Tesla shares took off like a Falcon Heavy, the put/call skew dropped to levels not seen since June 2018, with IV of 25Δ puts losing a full ten points, while the IV of 25Δ calls declined by 4, resulting in a net difference of less than 3 IV points at the 30-day term, the flattest level in well over a year.  Further decomposition of the difference to separate the put level vs ATMIV and ATMIV vs call level show similar historic lows, with Friday’s closing difference between ATM option ivol and 25Δ call near zero.

Typically, flatter skews are seen in stocks with upside potential catalysts, such as takeover candidates, while stocks with high downside risk exhibit steep skew. In pricing terms, steep skew means a greater demand for downside hedges, while flat skew suggests speculation is the driving factor. This time last year, following earnings, the skew in Tesla was nearly 10 points, making a one-month 90%/110% collar cost about 1.50, or 0.5% of spot.  Today, the same trade is priced about half that level- 0.2% of spot, and other variations of downside protection in exchange for forgone upside will see similar differential.",options

https://preview.redd.it/qou4zn63bup41.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=3735a49e96cd530f27acaa952642b7d1d184bcfe

**Resistance**: The top red line shows a resistance \~260. This is where the rally Friday ground to a halt before falling as investors went bearish for the weekend. Incredibly identifiable shooting star pattern broke over it and failed to hold those gains and the volume spike it accrued held through the collapse. Right now, prices bounced against it and are continuing to do so without momentum (look at the EMACD, momentum is failing and set for a turn around).

**Support**: The bottom green line shows the first support at \~254. This held through Friday before the EOD collapse and proved its strength after the drop this morning right after the bell. Without a significant buildup of momentum, I doubt $SPY will drop through this (again EMACD showing lack of momentum either way but set for fall).

**Trend**: A trend throughout this morning's trading was strongly bullish despite several efforts to break down through it. However, once prices reached the 260 resistance, the trend broke and has not been seen again. You can see volume tapers off as prices reached the resistance.

**Disclosure**: I am not your adviser or financially licensed; consider me a raging autist for all intents and purposes.

**TL;DR**: Market will fall today but not drop out, very bottom today would be 254. Break over 260 would show strong bullish sentiment if new trend developed above it.",options

Even excluding the exit from the appliance and furniture categories, comps were down 5.3% year over year.

Now, JCP has just $386 million in cash and short-term investments and over $3.7 billion in total indebtedness. Being so highly leveraged, the company is limited in its ability to obtain additional financing.

- 2.25 puts for /ES @ 9:51AM 

- $5.10 IC for $SPX @ 10:00AM

**Max Return on Investment:**  110% (Risking $713 to make $787)

**PoP:** 50% 

###Why I made this play

I chose to make an IC today I collect more credit than the 0d condors I did in the past and don't think the market will move much from the fed speech Friday morning after it didn't move much following the minutes being released yesterday.

I meant to make this play on $SPX but chose /ES accedentally because the prices were so close and didn't pay attention until after I was filled. Once I figured it out, I made the same play on SPX, but kept the play on /ES alive as 1.5 effective spreads on the S&P is close enough to the 2 spreads I originally wanted to do on $SPX. 

###Intended exit method

Close wings for 0.50 or less/expire worthless. 

###What I will do if the trade is challenged?

There was almost a $30 swing last night on /ES, I probably will not do anything until 30min before market hours tomorrow, but will definatly enter a short more calls if we go below $2900 today.

1484,Exercise & Assignement - A Guide,,86,cqg536,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/cqg536/exercise_assignement_a_guide/,1565817808.0,"**Exercise & Assignment:**  There are many questions asked over and over with exercise and assignment being among the most common and repetitive.  I was asked to put together a guide that can hopefully be used to answer many of these so here it is!

**Buyer and Seller Definitions:**

**- Option Buyer:** Purchases the option from the option writer/seller and pays them a premium.  The buyer has the right to exercise the option at any time and assign stock to the seller that they are obligated to buy or sell (based on the type of option) at the strike price.  The buyer profits from the option price going up.

**- Option Writer/Seller:** Writes and sells the option to the buyer and collects the premium.  The seller has the obligation to take an assignment of the stock at the strike price if the buyer exercises the option.  The seller profits if the option price goes down.

**Buyer FAQs: (Seller FAQ below)**

* **Q1: As the option buyer do I have to exercise to collect the profit?**
* A1: No!  Any option can be closed to immediately collect any profit and save the cost, plus the risk and time of the exercise process.  Exercising early will forgo any extrinsic value that could be captured by just closing the option and is another disadvantage of exercising.  
* **Q2: If I Sell to Close am I under any obligation to be assigned stock should the option be exercised in the future?**
* A2: No!  Once an option is closed there is no longer any rights or obligations regardless of what any future trader does with that option.
* **Q3: As the buyer, I thought I had no risk of being assigned stock, but after my long option expired I got assigned.  How did this happen?**
* A3: Your option was ITM when it expired, and standard broker policy is to exercise any long option that is .01 or more ITM.  This means your option was profitable and the broker exercised it to protect that profit which resulted in stock being assigned.  To prevent this from happening simply close the option and collect the profit prior to it expiring.  The position should still be at a profit so the stock can be sold (or bought) to collect it.
* **Q4: When would I want to exercise an option vs. just closing it?**
* A4: There are very few occasions when exercising makes more sense than closing, but one is if you want to own the stock at the strike price.  Because exercising is costly, adds risk and time it is usually better to close the option to collect the profit and then use that profit to help buy the stock outright.  On a rare occasion, you can exercise a long leg to cover a short leg assignment.
* **Q5: Should I be concerned with the short leg of my Debit spread being assigned?**
* A5: No, if the short leg gets assigned this means the long leg is well ITM and profitable.  Just close the long leg to collect the profit and then close the stock position, or exercise the long leg to cover the assignment but remember the costs, risks and time of exercising can cause unnecessary losses.

&#x200B;

**Seller FAQs:**

* **Q6:  Can my short option be assigned early?  If so, how often does this happen?**
* A6: Yes!  The option buyer can exercise at any time, but the odds of this are very low.  Data varies over time, but over 70% of options are closed with 25% expiring worthless and only about 5% of all options being exercised.  Of that 5% there are many traders whose strategy is to be assigned and then a lot more where the option is exercised at expiration, so the amount of options assigned early is a very small percentage.
* **Q7: How do I know if I am in danger of being assigned early?**
* A7: There is no way to tell with certainty if you will be assigned, but the farther ITM and the closer the option gets to expiration the odds go up.  If you have an option that is well ITM and expiring in a week or less, then closing or rolling it would be advised if you do not wish to be assigned.
* **Q8: What is short call dividend risk?**
* A8: Short call options have a dividend assignment risk on the day prior to the stocks ex-dividend date and this video will help understand the risk -  [https://optionalpha.com/members/knowledge-base#13](https://optionalpha.com/members/knowledge-base#13)   If your call option is at risk either close or roll it to avoid being assigned and be aware you could be responsible to pay the option buyer the dividend even if you don't collect it.
* **Q9: What happens if I am assigned and don't have the money to pay for the stock?**
* A9: Most full-service brokers will issue a ""margin call"" to you indicating you have exceeded your account balance and then give you 2 or 3 days to bring your account balance back to even or above.  Usually just closing out the stock position will bring the account back to a positive balance, but adding cash will do so as well.  If you do not close the stock position or add cash then the broker will liquidate this or other positions as needed.  Being assigned without having the cash is really not a big deal and communicating with your broker on your plan will go a long way with them to work with you for the best possible result.  However, if you do this routinely the broker may reduce your options trading level or close your account.
* **Q10: I was assigned stock, what can I do?**
* A10: You can just buy or sell to close the stock position and take about the same loss as the option position was in.  If you can afford to hold the long stock or short stock then selling covered calls or covered puts accordingly can help bring in more premium to possibly break even or profit over time.
* **Q11: Can the short leg of a credit spread be assigned?  If so, won't the broker just exercise the long leg to cover it?**
* A11:  Yes, any short option can be assigned at any time the buyer exercises it.  If this happens you can close the long leg that has usually gone up in value to help the P&L, and the result is usually around the same max loss of the spread when opened.  If the short leg is ITM, or very close, but the long leg is not, then there is a chance the short leg will be assigned and the long leg will expire worthless perhaps causing a larger loss.  Closing the short leg or position will take off any risk, or it can be rolled to reduce the risk.  No, the broker will not usually exercise your long option early, and will only exercise it if it is .01 or more ITM at expiration as noted in Q3 above.  It is up to you to manage your trades and you should not expect the broker to do that for you, even if it seems obvious.

1498,Do NOT lose sight of the long-game,,89,jobmv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jobmv8/do_not_lose_sight_of_the_longgame/,1604547729.0,"I mention frequently how important it is to keep the long-game in mind with investing. One of the most important components to this is when we have a down week, month, or year. Many start trading larger to try and recoup drawdowns - this is one of the absolute worst approaches to trading. It may work sporadically however when it doesn't losses start to compound exponentially. Focus on applying your strategy, steadily and consistently. Maintaining steady position sizing is absolutely critical. Below is a real example from a conversation I had with a friend today. 

I had a close friend share their portfolio moves this year and they took a fairly significant hit during the meltdown in March. They primarily trade short puts (I got them started trading) and were levered during the downmove. They have a consistent monthly return and in general a solid approach. They started closing positions on the way down to cover risk. They ended up taking assignment on a large portion of their short puts and had their entire portfolio nearly utilized. They didn't want to get stuck with their basis way above the current market so they closed their positions at a loss expecting to sell the corresponding number of short puts to cover the expense. They had around a 22% drawdown to this point. He needed to be heavily levered in order to recoup this cost - and he took the risk. As we all know, the market returned well and he was extremely fortunate it worked out. He risked his entire account to chase a 22% portion. 

In contrast, I shared my recommended approach. Rather than sizing up to compensate for the loss (which as we all know can easily continue), I offered the perspective of consistently applying strategy. The drop in March was a black swan event - extremely unlikely to occur and he did a good job limiting damage to less than 25% of the account (good showing considering he was leveraged). If he continued to focus on returning his monthly average of 1-5%, he likely would've ended the year down slightly BUT the account would continue to grow inline with expectations, reduce excessive sizing risk, and long-term would continue growing exponentially. Black swan events can cause some pain, but we need to keep them in perspective - they are extremely infrequent. 

Drastically altering size to chase a loss can easily cause catastrophic losses. Consistent sizing may be slower to recover losses but it significantly reduces likelihood of destroying an account. Keep the long-game involved.",options

Recap – FLEX spiked in the after hours yesterday and still managed to hold on to some of it’s gains. I exited right around $11 for about 7% increase. Congrats if you followed the trade. 

The overall market was slightly down today with the SPY closing at  -.22%. Despite a down day ON and WY ended up +.8% and +.68% respectively. Not bad for a down day. TECK didn’t manage to fair so well and ended down -.74%. I’d keeping watching TECK for more of a pull back before entry given it’s recent run up and the options discussed yesterday were bought with July expirations so there is time left. 

Only two picks today which is not unexpected with the market having a small dip. 

Here’s the Option Activity Summary for today - 

**June 4th, 2020 Option Activity Fast Facts –** 

**Highest Multiple over Daily Avg (with ADV >5k) –**  **GLUU with 34x its ADV of 7,448and 251k calls traded and 6k puts.** 

**Ticker with most contracts Traded – AAL with 1.3 Million contracts traded today at 7x it’s ADV. 886k Calls and 479k puts.** 

**Largest Put to Call Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) – CRK with 15.3k puts and 306 calls for a 50 put/call ratio.** 

**Largest Call to Put Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) – EROS with 10k calls and 202 puts for a ratio 50.2**

***1.***  ***Ticker : SU***

**Special Considerations** : None

**Next Earnings date**: 07/22/2020  

**Option Information :** 

**Today’s Option Volume :** 45,754  **Average Daily Volume :** 3,078   **Multiple over ADV** : 15

**Total Calls :** 43,507  **Total Puts :** 2,347  **C/P Ratio :** 18.5

**Calls at ask % :** 40%  **Calls at bid % :** 28%  

**Puts at ask % :** **13%**  **Puts at bid % :** 9%

**Notable strikes :** Jun 19 ’20 19C, 19.5C, 20C combined had \~31k total volume today.

**My Impression :** This stock had a 15x increase over the ADV with an aggressive slant towards calls. The strike with the most play is the Jun 19 ’20 19C so it is already in the money. Not highly unusual, but probably a decent chance of going up if you are looking to invest.

***2.***  ***Ticker : ZUO***

**Spot Price** : $12.70

**Company Summary :** (from Yahoo Finance): Zuora, Inc. provides a cloud-based software on a subscription basis that enables companies in various industries to launch, manage, and transform into a subscription business. It offers Zuora Central platform, an intelligent subscription management hub that allows customers to create an order-to-revenue process.

**Special Considerations** : ER was yesterday. 

**Next Earnings date**: 08/26/20

**Option Information :** 

**Today’s Option Volume :** 23,924  **Average Daily Volume :** 2940   **Multiple over ADV** : 8

**Total Calls :** 22,228  **Total Puts :** 2166  **C/P Ratio :** 10.2

**Calls at ask % :** 29%  **Calls at bid % :** 28%  

**Puts at ask % :** 22%  **Puts at bid % :** 20%

**Notable strikes :** Jun 19 ’20 13C, 14,C, 15C for a combined volume of \~15k contracts traded. 

**My Impression :** This is a cloud software company. It looks to have gone down in sympathy with CLDR. It appears that the call buyers believe it is oversold with a C/P ratio of 10.2. It’s a reasonable bet it will climb higher in the next few weeks. 

Other stocks with high option volume activity include - BUD, FOLD, RUTH, AAL, AZN, LYB, CIM, NG

&#x200B;

Summary : I will likely be sitting these two out as I am near my account limit from the trades from yesterday. I do think these plays are good candidates to hold over a few week time period, but these don't smell like stocks people are buying calls based on insider information. 

Thanks for reading.

Recap –

The Spy ended down -5.5%, it’s worst day in three months. Other indices followed with the DIA down -6.5% and the QQQ down -4.6%. Investors are fearing a coming second wave and the FED comments yesterday about the considerable risks to the economy weighed heavily on the markets today.

Yesterday’s momentum picks were SNE and TDC which unsprisingly both ended down -3.57% and -9.8% respectively. I sat out both of these trades. I was stopped out on EVRI which I sold for a loss of $1.50.

**My Impression :**. This is clearly a CoVID-19 play. With the angst of a coming second wave I would look for this stock to have strength. In late February this stock popped to $50 and has since hovered between $9 and $19. This may not be a bad play for a bull put and I will consider this tomorrow depending how the morning plays out.

**JUL 17 ’20 10P– 7.1k VLM and 1.96k OI.**

**My Impression :**. This is a basic materials stock that specializes in iron ore and raw materials to make steel in Brazil. In late February the stock was valued \~$12 with a low of \~$6.50. It is no secret that Brazil is poorly handling the CoVID-19 crisis. As of June 5th, the government shut down the official website with CoVID-19 daily reports and stated it will no longer report total number of deaths or active cases. They are now only reporting new cases in deaths in past 24 hours. Check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Brazil) for more information, the graphs at the bottom are especially interesting. Additionally, the demand for iron ore and steel is likely to decrease as global GDP decreases. This stock has two huge factors weighing on it negatively. I will watch this one closely tomorrow, the puts are still pretty cheap.

**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY –**

Summary :

Trading during trend changes is always hard as anyone who has followed these posts over the past few days can attest to. Trends often start and stop with large volume and today we saw a very aggressive downturn. The volume today was 190 million for the SPY. The last time it exceeded that volume was April 7th of 2020. Some of the stocks that did not participate in the selloff were CoVID-19 stocks such as PTON, ZM,NFLX. This leads me to believe the selloff is most likely related to fears of a CoVID-19 resurgence and represents a rotation back to stocks that will do well during a pandemic. I noticed a number of 3x leveraged short ETFs having substantial volume today. I have not seen this since the last sell off in March. I do think there is likely to be more of a sell off to come and will only be entering positions with capped losses.

1524,SHLL Potential Play with HYLN IPO,,84,j0caw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0caw1/shll_potential_play_with_hyln_ipo/,1601148982.0," 

[The SPACs](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/24/why-electric-vehicle-blank-check-stocks-are-gettin/) took a beating last week but what I want to know is with the actual IPO of Hyliion what do you see happening for the underlying of SHLL? The reason I ask is because there will be no options available for Hyliion of course *but* there are options and thus option plays for Tortoise, the blank check company; I do know that the SPACs are [""under investigation""](https://dealbreaker.com/2020/09/clayton-has-spac-questions) but Clayton seems to be playing a far more aggressively pro-corporate game. If this is the case my guess is that the frenzy (?) for HYLN will cause some kind of backwash within SHLL itself.

I guess what I know from you is your sentiment. Do you trust SPACs after NKLA? Is there money to be made on this play of the underlying SPAC?",options

I simply wanted to share one of my main thoughts again that came up recently after speaking with a bunch of other (stranger) traders, particularly with anyone who (""day""-)trades options just like I do pretty much every morning.

If you want to make day-trading work, you truly have to stop looking at profits in terms of $$$. You need to simply focus on the trading aspect in itself. You need to understand that you need to execute your trades per your own trading rules you have already pre-defined hopefully.

After you enter a trade, if it goes against you, figure out what prevents you from executing and exiting the trade for a loss. Does it really hurt you to see/realize a losing trade? Is it because no one is there to hold you accountable for your own actions? Would it make a difference for your trading if you had a partner sitting beside you to slap your face every time a trade goes against you literally forces you to execute and exit for a loss? I believe it would make a BIG difference in terms of enforcing a good habit into you to start accepting losing trades.

**Losing trades are all part of this game.** They are guaranteed to happen over the life of your trading career. Accept them for what they are. They're there to help you get better as a trader. They're not your enemy. The quicker you learn that and really start to embrace them as your ""friends"", the better and sooner you will turn into a profitable trader. You see, if you cut a losing trade ""early"", not only will you have not wasted a lot of time, but you'll also allow for more time to spot another trading opportunity that could erase the loss you just experienced and realized.

Let me give you an example:

Let's say you want to risk $200 for this one particular trade. You ""decide"" that this chart looks bearish.

You buy a PUT contract for $1.98 (right around $200 basically), just perfect per your own risk tolerance/trading plan.

If now the trade goes against you and 5 or 10 minutes later that contract now is at $1.64, you should simply NOT ASK QUESTIONS as to why it's losing value or look for various other reasons to fight the fact that you are in fact losing (check for news, look to put on other indicators for the excuse to hold onto the trade much longer, etc..etc..).

**Just execute** (imagine your partner slapping you in the face right this moment to make you press the SELL button) **and exit the trade!**

You have to trade like that. By doing this over and over on every trade transaction, you will instill this wonderful thing we all call **HABIT**. It's a great thing to have for trading in general. Anything you do out of habit, requires little to no emotions. You may not even have to think about it because it just ""automatically"" happens.

Someone, who has a habit of running 5 miles every day after a long day at work, would be considered to be ""**disciplined**"" by many others. You want people to call you that ""disciplined"" person, because they cannot do it themselves. They believe it requires TOO much will power and, well, discipline to continue running 5 miles every day after work. To you, however, it's just a habit. You seem to do it so effortlessly, because it's basically automatic.

Now take that habit back into your trading world. You want habits that enable and help you become profitable over the long term. Executing (perfectly) and accepting a losing trade is such a great habit. Learn that skill (for life) and no one can ever take it away from you. You could lose your house, your car, your employment (*bless all people affected by COVID-19 in one way or another out there in the world!*), but you could still trade from prison if your life depended on it because you have learned to embrace losing trades.

**Don't focus on $$$.**

**Focus on trading and executing properly.**

**It truly goes a long way.**

With that said, I'll leave you with some more inspirational screenshots (so you can get back to work and make, what I just posted about, work for your own trading. Good luck!)

**Money will follow correct actions.**

View in terms of percentages, not necessarily at just dollar amounts.

You can grow a small account and you can also just do all this with part-time trading (I only ""trade"" for less than 30 minutes a day).

Just work on the trading aspect. Learn this life-long skill that no one can ever take away from you. You could trade until your death bed if you so wish.

You can work at this and for instance pay yourself a ""free"" car if you'd like: $30/day from ""simple"" trading would give you $600 in a month which would you can turn around and use for your car payment, insurance payment + free gasoline expense.

Being consistent comes from being disciplined.

Luck also follows the people that are consistent.

You can do it too.

Blame yourself for every mistake that happens with trading (point a finger at others & 3 fingers point back at yourself).

If you are one of the few who follow my posts/progress, you should know that my [last frequent payday (withdrawing money from my accounts) was on 06/04/2020](https://imgur.com/a/rM34mDs). I took out $1,818 and it reset my combined accounts back to $3,500. You can see for yourself where I am at today. Next payday coming up again soon (or perhaps I keep growing it, we'll see).

**Also, greed kills** (just wanted to say that again to remind everyone).

1526,Tesla call spread with short strike now at the money,,86,hbixm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hbixm8/tesla_call_spread_with_short_strike_now_at_the/,1592500796.0,"A month ago I posted about Tesla (when it was $830) and compared a call spread (the July 830/1000)  vs the 1000 call because they were similar prices ($55 on the spread, $47 on the call). Here was [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gij559/higher_probability_trading_in_high_dollar_stocks/).

One of the things you often hear traders talk about (and it's even discussed in the comments on that post) is when doing a multi-leg trade, if the move happens too quickly, sometimes you wish you had just done something more 'simple'.

In this case TSLA hit the target of $1000 a month 'too soon'. I revisited these trades today and to compare how they performed vs eachother.

But more importantly, I wanted to show how I manage a vertical spread when it's gone ITM and hit its target with alot of time to go til expiration. I'm not sure a ton of people understand that flip... from going long premium with decay *against* you... to long premium and decay *with* you.

It's a cool concept to understand and can then be used to help form a mental stop in the stock of when to take profits.

To the trade. With TSLA $1000, at the target, but with a month to go, buying the 1000 call would have worked great. It is now trading $80, a gain of $33 dollars.

But let's compare that to the 830/1000 call spread (long the 830 call, *short* the 1000 call). It's worth worth  $115. A gain of $60!

Now, the next question may be, but now the Call Spread is capped, while the call can keep making money, so the call is better now right? It is true that the call spread is capped, but right now it's only worth $115. That means if TSLA keeps going higher, it can still make another $55 (max value $170). And even if TSLA doesn't go anywhere and is $1000 a month from now, it would still make that last $55.

The 1000 call, on the other hand, currently trading $80, needs TSLA to keep going higher, above $1080 in the next month, just to not *lose* current profits. And it needs TSLA to get above $1162 to be worth more than the 830/1000 call spread on expiration.

For those thinking in theta terms, the Call has decay working against it. The Call  Spread... because it is short the 1000 call (which is now at-the-money)... has decay working *for* it.

As far as managing the call spread, it's easier than most think. Be patient and wait to see what TSLA does next. If it keeps going higher this call spread will continue to make money. Even if it goes sideways near 1000, this call spread will continue to make money. AND, if it does start to go lower, you have room. In fact, you can make a stop in the stock below (mentally) at which point the current profits would be at risk at expiration. Here's how:

The trade is currently worth $115. That means that in a month, if the stock is above $945, this trade will have made more money than it has right now. (it's intrinsic value is 170 right now, but it's trading 115, meaning it just has to finish above 830+115 to be worth more than it is now) That's a pretty large buffer to the downside where it can be worth even more. And to the upside it guarantees it will be worth more.

Account starting value: $5,000.00

Been a slow week, in a place without service for the most part (Grand Canyon) so just getting around to posting now.

**My Goals (in priority order):**

* To not blow up my account
* To become more comfortable trading options
* To help others learn from my successes / failures

**Lessons Learned (and applied):**

* Sell options with a longer expiration in order to collect more premium. (30-45 DTE, to benefit from Theta decay)
* Sell Puts on a stock that I wouldn't mind holding long-term if assigned.
* Trade more than just stocks. (Look into commodities, ETFs, and bonds)
* Close trades for a profit during uncertainty / Don't be greedy (No service, earnings announcements, etc.)

**Strategies Used (so far):**

* Cash-Secured Puts

**Future Strategies (to apply):**

* Covered Calls
* Credit Spreads (Bearish and Bullish)

**Week Three Starting Net Liq: $4,981.38**

**Current Trades (Open): 2**

*Last Week: Closed 2 Positions*

* Ford: Bought 1, 1/17 F Put @ $9.00 strike, debit paid; $2.85. **Net Profit: $3.00**

Could've waited for this trade to expire last Friday and would have received the entire credit as profit, but decided to take it off, as I didn't want to get greedy, my entry wasn't the best (12 DTE on entry), and I knew I was heading into an area with little to no service.

* GoPro: Bought 1, 1/17 GPRO Put @ $4.00 strike, debit paid; $1.85. **Net Profit: $2.00**

Similar to the above trade, I could have let this trade expire last Friday and received the entire credit as profit, but due to the above factors, I decided to take my profit and walk away.

*This Week: Current 2 Positions, Open*

* US Oil Fund: Sold 1, 2/21 USO Put @ $12.00 strike, net credit received (after fees); $12.85

Still watching this trade patiently, USO has lingered closer to my $12.00 strike (currently sitting at $12.26). Hoping to hold this position for another 10 days, and roll it forward in time for a credit.

* General Electric: Sold 1, 2/21 GE Put @ $11.00 strike, net credit received (after fees); $18.85

GE has done me well, by taking a 5% jump shortly after selling this Put. That being said, earnings is in 7 days so who knows what will happen. If GE stock drops less than 6%, stays where it is, or rises at all, I should be fine. I also hope to roll this position forward for a credit around the 21 DTE range.

**Week Three Ending Net Liq: $4,988.10**

**Week Three P/L: 0.13%**

**Total P/L: -0.23%**

*Future Pursuits (upcoming weeks):*

Gonna be moving a bit this week and next, but will be monitoring my 2 open positions carefully. Will probably start putting on credit spreads in ~ a week or so (Week 5).

Below is a list of things I hope to implement in my trading in the near future;

* Roll CSPs when close to expiration, to reinvest capital and collect more premium. (Rolling for a net credit, if possible)
* Roll in one, two-legged trade to cut down on fees.
* Try not to roll through earnings. (On undefined risk trades)
* Use ETFs in attempt to avoid some large, unexpected moves. Also more likely to find liquidity.
* Sell Credit Spreads, instead of CSPs, to free up capital requirement and put on more trades. (Less capital at risk)
* Sell securities with an IVR of 50%+ for higher premium.

*Please let me know what you guys think, any advice or suggestions are appreciated, though applied at my own discretion.*",options
1528,"A possible example of ""gamma flip"" for tomorrow (2020-01-08)",,82,elk5e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/elk5e1/a_possible_example_of_gamma_flip_for_tomorrow/,1578441305.0,"Hey folks, there's a ""buzz word"" the talking heads on trading media have been talking about a lot recently, ""gamma flip"".

***EDIT: for clarity, when I wrote this the SP500 futures were very strongly down, at around 3185 (down 50 points from the close, or around -1.5% down). They have since recovered spectacularly, and are at 3225-ish as of this edit. At the current levels, we likely won't see ""gamma flip"" tomorrow. I'll leave this post anyways as it might be useful to discuss the concept.***

That's a term they're using to describe a situation in which prices move to regions where Market Makers have more short options than long options. This is usually *""a reasonable amount below the market""* on the **SP500** if we're in a relatively steady bull market. This is because investors like to buy collars to protect their portfolios, so they buy OTM puts and sell OTM calls. This means MMs usually have short OTM puts and long OTM calls ""around the market"".

Once the market moves down to that region of MM short gamma, MMs start getting too much positive delta (negative gamma + market falling = increasing delta), which they'll generally look to neutralize.

Due to the recent news of what seems to be an Iranian attack against the US in the Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq, the SP500 futures are selling off very strongly tonight. If this down move continues until tomorrow, and if we get close to or below the 3180 area by tomorrow's close, this idea of ""gamma flip"" will likely manifest itself in the form of MMs hedging their excessive positive delta by selling a lot of ES futures. This behavior tends to intensify around 1h to 30min before the close.

Might be an interesting thing to watch! If you have access to a DOM and the Tape, it might be fun to look at ES futures, or even SPY, tomorrow near the close.

The SP was 350.  I thought it was a nice middle ground between the top and bottom, so I started a short strangle.

I used the strategy where if the SP got too close to one of my strikes, I would just shift both the call and put side to re-center it, give up a bit of premium.  

That was a month ago.  Today, it's at 530.  I've lost over 100k and I have about 75k in premiums remaining.  Basically, I'd shoot a goat in order to just break even at this point.  Short straddles don't really seem to work if the SP goes up huge almost every single day it seems.  Only reason I'm still in it is because I want to see how it ends.  

I still maintain a nice 50 point gap between the SP and both call and put side.  I re-centered my strikes today and it looks like I'll have to re-center it tomorrow as well.  Has anyone been in my bizarre situation?  I have 3 weeks or 14 trading days remaining on my options.  

What happens if it continues to go up almost every single day and I have to continually readjust and re-center it 2-3 times a week?

What’s the value versus on-line brokerage, like, eTrade pro, as an example?

1554,Strategy & Routine,,77,9fxgta,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9fxgta/strategy_routine/,1536972978.0,"
I'm about three months into options trading - not counting previous time learning (month or so) and paper trading (another month). I had posted this strategy on the Noob thread previously, but wanted to expand a bit and provide some information on my gains three months in. 

Essentially my strategy is a mix of monthly vertical credit spreads (mix of put/call) 30-40 DTE. The spreads are placed on a variety of underlyings, but mainly the rolling portfolio typically is composed of 1-2 broad index ETFs (SPY, DIA, QQQ), 1-2 Emerging Markets ETFs (FXE,  EEM, FXI), 2-3 Commodities (GDX, USO, XOP, etc), 1-2 Sector ETFs (too many options to list), and finally 3-5 individual stocks that I have done FA and TA on (avoiding earnings typically). Each trade is between 1-5% of my portfolio. My account size is 20-25k currently.

I write the spreads at 20-30 delta. I beta weight the portfolio weekly and add new positions or remove old ones to stay very close SPY. 

For profits - and this is difficult to explain - based on my goals, I take profits at 50% + commission cost. I have well defined monthly profit goals for the portfolio, and since most of my positions are written at 70-75% profitability, I try to open/close enough positions in each contract month such that if you calculate the total # of positions @ 50% profit-taking, 70% of that total number would be my goal. If I get more, great! Hope that made sense.

So I do all of this with quite a busy schedule. I have a fairly demanding full-time job (60 hr/wk) and am a relatively new father (two kids under 5). Sticking to my plan is essential as I cannot really afford the time to trade emotionally.

My daily trading routine is this: 

Morning: first thing over a cup of coffee, I check the futures. Usually this is around 5am or 6am. No more than literally 5 minutes. It helps me subconciouslly process the trading day ahead in relationship to my portfolio. (I say subconciouslly because my brain is barely working until halfway through the cup o joe). I usually check this on Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg TV. Bloomberg also affords me the opportunity to see what stupid thing Elon Musk did as well. I also have a crush on Abigail Doolittle and want to catch her any time I can. 5 minutes and done. Then I start my day as usual.

First check-in: I usually check my portfolio for the first time about 10-10:30am. I like to let the market ""settle in"" a bit before seeing my various positions. This first check is 15 minutes on a busy day. (And yes, if you are wondering, I do this simultaneously with my morning #2. TOS Mobile is awesome and I'm working on a catchy term for poop-trading) 

Anyway... What is key here is my profit-taking rules. Remember, my rule is 50% profit and I close the position. 

""But what if it goes in and out of 50% profit in the first hour of market open."" , you may ask. 

Pre-set GTC close orders my friend. Whenever I open a spread, the very first thing I do is put on a GTC closing order for 50% profit. 

So with my first check-in I take note of what positions closed for profit, which ones are looking close to profit, which ones are being challenged, and which ones are ITM. Typically, this first check-in I usually do nothing expect look at my positions. I don't open any new trades first check in. 

If a spread is ITM at first check, I will usually just evaluate why. Did it just bounce in? Has it been ITM previously? What's the DTE? Do I book the loss? I ask myself those questions but keep them stored in my head for lunch. 

Then, flush, wipe, wash, and back to work. 

Second (lunch) check in: 15-20 minutes on a busy day. Now if I have a free day, or I am really not busy, I will sometimes combine this with my first check-in. 

This is a no bullshit check. Close positions if I need. Hedge if I need. I only hedge by placing an opposite spread on an ITM one (ITM call gets a OTM put hedge and vice-versa). I only do this 2 weeks out or less. Then I look for trade opportunities, specifically based on my portfolio diversification guidelines and what came off the board that morning. (AMD closed for profit? I look for another stock. SPY put closed, I look at DIA or QQQ.) If I don't see anything,  forget it. I only look for easy targets. Done. Back to work.

Closing check in: 2-3 minutes, around 3:30pm. Did anything burn down? Is Buffet still alive? Did Trump cure cancer? 

No? ok back to work.

Final night check-in: Kids are put to bed. Wife is watching some stupid show with Billy Bob Thorton. I review the trading day, look at headlines, and look for new trades. Here is the first/last time I use the actual TOS  platform for the day. I look for trades, scan ETF, look at upcoming earnings, and beta-weight. I also setup my ideas for tomorrow's potential trades. This might be 30-40mins long depending how tired I am and the action of the day.

I also make it a point to throw everything that opened or closed into Excel to track. 

Close the computer. Kiss my wife. Check the Yankees score. Hit the sack.

From this model/strategy, over 3 months, I am at roughly 3% per month of my entire portfolio. Now OBVIOUSLY since the stpck marke is absolutely in the shitter, that 36% annualized return is completely due to my inherent excellence and genius. /s. My profits should be taken with a big salt lick and I understand I may need to modify.my strategy when we aren't in such a bull run.

Anyway- just thought I'd share. Happy trading!

Many people expressed interest in more elaborate trades, so I figured I'd post one of the interesting stories. To set the record straight:

* This is a premium selling track.
* These are not the trades to follow. It's a retrospective and physically you won't get these numbers now.
* Trader's rationale and thinking is the core substance, IMHO
* I always have something going in TSLA, this is merely a slice of the recent history. I won't be unwinding the pre\-history in full here, it's not the point.
* I will post some numbers, but they aren't meant to brag, just give additional context. It's a big number for person A, and maybe an underperforming P/L for person B. So take it as an entertainment rather.

I will try to address as many questions as possible in comments. Hope the sub enjoys!

\-\-\-\-\-

So it all 'started' with the mid\-March TSLA drop which eventually was a full 100 handles \(on a $340 stock non the least!\). [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:TSLA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:TSLA)

Actively defended a typical strangle, traded around it, rolled out, inverted. The end result:

* Stock sitting at around $301 on May 2nd \(reporting earnings after the market\)
* The position is almost a scratch, but giving up all this effort and juiced up volatility in a position is something I really didn't want to do.
* Full position wrapped around 0 delta \(\+/\- 100 delta was a rounding error basically, see below\)
* 20x tight 290/295 strangle in May monthlies
* 10x inverted 275/300 strangle in May monthlies
* 5x synthetic long stock

As I mentioned, there was no chance I was closing it all \(TSLA is great to trade in due to all the volatility\). Earnings reported after market that day, and an expected move was almost $20. TSLA never goes through earnings unchanged, so I clearly needed to do something, as with all the layers I was perfectly centered and didn't have any directional assumption. Also, TSLA can blow past the expected move easily, but given all the pressure recently already, running it into the ground was probably not in anyone's plans.

My breakevens were right around the expected move. My thinking was, that even taking it as is and breaking even would be a shame :\) So I decided to throw in some kickers on the short and long side. Usually I'd do it with ratio spreads, but I didn't want any additional undefined risk in the position. A broken\-wing butterfly wouldn't give enough kick either. I did something unusual for myself \- paid for debit butterflies:

* 10x $15\-wing put butterfly 255/270/285 for $1.88db in May 4 weeklies
* 10x $15\-wing call butterfly 315/330/345 for $2.11db in May 4 weeklies
* The strangles and butterflies overlapped nicely, giving that extra piece of mind should TSLA decide to go outside the expected move
* With such pumped up volatility pre\-earnings the max butterfly payoff could easily be 5x\-10x, which would cover for missed opportunity in the main position.
* All\-in cost about $4K. A cheap price to pay for a position with a theoretical $61K upside \(May monthly expiration\). I wouldn't hold it to expiration, so practical upside was less, but significant.

Finally, the ER comes out. No movement. I was checking all possible platforms, desktop, mobile, thought I was missing something. Something **was** broken, right? Nah, TSLA really didn't move. Until a conference call, where more stupid analysts started throwing irrelevant questions at Musk, and he had the arrogance of opening his yapper and basically GFY'ed them. Riiiight... There it goes, the \-$20 overnight, like an 8&#37; move.

Comes morning, all in\-arms, ready to fight the TSLA tape. Surprisingly, the delta was very reasonable there \(long, but not crazy\). So it becomes a different game. The strangles are giving back the money after the IV crush, but the butterflies are now all the fun. The call side one is dead in the water, even for pennies. I stopped bothering even, wouldn't cover the commissions with 40 contracts overall. The put one is more interesting, with the price going in and out of the sweet spot.

Here's the next decision to make. I want the butterfly to pay me something, but I need to roll into JUN while the cake is still very hot, and ideally uninvert and re\-center. So the price action is favoring either the strangles or butterfly, but not both. Ugh :\) A high\-class problem to have on hands, I guess :\)

* Sold the put butterfly for $3.02, a profit of $1.12 for every contract. Out of curiosity, I saw it trading for $5.50 at one point later in a day \(but I needed high volatility on the opening after the ER to get the best price for a roll, so... never look back :\)
* Uninverted the 275/300 strangle and left the same strikes. Basically paid less than 50&#37; of intrinsic value in debit for a $25 spread by selling a straight strangle in JUN
* Widened the narrow 290/295 strangle \(well, a step away from a straddle, really\) to 270/300 in JUN, and still collected $1.30 per contract. Not bad, that crush really wiped the premium for ATM options.

End of day result:

* $19K\+ up on a TSLA for the day, a tad bit long new position in JUN \(basically neutral, with 5x synth long skewing things a little\)
* New strangles at 35\-40 delta. They will burn fast, but require a watchful eye and active management and defense. Which I can all provide and then some
* Earnings disaster averted. New adventures await :\)

Few points which will be important if you read all the way down here:

* It wasn't a huge outsized trade for me. Yes, it grew larger than a typical TSLA position, but this was a result of fighting the $100 drop.
* It's a Portfolio Margin account. Don't try this with cash. At some point the margin was $107K, but dropped to $64K as soon as I rolled to JUN. Your gamma risk in action, 'they know' and charge more if you try to bring it all the way to expiration
* I'm not specializing my trades in TSLA. It's just another ticker on my board, which required some creative thinking this time
* I didn't spend all day babysitting the position. Had my one eye open looking at the TSLA price while adjusting overall portfolio. When a favorable opportunity shows up, it's time to make a decision \(and again, never look back :\)

This was my longest write\-up, I think :\) No outrageously sophisticated strategies, just a good old quick decision making \(and some hardened nerves\). Let the questions flow in!",options
1557,IV Crush / Implied Volatility Crush Explained (Video),,81,j7gcei,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j7gcei/iv_crush_implied_volatility_crush_explained_video/,1602174838.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZSwo2Zplf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZSwo2Zplf8)   

Hey Everyone, today we are diving into Implied volatility crush also known as IV crush. This is a short simple video explaining IV crush. This is a scenario where implied volatility rapidly declines leaving the option buyer with little to no gains on an option that might even be going in the option buyer’s favorable direction. It can also end in massive losses so its good to know how it works, how to avoid it, and how to take advantage of it.

So IV Crush starts when implied volatility is extremely high. This could happen from anticipated news on the corporate level, FDA approvals, or most commonly earnings announcements. Implied Volatility could go to 150%, 250% or even higher. Lets give a standard call as an example. The stock is trading for $50 you buy one call with a strike of $50 (at the money) and that call costs you $300. The implied volatility is 150%.  Earnings is tomorrow so the option chain is poppin with tons of people trading both calls and puts. The Delta is .30 The Gamma is .05 The Vega which directly correlates to implied volatility is .02 and the Theta is -.09. Now I’m just setting the scene so I can show you a Theoretical scenario that will help decipher IV crush.

So, our option buyer bought this call because he was speculating a positive outcome for the earnings report. Tomorrow comes and earnings is pretty good the stock is up 4% and is trading for $52. Now looking at this from afar you would think our guy made some money off of this option, but the sad thing is implied volatility now goes from 150% down to 50%. Now he actually loses money on this trade because of the IV crush or the implied volatility decreasing a huge amount. Let’s take a look how.

The stock went up 4% from $50 to $52. So, he theoretically earned $60 from Delta, $5 from gamma, Lost $9 from theta, and lost $200 because of Vega. Now how did this happen? Well notice the Vega was .02 so this means every 1% change in implied volatility the option price will increase or decrease by $2. Since the implied volatility went down the option is losing $2 per percentage of decrease in implied volatility. Since the implied volatility went from 150% to 50% this means it decreased by 100 percentage points which ultimately means the option decreased buy $2 times 100 which equals $200. So Mr. option buyer is now left with his call valued at $156 when he purchased it for $300.

A way to avoid this could be If you buy contracts before Implied Volatility starts to rise which could be a week or a couple of weeks before earnings to avoid the inflated implied volatility levels. A away you could take advantage of this which I do sometimes is to write option contracts (sell to open) when the IV is extremely high and cover when IV goes back to relatively normal rates. In a case like this I would write a contract for lets say $500 and IV is at 200%. Now it goes down to 100% and the contract is worth $200 and since Im the option seller the goal is to have this contract decrease in value, so I just made $300 profit.",options

Any last tips?,,80,ho5gy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ho5gy6/on_monday_i_will_start_my_longterm_portfolio_any/,1594309840.0,"After a couple of months of paying the steep tuition of the Options Trading University, I decided it’s about time to quit messing around and start building for the long run. I plan to begin from $1000 in a cash-based account and try to grow up for at least three years. I figured I am quite good with quick day-trades riding candles, and generally, I know how to make money but I have a hard time keeping it. (For example, I tried this 1000 dollars challenge already a couple of weeks ago, and I was up to $3000 in a few days.) So to balance this, what average return should I try to stick with ( I was thinking about 3 percent weekly, is that reasonable?) On this note, I'm always capable of matching these weekly goals, but once I'm done for the week, I make the mistake of switching to risky positions and actually go red. What's a solution for that? Theta? Withdrawal extra returns? Also, at what portfolio size it's more convenient to switch to plain shares instead of options?

I'd like to hear from people that attempted similar stuff, how did it go, what mistakes you made along the way, and what tips you'd like to hear if you were starting over again.",options

If you didn't catch the previous posts, every week someone is kind enough to post the graphic from earningswhisper.com for upcoming earnings. While I find it a great starting point, the list isn't well suited for option spreads without a lot of gutting. I used to do this and keep it to myself, but others find value, so I'm sharing it.

1563,Tradier API/Python script to download historical options data,,81,9nymxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9nymxi/tradier_apipython_script_to_download_historical/,1539476329.0,"Because sharing is caring...

After an exchange with /u/Saturnix about options data and the Tradier API, I wrote up a quick script that will download all of the historical data for a given options chain. 

First off, you will need to get access to the Tradier Sandbox API https://developer.tradier.com/documentation


Code here: https://pastebin.com/V5tbYLLH

Notes about the code: 

* This is not a full API client implementation
* Not a python package
* You *will* get rate-limited (60 reqs/min). I'm not going to implement a timer or anything else to get around this. Just wait and re-run 

For example, to grab the historical data for the SPY 275 put expiring 9/21:

`api = Tradier(""u/lazyear's API key"")`

`print(api.options(""SPY"").put(date(2018, 9, 21), 175))`

Will save a file `data/SPY180921P000275000.csv`, and output the following table:



| date      | close | high | low  | open | volume |
|-----------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| 8/31/2018 | 0.46  | 0.59 | 0.42 | 0.52 | 8703   |
| 9/4/2018  | 0.38  | 0.56 | 0.38 | 0.46 | 2660   |
| 9/5/2018  | 0.46  | 0.55 | 0.37 | 0.4  | 24482  |
| 9/6/2018  | 0.53  | 0.71 | 0.4  | 0.43 | 9659   |
| 9/7/2018  | 0.52  | 0.71 | 0.46 | 0.66 | 22739  |
| 9/10/2018 | 0.32  | 0.39 | 0.29 | 0.36 | 5603   |
| 9/11/2018 | 0.18  | 0.38 | 0.17 | 0.38 | 16075  |
| 9/12/2018 | 0.15  | 0.2  | 0.15 | 0.17 | 13317  |

Also provided is a method that will calculate all of the monthly expiration cycle dates for 2018 and download all strikes within a certain range, e.g. the default is to download historical data for all strikes that are 10% below the monthly low and 10% above the monthly high. If SPY was trading between 250-275 in September, then all of the strikes between 225 and 302 for the SEP 21 chain will be downloaded and saved.

`api.options(""SPY"").initialize_repository()`

This will take multiple runs to download all of the data for the year due to rate-limiting.",options

Today was pretty constructive in that we opened lower with the futures and of course the blockbuster news of Mr. Trumps tweet (which I find not believable) about and Oil deal between Russia and the Saudi’s, that sent us up to the high of the day +534, before we has some sideways action until around 1:15 when we started to sell-off and headed back to down on the day to -90 before we rallied and finished +469.93 (2.24%), NASDAQ +126.73 (1.72%), S&P 500 +56.40 (2.28%), the Russell +13.81 (1.29%) and the DJ Transports +93.13 (1.27%).  There was plenty of news to start the day with Initial Jobless claims that were double the prior number at an astounding 6.6million.  Unfortunately, the number next month will be higher.  Tomorrow, we have the monthly employment number for March as well as the ISM non-manufacturing pre-open.  I regarded today’s market action as very constructive.  The lower open and then rally and a second round-trip to a close near the highs was impressive.  While there is still plenty of work to be done, plenty of bad news on the economy and COVID-19 to come, we seem to be building some underlying support.  Market internals were positive but unimpressive with gains outnumbering losers by 1.4:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ.  Volume was also lower that I would have liked to have seen.  On the DJIA there were 25 gainers to 5 losers with BA -50, UTX -36, and WBA-18DPs, while the gainers were led by CVX +50, PG and CAT +36 and MMM+32 DPs.  
 
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 800 members.
 
 
SECTORS: Walgreen reported earnings today and although they had better than expected numbers, they gave less than stellar guidance and the stock fell to a lower low than the March bottom and made a new low close since 2013.  WBA fell to $39.41 and closed $40.32 -2.71 (6.3%).  We used the decline to buy some CVS calls, which has been consolidating and has outperformed its competitor.  Shopify suspended its guidance and the stock, another darling that was priced for perfection got slammed.  The stock, up from $20 in 2016 topped out over $593 in February had fallen to 303 last month but climbed back to $470 last week fell to $334.55 before closing 346.30 -38.37 (9.97%).
 
And last, the Disaster Du Jour was Luckin Coffee (LK), the Chinese Starbucks, sort of.  The stock spent 7 months between $15 and $25 before taking off on a run from $18 to over $50 late last year.  It fell back to $28 but had traded up to $43 last month before starting down and closing just above $26 yesterday.  Unfortunately, the COO was found to have basically fabricated all of the results since Q2.  Muddy Waters wrote up the company on 1/31 saying it had “evolved into a fraud.”
The stock gapped down to open $4.92, rallied back to $10.58 buy gave up the gains and finished $6.40 -19.80 (75.57%).  Clearly a disaster on any day.

OIL, $25.32 +5.01. The explosive move in Oil today was spurred on by an early morning tweet from Mr. Trump claiming that Russia and the Saudi’s were close to an agreement.  My first thought was BS, but the market held and finished strong.  My only warning is that we have had several of these spikes that have failed with news that we knew was real.  The stocks were stronger across the board with CVX the big winner +7.56 (11.03%) and added 50 DPs.  XOM +3.12 (8.13%), OXY +2.05 (19%), OAS +.06, NBL +.47 (8%), MRO +.33, MPC +.58, RIG +.02, APA +.68 (16.92%), BP +1.80 (7.38%) and XLE $30.15 +2.53 (9.16%).
 
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,637.70 +46.30. After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  Today’s rebound is of little technical value.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.
 
BITCOIN: closed $6,865 +655. After we traded in another short-range day yesterday we had a range of over $1000 today, closing about midrange. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.72 +1.22 today.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

1571,[Learning] Buying AMD $55 call expiring Jan 31 - Walk me through your logic?,,80,eqlhrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/eqlhrt/learning_buying_amd_55_call_expiring_jan_31_walk/,1579377731.0,"Hey y'all. New options trader here. I'll lay out my line of reasoning for wanting to buy this call, and whether you agree or disagree, I ask that you please explain why. I've gotten a pretty solid understanding of the basic concepts of option trading, but I'm really trying to understand how to apply that in real-world application.

\*\*AMD current price: $50.83\*\*

Based on the extensive research I've done, AMD's gain has consistently defied both analyst and investor expectations over the past year. Every recent article seems to be nothing but good news about the company, from management hires to new technology and increased investor confidence. 2019 Q4 earnings are set to be reported on the Jan 28th - three days before this call expires - and EPS is estimated on Robinhood to be $0.31, which is $0.10 higher than Q3s actual.

The only piece of information I've found that makes me hesitate was a single sentence in an article from an analyst who gave AMD a hold rating, who said that their main bull run is over. However, it seems like anyone who has said that in the past year has been wrong.

So, does this seem like a relatively good pick at this point? Why or why not? I know Delta and Theta aren't great, but are they bad enough to not buy this call?  


Edit: Wow, thanks for the massive amount of replies to this. I've already learned a ton more, which is exactly what I was hoping to do! As it stands, if I do buy this call, it would be with the intent of 100% selling it back before earnings are announced for hopefully a small profit. Not at all planning on holding it to expiration.

Edit 2: I bought it at $1.07 for the reasons listed above. It jumped up to a $30 profit almost immediately this morning and I learned my lesson about not being greedy...currently at a $3 profit. In Su’s name I pray. 

Edit 3: Sold the option for a $16 profit and bought the exact same call when it dropped down to $1.10...price of underlying stock has moved 2%+ since Intel announced earnings and its now at $52.63. Can’t wait to see how much this premium is worth when the market opens again!

Final update: sold that for a $22 profit. Chump change for many, but it worked out in the end!

## An introduction to options extrinsic and intrinsic value


**This topic is fundamental and essential for any option trader to understand.**

An option's relationship with the underlying stock's price is not linear.  


With an out of the money, or near the money option,  even though the underlying stock *does not change in price*, a trader  can lose or gain a significant amount of option value in one or two days, or, a position could lose money, even if the stock moves in the direction favorable to the  option position.  

There are two components to every option price.  
The **Intrinsic value**, and the **Extrinsic value**.  
*These two value components can and do move independently of each other.* 

The **intrinsic value**, is the inherent value of the option, as it relates to the stock's current price: **the amount it is in the money**. If the option owner exercises a long option they own, this is the **useful value** to the option owner upon exercise of the option: buy a call option, exercise it immediately, and sell the stock immediately after exercising: this value recovered from the option via the stock sale is conserved. 

In contrast, **extrinsic value** is extinguished upon exercising a long option, and lost to the exercising long option holder (and gained early by a short option holder upon exercise). 

The intrinsic value **does** have a linear relation to the underlying stock's price.  
The **extrinsic value does not**.    

- For a  long call, intrinsic value is the market price of the underlying stock, minus the option strike price. If this number is negative (that is, out of the money), the intrinsic value is ZERO.  
- For a  long put, intrinsic value is the option strike price, minus the market price of the underlying. If this number is negative (that is, out of the money), the intrinsic value is ZERO.

The **extrinsic value** is the remaining value of an option's market price and can be 100% of the option's value: *an out of the money, and an at the money option has 100% extrinsic value (and zero intrinsic value)*. Extrinsic value is fluff: it can be quite variable from day to day, especially overnight for an earnings reporting event, when it drastically declines, an event termed implied volatility crush.

Extrinsic value's variability is what prevents option value from having a direct linear relation with the underlying stock value. The extrinsic value is influenced by interest rates, dividends paid by the stock (time value of money), and influenced by market expectations of price movement and market anxiety (extrinsic value rises and falls, in part, on on demand for portfolio protection); this last component of extrinsic value is called implied volatility, or IV.

Extrinsic value is a reason that options are not often exercised prior to expiration: extrinsic value is extinguished (to the long option holder) upon exercising an option. The holders of a long option harvest extrinsic value by selling the option before expiration, instead of exercising. 

- Theta decay is the term for a **rate of decay** (time decay) of extrinsic value, in dollars per day. Extrinsic value approaches zero as expiration nears. Theta is variable; this daily rate goes up after a rapid increase in extrinsic value  (because there is more extrinsic value to decay away), and goes down after a rapid  extrinsic value  decrease (with less extrinsic value to decay away). 

The daily theta rate is a descriptive estimate, not prescriptive.  

The daily realizable decay of extrinsic value is typically overwhelmed by other influences. By realizable, if you were to close out a trade daily, based only on theta decay, you would find other influences on the option price are typically greater than daily theta decay. Daily stock prices change, and extrinsic option value changes via option price changes that are greater than daily theta decay rate. 

In short, extrinsic value change is influenced by several things in addition to theta decay.  

Even if everything stayed the same except for time (which they do not), with unchanging market prices, frozen market anxiety, unchanging interest rates and dividends...the estimated and theoretical theta decay rate itself is a non-linear rate of change: more linear-like and less rapid further from expiration (months and many weeks away) and further from the money, and more rapid as expiration approaches for at the money options (say, from less than two weeks, down to the last hours of expiration day).

- Theta rate of decay reported on your broker platform is an estimated potential daily rate of decay as of today, generally according to some variation of the Black-Scholes model, relying on the number of days left in the option's life, and the extrinsic value available today to decay, and the estimate assumes  an unchanged implied volatility, option price and underlying price.

- If you own a deep in the money option, for example with a delta of 80, there is not much extrinsic value in the option, and has mostly intrinsic value. This option, because it has little extrinsic value, is unlikely to have the underlying stock **both** move favorably in price, and also have the option lose money. Typically, for an 80 delta option, 80% of the price movement of the underlying will appear in the option's value. Contrast that to a delta 20 option, out of the money, that in theory obtains 20% of the underlying's price movement, and is entirely extrinsic value, highly subject to value change from other things besides stock price movement.  

You can have an occasion where you own a long option, and your broker platform may report anticipated theta decay rate, day after day (perhaps in the final several days of an option's life), when the extrinsic value of the option is increasing, and not decreasing (decaying), because of some event, like a forthcoming earnings report. One might conceive of these occasions as ""theta anti-decay"": when the extrinsic value's decay is prevented from being realized by the option owner with total extrinsic value increasing faster than the theta decay rate.   

The implied volatility value and the rest of the option's time value will eventually come out of the option by expiration, but it might be all in one day, or overnight, or the final hours before expiration, and not gradually as predicted by the broker platform's formulaic  estimate.  Occasions of rapid extrinsic value decline include the morning after an earnings report; after a major product announcement, and after a significant rise in the stock price.   This is what **implied volatility crush (IV crush)**  is, and when it happens, the option's extrinsic value is what gets crushed.

The less extrinsic value in your option, the less it is affected by unpredictable whims of the market, and this is why some long option traders choose higher delta options, say 65 delta and greater.  You can also experience intrinsic value crush, but only when the stock price moves drastically and that is a linear relation.

In summary, you will not observe a linear relationship between the underlying stock's spot price and the option value.  It will be more linear the more in the money the option is (high delta). If out of the money, or near the money both price movement and market euphoria and anxiety and expectations about the price of the underlying stock greatly affect the option price and value.

The diagrams in this TastyTrade blog post demonstrate how intrinsic and extrinsic value vary as an option changes from out of the money to in the money prices in the underlying stock.

###Why I made this play

Premiums were really high with the 2% dip yesterday. I originally had a bullish bias when I placed this play, but wanted to collect something from the call side if I was dead wrong. Call wing was almost tested so I rolled up my long call to collect a bit more credit. Decided to go more bearish instead of closing my short call and let my long call ride because the move was earlier in the day so there is more opportunity for the index to dip. 

###Intended exit method

Close wings for $0.50 or less/expire worthless

###What I will do if the trade is challenged?

Depends on time of day, and how I feel about the move. With the higher premiums for options, I think I'll have more flexibility with risk increasing plays like the one I already did, but calendars are almost out of the question with the huge premiums Friday's options currently have. Because of this, I'll consider morphing the wing that might get tested into a butterfly as well.

###Outcomes

Original Position (2865-2870-2900+2905 Iron Condor)  opened for $1.90 (x5) @9:50AM

Sold the 2905-2910 call spread for $1.2 (x5)  @10:13AM

Sold more put wings for $1.05 (x5) @10:41AM

Everything expired worthless, I paid $66.58 in comissions overall. @3:00PM
