Its fine to talk personal finance and encourage people to also pursue FIRE. Share strategy and general goals, but don't go into your specifics. I wish I would have received this advice early in the FI journey. Money has suddenly become a contentious issue with a family member after that person asked me for a substantial loan.

 I don't mean it to be on r/all.Stop reading if you are not from any of the FIRE groups.

As a FIREer, what is going for us is that majority of us who are more than half way there own large assets in stock market. I think a lot of us belong to the top 10%.

As the world plunges into chaos and unemployment is at sky high, a lot of us FIREers are making seriously good money in the stock market. If you re heavy on NASDQ index or FANNG stocks, you are killing it.

Does it ever cause a bit guilt in you that you are fairing so much better than the 90% population? That you don't even need to work and your portfolio is pulling in more money than average household income?

I do. I feel guilty. I work in asset management and I feel the whole stock market is so rigged that it's a way for the rich to enrich themselves. One of my mentors once told me that if you want to be rich, you own assets and businesses and hire others to do the work for you. One day, you will be making money while you are sleeping. I've dreamed to get there one day like him. And I did. But I have tremendous amount of guilt that I don't do shit and I make 6 figures a year just by sitting on FANNG and other Tech stocks.

3,"Is it just me, or is Rich Dad Poor Dad actually an awful personal finance book? Really don't know how it became a ""classic""",,5230.0,j6fyr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j6fyr2/is_it_just_me_or_is_rich_dad_poor_dad_actually_an/,1602026534.0,"The title is a bit harsh, but hear me out. I got really into personal finance and FIRE over the past say 2 years, mostly by reading Reddit and Investopedia. After reading so much about personal finance and investing online, I figured it was time to read some of the classic personal finance books. I started with Rich Dad Poor Dad because I hear it tossed around so much.

Now, I will start off with the positives about the book. I think from a mindset perspective, it's really actually quite good. Things that I think people should take more seriously are paying yourself first, knowing how to buy assets, having your money make money, optimizing assets, etc. All of this is great advice and certainly not enough people heed it.

My main frustrations from the book came from the specific examples that Robert Kiyosaki chose to give. Just to name some off the top of my head, here are a few things that he suggests over the course of the book:

* Dropping money in penny stocks and IPOs to make a killing (he cites one example of making an absurd amount of money off one... seems like selective hindsight to me)
* Picking up foreclosed houses to flip. Sure I bet you can make money this way, but certainly not great advice for the regular person
* Everyone should join a multi-level marketing company to learn how to sell. This one made me laugh... that is awful advice
* Investing in 16% tax liens. This one he even brings up an example of his friend calling him dumb and he is so smug about it when defending himself.

Those four were particularly bad, but I remember several others that made me scratch my head. I mean, the man acts like investing in a mutual fund is for someone who wants to live on rice and beans the rest of their life (to be fair though, I know low-cost index funds weren't as widely available / know about back when the book was written).

To add to the bad advice, it also annoyed me from a stylistic perspective that he acts like poor people are all as dumb as rocks and his cunning genius is why he's rich. I can only imagine the people who read his book and went out and joined an MLM and put all their money into tax liens and wonder why they never got rich.

In my opinion, this book should not be read by anyone who is planning on pursuing FIRE, there are so many better options.",727.0,financialindependence

6,[2 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,,4111.0,gwhxgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwhxgh/2_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/,1591279058.0,"Hi, r/financialindependence. I'm the guy who quit his job in the US in June 2018 with naive dreams of frugally solo traveling the world by air, frugally solo traveling North America via van camper and spending more time with my friends and family in between.

Background: I'm 40 now, ethnically Chinese guy in Texas. I started working in my early 20s after getting out of grad school. Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession ten years ago.

I spent my first year in Thailand, I accepted a non-paid, volunteer teaching position with a Ministry of Justice program there that teaches English and job skills to low-level convicts and former prostitutes. Click my previous thread below to get a breakdown of my expenses and experiences living in Bangkok, traveling weekends through SE Asia on dirt cheap airfare costing as little as $20 a flight sometimes, the cheap street food and so forth.
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

My monthly expenses came out to about $850 with free housing. Would have been up to $1,350/month if I got a fancy flat and paid my own utilities, which is still crazy cheap by western standards. That includes heath insurance, eating out every meal, mass transit/taxi fare and spending money for shows and nicknacks. My net worth increased from $2.3 million from when I quit to $2.6 million when I came home from Thailand one year later, entirely from paper stock gains.

Year 1 went almost 100 percent according to plan. The first six months of Year 2 did, too. I took separate trips from the US to the UK, Spain, Mexico, Florida, New York and Minnesota, all on heavily discounted fares. Because when you're retired, you can take all of the odd-hour fares discounted at over 60-70 percent off, right? I stayed with friends, got cheap Airbnbs or used my hotel points to cut costs. It was great.

2020 comes and COVID-19 hits. My trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong was cancelled. A trip to Italy soon after, too. Then separate trips to Nevada and Boston, too. My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million.

My current expenses ... I own the house outright so no rent is great. Health insurance is covered by my old employer (while still in SE Asia, I was offered a remote work job by my old boss, like set aside 60-90 minutes a day to answer email and have him bounce ideas off of me. I originally said no but was swayed when told I could get health insurance covered and my 401k matching when I moved back to the states, have done it since. A nice side hustle for a fraction of my old salary.)

* $480 a month for property taxes and home insurance. That's right, per month. Property taxes are high here, the joys of home ownership.

* $70 a month for auto insurance, two cars, two drivers.

* $130 gasoline and auto maintenance. They're Toyotas, maintenance is really easy and the engines will run forever.

* $220 water, internet and power.

* $120 a month for four smartphones on a Sprint family plan. Yes, Sprint sucks but it's a great price that I've been grandfathered into for several years. I get a free Hulu sub and a free AAA sub with it, too.

* $140 groceries. I shop mostly at Aldi and grow several greens and fruits in my backyard.

* $60 for random upkeep around the house. Replacing a broken sprinkler head, buying wood chips, replacing a broken weedeater guard, batteries, light bulbs, buy a bag of potting soil, stuff like that.

= $1,220/month. I'm not including eating out or going to shows or movies because I'm inside the house all day every day. My $20 gym membership is suspended, I don't want to work out in an enclosed space until there's a vaccine or proven treatment.

Plans for Year 3 are wait out the pandemic for a vaccine or treatment. Stay home in the meantime. I miss flying. I fully expect flying to be a more miserable experience with less competition and higher prices when is does bounce back. It's unavoidable, I get it.

I'm still looking at a van to custom build a camper for one to travel to state and national parks in. I've ridden in my friend's Sprinter a few times and I'm now convinced it's too much room for one person. I've also decided that a camper van with on-board water, shower and toilet is unnecessary for me, I can just use a Planet Fitness membership or pay for showers at truck stops or campsites. The custom builds being offered for Nissan NV200 cargo vans with pop-top roofs are intriguing. Would cost about $23,000 for a new NV200, then another $20,000 to $30,000 for the camper build.

I am also intrigued by the ""camper mode"" being offered in the Tesla Model 3. It basically allows you to run the car's AC all night without killing the battery, meaning a climate controlled room. The backseat can be folded down and you have a completely flat floor to lie on, with your legs in the trunk of the car. Third-party vendors now sell mattress and bedding kits for you to use to sleep in the back of your Tesla all night, it's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjC_ggNqbWA

Big drawbacks to a Model 3 for a ""camper"" is the lack of space and the sparse Supercharger network. We'll see, I'm in no rush. $38,000 for the standard range 250 miler. $43,000 for the 320-mile version.",396.0,financialindependence
7,Truck Driver: I will achieve financial independence and retire early by 2026. At age 30,,4039.0,iscqef,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iscqef/truck_driver_i_will_achieve_financial/,1600052667.0,"I‚Äôm making this post mostly for myself so I can come back and look back at it in a couple years and also to inspire others in similar situations.

A little backstory: It was the year 2018 and I was a lost 22 year old that was going to community college because I thought there was no other way to get out of lower/middle class. I was attending full-time community college, while also working 50-60 hours a week as a full-time uber/lyft driver. I was making around $250-$350 / week after car expenses. I was basically wasting my time since I had no time to myself and was working just to pay the bills. One day I was driving, my brother texts me a book that I should listen to while driving. The book was called ‚ÄúRich dad poor dad‚Äù. I listened to it and all the information went in the left ear and out the right ear without registering because I was too stressed from attending college and working full-time. 2 months or so go by and I start watching youtube videos on (FIRE) financial independence, retire early. I liked the idea but 99% of the people I watched had all these high paying jobs and right then that idea seemed impossible. Im stressed out again.

Around June, 2018 one night something clicked in my head that I can retire at a early age if I leave the united states and move to a low cost of living country. Since my parents were from India and I was raised in India and came to U.S at the age of 9. I would be very comfortable living there without any issues. I knew the cost of living there is so much cheaper than in the united states and I can retire early at age 30 if I really wanted to. I started doing my numbers to see how long and how much money invested it would take for me to achieve these goals.

As I became more invested in this idea, I decided not to continue my education after community college because I didn‚Äôt want to take out student loans that will eventually put me in the rat race where it would be difficult for me to get out of financially. Plus, I was only going to college for money. I started doing more research on careers that pay high income without a college degree and came across on-the-road trucking. At this point, I did not care how hard my life might get because I was set on one goal and that one goal was to retire by age 30 out of united states to a low cost of living country like india. In June 2018, I decided not to continue my education and instead went to go get my CDL Class A license. 

I got my license, got my 2 weeks of training and then drove for a company until August 2019. I saved up every penny after food expenses since I was living out of the truck. In August 2019, I purchased my own truck/trailer and got my own authority to become my own boss on the road. This is the month where my real journey starts. I have been Trucking with my own authority for almost 1 year and lived out of my truck and only went home to see my family couple times a year. I have cut out 99% of my expenses. No car, no debt, no mortgage, no rent and the only thing I have is food expenses and Netflix account and my truck/trailer payment. I finally saved up a good chunk of money that I am ready to buy my first real estate investment property cash. 

So far, my plan is perfectly on track and I should be able be able to retire at the age of 30 without a college degree. 

My numbers:

Current Age: 24

My FIRE number: $1000/month but I am going for fat fat fire and shooting around $4000. Even $2000 is close to impossible to spend in india a month. 

My pay: $260,000 / year gross and around $123,000 net after all expenses. I own my truck and trailer and have my own authority.

I am planning on buying 1 real estate property cash every other year and rent the property out. I mostly look for 9-14% ROI. I am currently looking at properties and waiting for the right one to come on the market.

In 2026, I will have 4 properties that I bought foreclosed at around $130,000-$150,000 price range and which will now be worth around $200,000 fully paid off and all rented out bringing in $4000 passive income and at that time, I should be able to leave the country and live my life freely in india and also travel the world because there is no way I‚Äôm spending any where near $4000/month in india. I will have property management company that will look after the properties and I will be available on call if I am needed.

9,Timing the market: Absolute worst vs absolute best vs early and often (Updated),,3682.0,iq30q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iq30q8/timing_the_market_absolute_worst_vs_absolute_best/,1599743569.0,"I downloaded the historic S&P 500 data going back 41 years. I dumped everything in Google Sheets and modeled three different portfolios named after three fictional friends Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah. All three saved $200 of their income per month for 41 years for a total of $99,000 each. But after 41 years they all ended up with different amounts based on their investment strategies.

# Buy and Hold

Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah all knew the value of buying and holding. And they all invested in the same thing: an S&P 500 index fund. Once they bought, they never sold and always reinvested dividends. But they had different strategies about when to jump into the market.

# Two Market Timers

Tiffany and Brittany were aware that the stock market could be very volatile and they wanted to avoid market crashes. It turns out they were right as there were five significant market crashes during the last 41 years as shown here:

# US Stock Market Crashes 1979-2020

|Dates of Crash |	Duration (Days)	| Percent Drop	| Event| 
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|8/25/1987-12/4/1987	|101	|33.4%	|Black Monday|
|7/16/1990-10/11/1990	|87	|19.7%	|Kuwait War|
|9/1/2000-10/9/2002	|768	|49.0%	|Dotcom Crash|
|10/12/2007-3/9/2009	|514	|56.5%	|Financial Crisis|
|2/19/2020-3/23/2020	|33	|34.1%	|COVID Crash|

# Tiffany Top invests at the top of the market

Tiffany, it turns out, has the world‚Äôs worst market timing. She saved her $200/month in a savings account getting 3% interest until the worst possible times. She started by saving for 8 years only to put her money in at the absolute market peak in 1987, right before Black Monday and the resulting 33% crash. But she never sold, and instead started saving her cash again, only to do the same at the next five market peaks. Each time she invested the full amount of her saved cash only to watch the market crash immediately after. Most recently she put all her money in the day before the 2020 COVID crash, only to see it immediately drop 34%. She‚Äôs been saving cash ever since waiting for the next market peak.

With this perfectly bad market timing, Tiffany still didn‚Äôt do too bad. Her $99,000 she saved and invested over the last 41 years is now worth $773,358. Even though she invested only at each market peak, her big nest egg is thanks to the power of buying and holding. Since she never sold, her investment always recovered and flourished as the market inevitably recovered far surpassing her original entry points.

# Brittany Bottom invests at the bottom of the market

Brittany, in stark contrast to Tiffany, was omniscient. She also saved her money in a savings account earning 3% interest, but she correctly predicted the exact bottom of each of the five crashes and invested all of her saved cash on those days. Once invested, she also held her index fund while saving up for the next market crash. It can‚Äôt be overstated, how hard it is to predict the bottom of a market. In 1990 with war breaking out in the Middle East, Brittany decided to dump all her cash in when the market was only down 19%. But in 2007, the market dropped 19% and she didn‚Äôt jump in until it fell all the way down to a 56% drop, again perfectly predicting the exact moment it had no further to fall and dumped in all of her cash just in time for the recovery. Just this year in 2020, Brittany wisely waited until March 23rd to dump her savings into the market, buying at a steep 34% discount.

For this impossibly perfect market timing, Brittany Bottom was rewarded. Her $99,000 of savings has grown to $1,123,573 today. It‚Äôs certainly an improvement, but interesting to note that when comparing the absolute worst market timing versus the absolute best, the difference is only a 45% gain. Both Brittany and Tiffany have the vast majority of their growth thanks to buying and holding a low cost index fund.

# Sarah Steady auto-invests every month

Sarah was different from her friends. She didn‚Äôt try to time market peaks or valleys. She didn‚Äôt watch stock prices or listen to doomsday predictions. In fact, she only did one thing. On the day she opened her account in 1979, she set up a $200 per month auto investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Then she never looked at her account again.

Each month her account would automatically invest $200 more in her index fund at whatever the current price happened to be. She invested at every market peak and every market bottom. She invested the first month and the last month and every month in between. But her money never sat in a savings account earning 3% interest.

When Sarah Steady was ready to retire, she signed up for online access to her account (since the internet had been invented since she last looked at it). She was pleasantly surprised with what she found. Her slow and steady approach had grown her nest egg to $1,620,708. Even though she didn‚Äôt have Brittany‚Äôs perfect ability to know the bottom of the market, Sarah‚Äôs investment crushed Brittany‚Äôs by about $500,000.

# Recap
* **Amount Saved/Invested**: $99,000 each
* **Investment**: Buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund
* **Tiffany (worst timing in the world)**: $773,358
* **Brittany (best timing in the world)**: $1,123,573
* **Sarah (auto invests monthly)**: $1,620,708

Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah aren‚Äôt real. No one can perfectly predict market tops or bottoms. But these numbers are real, based on the exact returns of an S&P 500 index fund and a 3% interest savings account over the last 41 years. [Here is the spreadsheet I used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBDkD9Zrjb3VZJy6ZjmPCd3ehoagKMIkw6m3WZvxeTw/edit?usp=sharing) to generate these results.

If you‚Äôre worried the market is too high and we‚Äôre due for a crash. Or you want to wait for the inevitable drop before you put your money in. Think about whether you‚Äôre so good at predicting the market you can do it better than Brittany who knew when to invest down to the exact day. And even if you are that good, realize that it‚Äôs still a losing strategy to the early and often approach that Sarah executed so flawlessly.

P.S. This is an update from [a similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/) I made a year ago. That's why it's the odd 41 years instead of 40.

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!",861.0,financialindependence

Some of you may have seen the recent hurricane that hit the Texas/Louisiana border. It was a massive storm that completely ruined the city of Lake Charles, LA. My town was going to be ground zero until a couple hours before the storm hit. It veered East and we were spared the complete devastation.

We evacuated Tuesday because our mayor begged people not to stay behind and risk their life. My company drug it‚Äôs feet on whether we would be ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to evacuate. It wasn‚Äôt until the judge issued a mandatory evacuation that we weren‚Äôt forced by work to stay. 

I woke up today and found out that our town and home were safe and sound. The storm passed around 5 am. I got a call from my boss around 10am asking when I was coming home. Our regional manager is now furious that we are not at work today (5 hours after the storm passed) and that we are abusing this to take a vacation. I told my boss that this was no vacation. Wondering if the house I‚Äôve worked my ass off to have would be ripped to shreds. Wondering if the nursery we have put together for my future son would still look the same. Instead of sympathy from management, the employees were treated like an enemy of the company for trying to keep their family safe.

I ramble so much about this because I work with people who have to take this treatment. Paycheck comes in, paycheck goes out. They have to endure it. I‚Äôm not close to my FI goal, but I know that on the horizon I will be able to walk away from a company that has reduced me to just a production number.

It is important to keep strong on the journey. I have questioned if it‚Äôs possible to be free one day, but now I know that not only is it possible, it‚Äôs necessary.",385.0,financialindependence

I'm still not fully back in the market.  Don't be like me.  

We all know how it should work.  Pick your asset allocation.  Squirrel away.  Rebalance.  Do some roth conversions. Keep living costs low. Build a tent to mitigate sequence of returns risk.  Sail off into the sunset.   

I could go into why I decided to sell everything and buy US Treasuries, but by this time in my journey, I should have known better.  But I did on April 1, 2020.  

Fortunately I had a plan to get back in, but that plan did not indicate re-entry until August 1, 2020.  But by then psychology was already working against my best interests, ""I can't get back in now! Near the highs?""  

So I determined to reinvest in 5 chunks.  I would set limit orders 2-4% off recent highs and if those didn't trigger by month end I would change them to market orders to ensure entry.  Well August saw no such pullback.  7% higher.  

$#@!  I put in August's 1/5 chunk and set orders for Sep, which all got filled yesterday in the sell off.  So I am 40% back into my standard 80/20 portfolio.  

I made a spreadsheet with my positions on March 31, 2020.  I compared that to the same portfolio on August 31, 2020.  The portfolio I liquidated was worth $1.4M.  That same portfolio would be worth$1.7M untouched on August 31.  

I missed out on $302,659.98 of capital gains.  To say nothing of the dividends I missed out on nor the tax implications of what I did in March.  

Some perspective: 

* That money invested would pay for college tuition for my 2 children just about anywhere for 4 years when they turn 18.
* That loss will likely push off my retirement by 3-5 years
* Or if I keep the same target date, I will have to spend about $25k/year less in retirement.
* Or I could have just quit my job, bought a yacht, and sailed the world for the last 5 months and have been better off.  

I know we like to say that financial advisors are too expensive, not worth it, etc, but someone who had simply said ""Don't be a muppet and stay the course"" would have earned 19 years' worth of fees.  

This is the behavior gap: the difference between what an asset class earns and what an irrational/fearful investor earns investing in the same asset class.  It is real.  It is expensive.  Good luck closing it.

Many people born in my situation never put effort into anything. I‚Äôve been reading books, trying to save money, seeking mentors/apprenticeships/resources since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 23 now).

I am very fortunate to be in the position I am in and definitely owe it to my parents who taught me strong personal finance values and paid for my education. 

Current assets: 

* Checking: $3,160
* Savings: $18,713 *- should I move this into an investment fund?*
* 401K: $32,376
* Roth IRA: $35,167
* Investment fund: $12,489

**Total: $101,905**

&#x200B;

**2018**

* January - Graduated college with a net worth of $20k, my parents paid for my college and I was lucky to not have student loans. I took extra classes to graduate a semester early in order to save my parents some money
* I was able to grow my net worth to $20k by graduation by always working throughout college. I went to school in a large city and worked year-round. On top of a full course load, I alternated between working for the school and completing external internships.
* I opened a Roth IRA my sophomore year and maxed it out annually. I remember thinking that once you put in money, it would just grow automatically... it took me over a year to realize I needed to actually invest the money. 
* August - moved to a HCOL city and started a job with $85k salary and $10k bonus. My rent was $1500. I have 3 roommates in a 2 bedroom apartment and my rent is considered pretty average for the location and space.

**2019**

* Throughout the year, I targeted a savings rate of \~40% (post-tax, pre-401k contribution). Being in a HCOL city, I was surprised that I was able to save so much while still feeling like I am able to enjoy my time with my friends and enjoy what the city has to offer.
* My work provides most of my weekday meals which greatly reduces my costs. However, I still cook on the weekends and would like to think that I would bring in at least half my lunches to work if it wasn't provided (may be wishful thinking)
* I religiously track my spending in excel and group my expenses into different buckets. I use these buckets to determine which credit cards are the most beneficial given my spending habits. I use credit card bonuses to pay for my vacation flights. 
* I also churn bank accounts and estimate an additional income of \~$2k from this.
* Being in a populous city also has the benefits of lots of app promotions and deals. I subscribe to lots of different websites/apps that offer discounts to activities and restaurants in the area, and I use these quite a bit. I try to regularly remind myself to only use the discounts on things that I would've done anyway, but I am curious if this one is actually saving me money or not.

**2020 and onwards**

* Received a bonus of $25k and salary bump to $100k, savings rate increased to \~55%
* I want to maintain my spending habits for the next 1-2 years. Although my living situation is not ideal and would really like to move to a no-roommate apartment, I anticipate potentially changing jobs soon. In the case I have to take a pay cut, I just want to make sure I don't lifestyle inflate too much just to deflate it later.
* Having an SO with a similarly frugal mindset helps a lot. We do a lot of stay-in cooking dinners and enjoy each other's companies just walking around the city and doing free activities.
* Although I realize I am very fortunate and have a high income level, I am still very proud to have saved this much. I try not to talk about finances too much with my friends, but I am consistently shocked at how little my peers are saving with similar income levels.",939.0,financialindependence

I'm 27, and have $125k in my roth retirement accounts. Even if I never contributed another dollar (I will!) I could keep the money in there until I'm 60 and, assuming 7% growth, would have over a million dollars to retire with. At a 4% SWR I'd be withdrawing more than my currently yearly expenses.

My goal isn't to retire at 60, and this doesn't factor in social security, but it's a huge relief to know at a minimum I should be able to retire at a ""normal"" age and not have to worry about retirement the way my parents do. I have the security to take a lower paying job in the future if I want, because I won't have to ""catch up"" just so I'm not required to work in my old age.

It's not the numbers some people are posting here, and I have a good job (military) that doesn't bring in the money some other posters do, but large savings are possible. I just wanted to share my milestone with people who may appreciate it, because I'm sure it would bring me some dirty looks from people at work who don't save as diligently.

EDIT: There's been a lot of comments about inflation. This is normalized in 2020 dollars. 10% historical equities growth minus 3% historical average inflation equals 7% real growth yearly.

My fathers expenses have more than doubled since my mother died. He has a degenerative disease and has to pay for people to come to his house to help with things like making food and getting dressed. My FIRE budget certainly would not cover these kinds of expenses. In our area, its impossible to find reliable home aids who would be covered under Medicaid after he runs out of money (which will happen this year). So his only other option would be a nursing home.

I've lurked here long enough and with the pandemic, social unrest, and tropical storm all conspiring to keep me indoors I figured now was as good a time as any to contribute to the community. 

Background: Grew up disadvantaged. Mom institutionalized schizophrenic, dad had other priorities so grandparents took me in and literally saved my life at 9 months old. Neither could read or write very well but managed to own two homes(that I now own) and were small business owners(maid and landscaper). Dad lived on the other side of the state but paid for catholic school which helped me avoid some of the pitfalls associated with abject poverty: busing, overcrowded schools, overworked educators, etc. So let's just say that I started the FIRE race a bit further back than most and had to navigate a few obstacles along the way. 

Graduated high school with a whopping 2.38 GPA and an 1170(old scale) SAT score. I wanted to go to college but didn't have the pedigree to make it happen. Oh yeah, I was the president of my high school's computer science club. I wasn't dumb, just distracted. Long story short, I joined the Service to pursue an ROTC scholarship and with a bit of remedial work and a fair amount of institutional motivation(read threats and punishment) I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and started my professional life. 

The Plan: At this point in my life (early 90s), I had a gig and was making the most money I had ever made in my life: $18,795.60(before housing allowance). I was finally housing and food secure and at 23 I had transitioned from poverty to the middle class. The plan was to complete my service commitment and join my peers in industry. 

You all know about the best laid plans of mice and men. Four years became \~20 years and add a wife, two kids and a couple wars to the mix. Outwardly my life resembled the Jones'. We had a single family home in the burbs, two great kids at great schools, and a couple of almost paid for cars. But we were net worth poor. In the late 2000s I would return from my final deployment to 22K of credit card debt, a rental property that was upside down and not cash flowing, while living in a rental across the country that we couldn't afford.

 Side note: In the early 2000s I stumbled across a book called The Wealthy Barber, and although I knew nothing about personal finance let alone FI, I knew that my finances were a mess and that I was mentally and physically tired. Something had to give. 

The Plan 2.0: The gory details aren't as interesting as the outcome, but starting in the late 201Xs and over the period of about 12 months I retired from the Service, divorced my now-ex, and founded an IT consulting firm. I hasn't been easy, but over the last 10 years the firm has grown to 40 engineers with annual sales in the mid seven digits. I've heard every possible version of no and been told on several occasions, to include by my now ex-wife, that I would never make it as a small business owner. Failure only occurs after you stop trying. I've also started up a new company that is product oriented. I'm getting to learn all about manufacturing and production. For a software guy this is uncharted territory and exciting to say the least.

FI: YNAB tells me that I'm well on the path to financial independence. For you YNABers out there the age of my money is over 30 with a buffer over 100. For the non-YNABers, I live below my means. In practical terms, I'm debt free with about 4 years to go on my mortgage in a medium to low cost of living area. I have liquid assets over 1MM. I can almost go tell my boss to GFY(oh wait.. that won't work).

RE: Like many others here. I'm not certain what retirement looks like for me. I'm receiving my military pension now(high 5 figures), and absolutely love running my company. I work on average 3 hours a day from home with the bulk of that mentoring and leading the team. It's something that I enjoy and can do from anywhere in the world. I travel as much as I like and when I like. Life is good.

I'll humbly ask that this story be added to the collection of others like it. The magic of this community lies in the ability to be more open about finances. My neighbors and all of family members see me as the youngish, lucky, retired military guy.

I want people to know you don't need to be a ""tech bro,"" or have a $100k/yr salary to start the journey to FIRE. I am a 24 y/o woman who came from almost nothing, and I am setting myself up for greatness. 


I didn't have the best home life growing up. I grew up in an impoverished area where 80% of people have no education beyond high school, my family included. A child of divorce. I have parents whose bodies broke down at a pretty young age. The works. I took some community college classes at 15. I moved out for university at 17 with some scholarships and lots of different jobs to keep me afloat.


At 20, I dropped out of university without a solid plan. I hated my major. I hated my research. I also struggled with a lot of health problems, including a brief period of (oral) chemotherapy. I rotated a bunch of little jobs and ran a small ebay business to pay bills. I eventually got into another school for a 3+1 program, but I had to wait until the next school year.


At 21, I was doing full-time unpaid clinical rotations and for a brief point, did not have a roof over my head. I slept in my car, crashed on couches, and relied almost exclusively on expired food from the sweets/bread truck from a guy at my site who drove bread trucks as a second job. The program before the rotation was HARD, but less impactful. 



I obtained a STEM degree on my 22nd birthday (yay!) with a -$28k NW. I quickly got my certification and started a career in healthcare with a pretty average salary, but almost unlimited potential for more money to be made. I work exclusively nights, weekends, and holidays. I have above average exposure to COVID-19. The job satisfaction is unreal- I can save lives without people ever knowing my name. The rock-solid job security doesn't hurt either.


At 22, I lived in an 80 sq foot room in a place with 5 loud roommates, 3 dogs, and a bird who lived on dayshift schedules. My sleep schedule was a wreck. However, I made it a goal of mine to not leave this place until I paid off every penny of my student loans and landlord, who was kind enough to waive my security deposit and provide basic furniture (she wasn't great in other aspects, however). I deprived myself of a lot, but I was able to pay off government loans before the end of the grace period and knocked out personal loans soon after. In addition, I created a rock solid emergency fund. Lastly, I contributed to the employer match in my 403b.



23 is boring. I started to contribute more to my 403(b), a teeny pension (I was an adjunct for a semester), and developed a Roth IRA. I got a place of my own to rent close to work. Same thing at 24, but Im trying to max my accounts out. After the market going up and down due to current events, I can say with confidence that my retirement funds reached and stayed at $50k. I could not be more proud.



Here are some stats. 

Career: Medical Laboratory Scientist

Location: Northeast, HCOL area

Base hourly (Fixed): $26.70/hr now, was $26.18/hr from Jan-Oct 2020

Bonuses/Differentials/Overtime (Variable): $20k-$30k/yr- differentials are the majority of this

Income from adjunct (2020 only): $1,920

Roth IRA, pension, and 403b as of 11/11/2020: $53,630.74

Additional things of value: I own my vehicle and have 6 months of living expenses in my emergency fund- about $18.5k total (using the KBB trade-in value to estimate the worth of my car)

Debt: $0

Expenses: $2.5k-$3k a month. This includes fixed expenses, variable expenses, and saving for my Roth IRA.

After tax savings rate is ~45% for 2020. Im not sure how much that raise will change this number.

FIRE goals: $70k/yr at 3.5%. Healthcare is expensive and I dont want to burden people with my long-term illnesses. I would love to transition to coastFIRE sometime in my 30s and let compound interest take over, if possible.

My future goals include: following my passion for art, mentoring young females in my family, finding a good life partner, having an easier work schedule, and FI

21,"Hit 300k NW. My story as a 27 y.o. female, immigrant, minority, and growing my income from 32k > 150k.",,2704.0,htlk4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/htlk4h/hit_300k_nw_my_story_as_a_27_yo_female_immigrant/,1595097224.0,"I‚Äôve been reading this sub since 2015 and with the encouragement of my partner, finally decided to post. Throwaway so I can share #s and answer your questions.

Background: daughter of two immigrants, I was born outside the U.S. but raised here from a young age. My parents are some of the most disciplined and frugal people I‚Äôve ever met - probably due to growing up poor in rural India. We were low income as I was growing up but my parents worked hard and are solidly middle class now. I got what I needed as a child but rarely anything more. 

College: Luckily I loved school and got good grades. Landed a generous scholarship and went to a small liberal arts school. Thinking I wanted to be a lawyer, I got the equivalent of a poli-sci degree. Graduated at 20 years old, and became the first person in my family to get a college degree. 

Post college: Had a crisis while taking the LSATs and applying to law school. Decided being a lawyer wasn‚Äôt going to be for me and withdrew my applications. 

So at 20, I had a network of 5k, a ‚Äúuseless degree‚Äù and no direction. This was the first time in my life I felt aimless, without school to guide me. But, thanks to my on-campus job in college, I had a few thousand dollars to my name. 

I had the realization that when your parents work manual labor jobs your whole life and haven‚Äôt gone to college, you don‚Äôt get a road map like other kids. I had no idea how the corporate world worked. But I was willing to work hard and learn, because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd learned from my parents. 

Start of my career at 20 years old: 
- Left the suburbs where my family lived and moved to a HCOL city nearby. I got a job as a content writer at a startup paying 32k a year. 
- I was barely scraping by this time and without the help of my partner, I literally wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pay rent. 

Lucky break during this year at the start up: I discovered FIRE and realized how much it aligned with my values, and how much I was already living that lifestyle. My partner and I were already sharing a 500 square foot studio to save money.

From there, my goal became to grow my income and stay frugal (not that I had a choice with my income at this time lol). My partner was 100% on board and to this day, I consider that my luckiest break of all: I met someone whose financial values align with mine. 

Job changes and networth for the next 5 years: 

- Content writer (32k) &gt; contract role doing content (40k) &gt; got converted from contract to full time in marketing dept at the same company (53k). 

These two years were HARD. My budget was strict and had almost 0 discretionary spend. Still sharing the same studio apartment with my partner. But I worked hard to prove my value at work and saved every penny I could. Networth went from that initial 5k to 50k over two years, thanks to lots of stock market growth. 

- Left the company where I was making 52k &gt; to take a contract marketing type role at Microsoft (74k). This move was entirely to get the big name on my resume.

Thanks to four years of scraping by, STILL living in a studio apartment and a really strict budget, I broke 100k at the age of 24. 

Finally started to indulge a little in ‚Äúfun‚Äù purchases like coffee shops and date nights. 

Early 2018:
- Started applying to content marketing roles at FANG companies. I had Microsoft on my resume and a better understanding of what non-tech roles existed at big tech companies.
- After 5 months of rejections, I landed a FANG job with a salary of 130k!! 
- Had to relocate to another state for the job
and it was now mid-2018, and my net worth was just about 150k. 

Moved into a 1-bedroom apartment for the first time. Expenses went up in my new VHCOL area but my salary increase offset that.

Been at the same company for 2+ years now and went from 130k to 150k in total comp thanks to two generous raises and working hard to be a ‚Äútop performer.‚Äù 

Hit a net worth of 300k this week. Having a high income, spending less than 40k a year in a VHCOL area, a generous employer match, and the ‚Äútrump rally‚Äù all contributed.

The last 7 years have felt like a whirlwind. I didn‚Äôt even learn English until I was 5 years old and now I‚Äôm working at a top tech company. 

The events of the last few months made me feel compelled to share my journey and maybe inspire other people on the FIRE journey who are minorities, don‚Äôt come from a secure background or are struggling through the corporate world. I feel INCREDIBLY fortune to be in this position. 

Anyways, thank you for letting me share my story with you all. Ask away if you have questions and I‚Äôll do my best to answer throughout the day.

22,"Just because your path to FI/RE isn't straight and smooth, doesn't mean you shouldn't take that path. Here's my story:",,2700.0,j6x1y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j6x1y8/just_because_your_path_to_fire_isnt_straight_and/,1602097382.0,"Here on /r/financialindependence I read a lot of stories of many people's rather smooth transition from high school to a good college and into an immediately well paying career path that will set them up for life with little worry.  Some of us however have taken more unconventional paths.  

Here's a summarization of my adult working life:

Straight up - I was very unsuccessful financially for the first decade of my adult life.  

In college I was not a hard worker, most of my spare change went to beer, and a serious bout of depression almost flunked me out and took me several extra years to get my grades back up.  I had grown up with helicopter parents that severely limited my social life, so I viewed college as an escape from their grasp and as an excuse to have fun more than a way to get educated and set up my future.  I ended up barely graduated in 2011 with a degree that had been completely neutered by the 2008 financial crisis (Urban Planning).  I had worked intermittently in college during my breaks and also on an on-campus job and was able to pay cash for my first car (a used Toyota Corolla) that I still drive today.  Other than that, I was broke when I graduated.

I didn't get a job straight out of college.  I had an internship opportunity through a family friend that had been rescinded due to slashed budgets.  I had to move back home with my parents to a VLCOL small town where there was no work to be had; I couldn't even land a 3rd shift gas station attendant job.  After 10 months of unemployment and lots of boredom and depression, a chance encounter actually landed me an entry level job in my field: $11/hr conducting surveys for the local planning commission in a MCOL city; a far cry from the standard starting salary of $50k/yr that career path would have afforded me had I been just a few years older but hey, it was a job.

Over the next year I did everything I could to be as frugal as I possible: I lived in a friend's partially finished attic for $100/mo, I biked over driving every chance I could, grocery shopping was only done at Aldi and Walmart, I limited my recreational activities to free events and sports, and my only vacations were either to my parent's house or to visit my sister in another city two hours away.  I managed to save up $4000 that first year and opened up my first Roth IRA.  Very exciting!

The problem is that I realized that I hated my field of work.  The education I received didn't properly set me up to work in this new post-2008 financial and political world.  I didn't like the prospects of my future career, the culture of the workforce, and the fact that our work was continuously blown up by politicians routinely making poor decisions.  I realized that my dream of making utopian cities would never come true.  I grew to hate the city I lived in and the people I interacted with.  I needed a change.

In late 2013 I quit my job on a Friday and by Monday I had packed my car and was off to a new VHCOL city to start over with $3500 in my pocket and no job prospects.  A friend there had offered to let me sleep on the couch and I took him up on it.  Would I ever recommend anyone does this?  No, but in a way I was desperate and still pretty young so I chanced it.  Unfortunately, this VHCOL city also had almost no job prospects in my field, and for the next year I desperately applied to every job I could while taking little side jobs here and there to generate some cash flow.  

By October of 2014, I once again was broke.  Here I was, 26 years old, college educated, and I was sleeping on a couch with no money, no job, no girlfriend, no prospects in life, etc.  I hadn't contributed to my Roth IRA at all in the past two years.  My parents sent me $400 to get gas and an oil change so I could move back home.  The local factory had picked up and they had job openings; my future as a assembly line worker was being solidified.  

On a stroke of sheer luck, I found my drunk neighbor outside one night; he had lost his keys at a bar and was locked out of his home.  I called for a locksmith to come, and I stayed with my neighbor while he waited.  We got to talking and I told him the story I just told above.  He very drunkenly took sympathy and offered me a temporary job in the warehouse he managed for $10/hr.  He was clear that the work would suck and many people didn't last long, but I didn't care.  I was elated and took him up on it immediately.

I busted my ass for the next month working every moment I could and saving every penny.  The company liked me so much that they decided to keep me around. 
 Within two months I was off the couch and was moving in with a friend....into his sunroom.  But it wasn't the couch and it was only $250/mo!  I was able to open up a new bank account with $1000.  I was going places!

The next several years were still tough: I only received small increases in pay, I was passed over for promotions by other more well connected people, and I was still living quite literally in a closet.  Through overtime I was barely crossing the $30k per year mark.  And hanging over all of this was that I was still living in a VHCOL city, so that income did not take me very far.

At the beginning of 2017, the promotion finally came.  My income increased 50% and I was able to move out of the closet and into my own bedroom.  I was able to now start saving money at a good tick.  The problem was that I was so scared of returning to my old financial situation that I kept all of my money in cash.  2008 and all that it did to me and others still scared the fuck out of me.  I had worked so hard for that cash and I was not going to lose it.

2018 comes and my pay increased another 25%, and then that summer I decided to log in to my Vanguard account for the first time in years.  What I found was that I had totally forgotten to invest that $4000 that I had deposited in 2012 and had been sitting in a settlement fund.  The growth over the years meant that that $4000 had turned into $11000, which is great, but I did some calculations and found that had I put it in VTSAX, it would have become ~ $30,000.  I was pissed!

From that day forward, I have been very focused about saving and investing my money.  I found a pretty cheap little apartment for my area ($1000/mo with all utilities included) and I save about 50% of my take home earnings.  Last year (2019) I crossed the $70k income threshold for the first time and I payed off the last of my student loans.  My emergency fund grew to be big enough to cover a full year of expenses which has removed a ton of stress.  I have a separate CD fund set up that will allow me to buy a car either for cash or with the help of a small loan once my trusty Corolla finally dies.  I have been very lucky through the pandemic and have not only maintained my employment but also picked up a side gig.  I expect to cross at least the $85k income threshold this year (2020).  It's still not a ton of money living in a VHCOL city, but I've found little ways to stretch my money further than it should.  Purchasing a home is nowhere in my near future unfortunately, but that's just the way it is right now when the cheapest housing unit of any kind for sale is +$600K.

But what I'm most proud of financially is that for the first time in my life I recently crossed the $100,000 net worth level at the age of 32.  It's hard to believe how far I've come in the last 5 or 6 years from when I was straight up broke.  Index funds are absolute wonders!  At my current pace I expect to become a millionaire by the time I'm 43.  I've faced a lot of failures both internal and external so the prospect of this to me is elating.  I took risks that few would advise, and was willing to take on jobs that many would consider beneath themselves.

I share my experiences because I'm sure like many others I see the stories posted here about the full scholarship magna cum laude software developer that immediately gets a job at Google and will be able to retire at 35 and this can be very discouraging for us more ""average"" folk.  The path isn't easy for most of us, but it is worth it.  Luck can and does play a big role for us all; don't try to hide or avoid it, just embrace it and take advantage of the opportunities that come your way.  I don't know if I will ever fully achieve the Retirement Early part of FIRE, but I am damn proud that I can see the Financial Independence part in my future.",165.0,financialindependence

Backstory:

Started my career in the beginning of 2011 at 22 years old with $9k that I had saved up from working part-time jobs throughout high school/college. My parents supported me financially through college, so that obviously put me at a great place to start out independently upon graduation.

First couple years out of college I made good money and had a lot of fun, but spent a bit more than I was comfortable with (lots of unnecessary eating out, drinking, etc.). I got more serious about the FI mindset in 2014 and split rent with roommates at a cheaper place, so was really able to rein in my spending. Basically continued this for the next few years while slowly earning more and more.

I've always been a fairly frugal person. I'm the guy who never gets sodas at restaurants and only adds guac at Chipotle for special occasions. I track my expenses in Mint religiously. 

I've always pushed a lot of my money into investments (pretax as much as possible, taxable for the rest). It's easy to look back now and say that's a no-brainer, but you can pretty much pick any point in time over the last 8 years and find reasons why people though the markets were overpriced and going to crash. No different than today. Stay the course, it works.

In 2017 I got a new job at a higher position in a large company.  I also discovered that I now had a strong enough skill set that I could do some work on the side as a freelancer.

In 2018 I was lucky to be connected to a few more clients and took on more freelance work. This growth continued in 2019 as I built a stronger freelance portfolio and found more clients. Between my ""day job"" and freelancing I am putting in a huge amount of hours weekly, but I enjoy the freelance work, I like my clients, and it's a lot more productive than sitting around and watching Netflix all the time (which is what I used to do).

In the future, I hope to keep the traction that I've got going in my freelance work, and maybe turn it into a full business. I like my day job, but 9-5 M-F is just not my cup of tea (not to mention the drag of corporate bureaucracy and politics). I have relaxed a little bit to enjoy some lifestyle creep. No longer stress about adding guac for $2, not worried about overpaying for a trendy drink if I'm spending time with friends. I can feel my ""value"" shifting to being focused on ""time"" rather than on ""dollars"" and it's awesome.

**TLDR: Set your plan, stay the course. Be open to opportunities to make more money (by switching jobs or side gigs). Keep your spending in check as best you can.**",502.0,financialindependence
24,My Story: Reaching $250K Net Worth as 27 year old Black Gay Male,,2623.0,i9x3r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9x3r5/my_story_reaching_250k_net_worth_as_27_year_old/,1597448757.0,"As of today‚Äôs market close, I surpassed 250K net worth. It‚Äôs been an arduous journey filled with a lot of suboptimal decisions made along the way but I‚Äôm very excited and blessed to have achieved such a pivotal milestone.  I believe my story is worthwhile sharing and my ultimate goal behind this write-up is to add to the existing collection of stories shared here that detail how FIRE can be achieved despite one‚Äôs background or demographic.

**Trials and Tribulations**  
I grew up in a VHCOL location in a single parent household as my dad died when I was very young. This certainly had an impact on the financial stability of the household. Growing up, my mom leveraged many of the welfare programs such as food stamps and section 8 to help stay afloat. Unfortunately, my mom didn‚Äôt finish high school nor go to college. So not only was she a single parent, but a single parent with limited employment prospects and low income potential. All of this, coupled with a lack of financial literacy, resulted in my mom living paycheck-to-paycheck as she struggled to make ends meet.

**The Inflection Point**  
Growing up, my mom was determined that neither me nor my siblings would replicate her path. She is a shining example of a parent who wants the best for their kids and for their kids to live a better life than they did. From young, my mother always emphasized the importance of education and aspiring to greatness. I am eternally thankful to my mom for guiding me through my childhood and keeping me on the right path. My mom never had to beat these concepts into my head nor stay on top of me ‚Äî I just ‚Äúgot it‚Äù very early on. I made good marks throughout primary and secondary school; got into my dream school on a full ride scholarship, where I continued to make good marks, and became the first person in my family to go to ‚Äî and graduate from ‚Äî college (a Top 10 Liberal Arts college); and hustled my ass off senior year of college to ensure that I had a full-time job lined up after graduation. 

**The Journey**  
Before getting into my career details, I want to first acknowledge the fortune I had of graduating in 2014 ‚Äî a time where the economy was healthily growing and long removed from the Great Recession and where the job market was bustling. These two factors certainly played a huge role in my ability to secure a job during the spring of senior year of college. I started my career at 22 where I worked at a small analytics firm. I had a quantitative major in college so that aided in me securing an entry level role at this analytics firm (shocking, I know). I had a decent time where I stayed for \~4 years and was promoted several times. After losing interest, I hopped jobs twice more before landing at my current company where I work in a hybrid analytics and consulting role. I truly enjoy my current role much more than any of my previous roles. However, the most jarring lesson in my career movement is how much my compensation has grown with external moves. At the end of my final year at my first company I made \~$96k. At my second employer I made $115k. At my current employer, I‚Äôve made \~$180k so far (annualized) ‚Äî and I still have one more bonus due before year‚Äôs end which will push me to about $190k-$195k total compensation. I would have ***never*** gotten this far this fast had I been at my first or second employer. I‚Äôm aspiring to break through $200k compensation next year, which should be achievable if the economy doesn‚Äôt crumble again.

**Current Financial Situation**  
As mentioned in the title, [my current net worth is $250K](https://imgur.com/p1XxQ9y). Since the start of my career I‚Äôve been living at home, so that definitely has played a major role in my ability to save aggressively while living in a VHCOL. Here‚Äôs some context behind my net worth:

* 401ks are in a mix of VFIAX and VIIIX; the rest of my net worth is in VTSAX
* 100% of my Roth 401k is funded via Mega Backdoor (no direct contributions)
* [I didn‚Äôt start investing in my taxable brokerage or maxing out my 401k, IRA, and HSA until 2019](https://imgur.com/jBSgu2x)
* Net worth composition: 47% taxable; 30% tax-deferred (traditional 401k); 22% tax free (Roth 401k/IRA, HSA); <1% risk stock (triple-leveraged ETFs)

**Mistakes Made**  
Firstly, I didn‚Äôt start investing (excl. 401k) until 2019 despite starting my career in 2014. In the early stages of my career, I was primarily saving cash as my goal at the time was to save for a down payment for a house for my late twenties/early thirties. In hindsight, even with that goal, I should‚Äôve still been active in the stock market as my time horizon was far enough out (8+ years). Between June 2014 and February 2019 ‚Äî the time I was out of the market ‚Äî [the S&P500 grew \~46% with dividends reinvested and accounting for inflation](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/). As I didn‚Äôt start investing until March 2019, I missed out on some decent gains. My portfolio would probably be $100k higher (give or take) had I been in the market consistently since 2014.

Secondly, I didn‚Äôt max out my 401k, IRA, and HSA until 2019. Looking back at [my salary history](https://imgur.com/vAap6l3), I could‚Äôve been maxing these accounts out as early as 2015. But because I was so laser focused on saving for a down payment and lacked financial literacy, I ignorantly chose to heavy up on cash. This suboptimal move costed me thousands of dollars in lost tax savings. The only silver lining in all of this is that nearly half of my portfolio is in a taxable brokerage account ‚Äî so that means I can easily access funds without having to entertain roundabout ways to access my money (e.g. 72t, conversion ladders).

**Things that Didn‚Äôt Prove True for Me**  
From youth to adulthood, I‚Äôve been regularly told (e.g. family, the media) that ‚Äúas a black man, you (will) have to work twice as hard in life.‚Äù But when I reflect on my life-to-date, I never felt this way. I just always knew I had to work hard, period. It was never a matter of working 2x or 3x as hard to achieve success. Early on, my mom instilled in me the confidence that if I dreamed big and worked hard, then I could achieve my goals. I have proved ‚Äî and continue to prove ‚Äî this to myself time and time again. Objectively, I can say that neither my race nor sexuality have been impediments to my success and ability to achieve at any point in my life. My drive, vision, and motivation have always been, and will continue to be, the basis of my achievements.

**Future Goals**  
I do NOT want to retire too early ‚Äî I‚Äôm eying 55 as I truly do enjoy what I do work work and feel like I have a few more decades left in me, but also not trying to work into my late 50s or 60s. Short-term, I‚Äôm looking to hit $500K net worth by 30. I acknowledge that this is super aggressive but if things go business as usual (e.g. the stock market doesn‚Äôt go to shit) and my income remains at the level it is now, I‚Äôm confident that I can hit this target. Long-term, I‚Äôm targeting $5M-$10M net worth by 55. I acknowledge that this net worth target is aggressive and probably puts me more into baby fatFIRE territory. The two main reasons behind this aggressive target are (1) I want to live an extremely comfortable life in my retirement and don‚Äôt want to feel restricted and (2) I‚Äôm at the forefront of creating generational wealth for my family, which is currently nonexistent. I want to be able to leave millions (ideally) to my future kids (if I decide to have kids) or to my siblings and/or their kids. I want to keep the train running and I don‚Äôt want it to stop with me. 

Aside from myself, I‚Äôm looking to set my youngest sibling up for success early on. I‚Äôve opened a 529 account currently set up for $1,200/year contributions for the next 5-7 years. Again, if the market acts business as usual, this should put the account somewhere in the ball park of $10k, give or take (unfortunately, I know this is just a drop in the bucket relative to how much more expensive college will be 5-10 years from now *sigh*). Additionally, I want to contribute to the youth ‚Äî particularly black youth. Growing up in predominantly black, low income neighborhoods and now having ‚Äúmade it,‚Äù I know that I wasn‚Äôt the only black kid with a hard upbringing and a dream for a better life. There are many black youth out there who are smart, talented, and more than capable but just don‚Äôt have the resources or opportunities to optimize their success. There are two organizations in particular that align with this passion of mine that I have been involved in over the last decade through acts of volunteering, mentorship, and donations. I aspire to continue this for the rest of my life and leave a hefty portion of my net worth to these organizations upon my passing.

**Realizations**  
As I end, I want to share some foundational realizations I‚Äôve made over the years, and especially more recently:

* This journey isn‚Äôt a competition, thus I don‚Äôt have any competition. I often see comments like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing better than X% of the USA, the world, or your demographic‚Äù and they mean absolute nothing to me. My goals are *my* goals ‚Äî they‚Äôre not impacted or influenced by others, regardless if I‚Äôm at the bottom or top of the pack for my demographic.

I think of success as a pie chart: while one slice of the pie chart may account for a large percentage of the pie (e.g. work ethic), there are still multiple slices that make up the rest of the pie chart: dreams, visions, support system, timing, college, network, luck, etc.",595.0,financialindependence

Gets big crypto windfall at the height of his career. Now feels like his job is pointless and trying to figure out life. Boo hoo feel bad for him. I'm such an idiot.*

I'll keep this quick(ish) for all of us short attention span havers. I'm 35 years old, I have a career in a field where I get to be a creator (sort of a YouTuber, sort of an artist, sort of a ""travel guide"", sort of a filmmaker, sort of an on-camera personality, BUT I have bosses telling me the kind of stuff to make). I **was** obsessed with this job/industry for the better part of a decade. For many years I got lots of travel, nice hotels shooting in foreign locations, eating nice dinners and lots of admiration and respect from peers and colleagues. I watched my income grow from mid $30k to literally 10x that over the span of 7 years. And, fortunately, I never acquired a taste for expensive things (save for some industry gear). So that meant I was saving a LOT of my income yearly. Well on my way to FI/FatFI before I even knew about this philosophy of investing.

In 2014, I discovered bitcoin. Please, please. I know that many here think bitcoin in a huge speculative gamble and after riding through a major UP and DOWN, you are preaching to the choir. Regardless, I love the idea of it and fell deep down the rabbit hole‚Äì reading and watching every bit of content I could find. Over the span of a year and a half I put ALMOST everything I saved into it‚Äì figuring my earnings would set me back ahead even if it tanks. (Again, I crazy/foolish I **know).** Long story short, the bull run hits in 2017, and I can't fucking believe it. Over the course of 6 months, hands shaking, I cashed out (after tax) about 2.8 million. I didn't even sell at the top.

Around this time, I was trying to learn how to ""live off the interest"", get off that crazy rollercoaster, invest **RESPONSIBLY‚Äì** I discovered FIRE, and was like ""holy shit"" this is it! I jammed everything into a simple three fund index-based portfolio of US Equity/Foreign Equity/Bonds.

I kept working (way less) for almost 2 years after that, but everything mentally changed. Suddenly, once the monetary excitement was stripped from doing work, all the other pluses felt...dull. Like, I can get ""nice hotels"", ""lots of travel"", ""good dinners"" etc... without a job now.

I hit 3.5 million this year and have been taking a break completely from work for 9 months now. Traveling, contemplating, philosophizing, visiting friends, leaning into hobbies/pastimes and honestly trying to figure out what my life means to myself and others now that at a 3.8% SWR, after tax, I can **SPEND/DONATE** $10,000/month forever. That's my needs, wants and then some. Why would I do anything that a boss/client/manager wants me to do when...I don't have to?

I'm at the same mental place a LOT of people get to when they hit their number. The problem is two-fold, One, I used to looove my job and it was a source of lots of excitement in my life. Hard to recreate that with just money, but I also don't feel like doing the work it takes just to get the high status stuff. Two, I don't feel like I deserve this **at all** because I got here earlier with a lucky bet on crypto. I would have definitely gotten here, but maybe in my 40s and I would have felt I actually earned it.

Basically, it feels like I used a cheat code on my life and now I'm not sure how to make it fun again. And don't feel like I ""deserve"" to FIRE. This is such an unrelatable problem, but I thought this nonjudgemental community might have some insights or nuggets of wisdom.",793.0,financialindependence

Just wanted to write a quick update because people have been asking for FI people to post their statuses during all this and perhaps this will be therapeutic. It definitely sucks to lose that much (in a month!). And it will continue to suck as/if the market goes down. Here's what I've done to slow the bleeding:

* Moved to a low cost of living country.

* Lowered my ~~monthly~~ yearly burn rate to 1.2% of my CURRENT (after crash) portfolio. This is necessities and a little teeny tiny tiny bit of recreation/restaurant. Will get better at cooking and most things I like to do cost little money.
* Will continue to live here and keep this withdrawal rate until that withdrawal rate reaches 1% (or in other words until the markets recover 20% (beyond my withdrawals). Then, I'll raise my withdrawals to 2% which will effectively double my current conservative budget.
* Could be months, could be years. I'm young, single and flexible as fuck, so I'd be silly to not take advantage of those things to protect my future self's retirement.
* My pre-FI career is a bit distant after taking a couple years off, but I'm going to seek out some projects if I can get them as people get back to work so that I'm further reducing withdrawals, ideally to zero and, if I'm lucky enough, buy more equities as the markets are depressed.

A coworker, probably in her late 40‚Äôs, asking another coworker about the same age, how to transfer all her stock to bonds on the 401k website. The second coworker then describes click by click how to do it, while also getting rather angry at her (as a friend) for not doing it earlier as she had done. 

‚ÄúYOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF STOCKS NOW‚Äù she almost yelled. 

I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. The market at that point was down around 20%?  And here this person was about to eliminate a substantial amount of what could potentially be her life‚Äôs savings.  And her friend presumably had already done the same. 

The more I thought about it, the more depressing it got.  I realized they could have possibly done the same thing a number of times in the past.  Each time they could have exited the downturn with much less than they‚Äôd started with. If they were still in stocks at this point, they must buy back into stocks at some point after the carnage.  And all this essentially represents how they understand the markets, and how they believe one should invest.  And it made me realize how scared someone like that must be about their investments and retirement, to think that at any time, the markets could tank and you simply just loose years of savings because of it, nothing you can do about it.  

Anyways, for a bit I attributed this to them simply not being that bright.  But I began to think, what if I didn‚Äôt have groups like these?  What if I didn‚Äôt have smarter people crunching the numbers, running the projections, doing unbiased research (hopefully lol), that I so easily get to benefit from?

[My first post - a 1 year in reflection + FIRE story](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b2bfko/fire_1_year_in_a_few_reflections/)

[And my 2 year follow up here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/etgc2q/fire_2_years_in_a_few_more_reflections/)

I‚Äôm a patient person, a future-oriented person, and these characteristics helped me to persist in the long-term planning I did when I was working towards FI/RE. It helped me hold on to my investment in crypto as it soared (Stick to your plan, man: I took some profits, which is how I jumped the queue to FIRE earlier than expected and with more than I needed, though I was heavy on the FI/RE path before that). 

I am also a semi-rational person (I think), who has played out a number of scenarios in my head many times. In fact ‚Äì I had to do that to feel confident to retire in the first place. What if ____ (fill in catastrophic thing) happens?‚Ä¶ each time I figured out how I would survive and most of the survival plans fell out to: keep cool and sit tight (a couple of them included ‚Äúand go back to work.‚Äù) Considering how the stock market and economy in general are cyclical, I had gone through the ‚Äúwhat do you do when there is a crash and your net worth drops significantly?‚Äù (note the crash part is not ‚Äúif‚Äù, but ‚Äúwhen‚Äù). The answer, as previously mentioned, was ‚Äúsit on the porch and watch your sunflowers grow.‚Äù  

There was a conversation in (I think) one of my posts last year where after the market had dropped a small amount I mentioned I had just chilled through it (while others flipped out and panic-sold and were then kicking themselves) and someone on here snarkily replied ‚Äúwell, wait until you see a REAL drop, then we will see what you do!‚Äù 

Well Snarko VonSnarkington, this post is for you. 

As you might recall, the month of March was brutal, with many days showing huge losses in the stock markets. Not only did the market drop precipitously but my historically uncorrelated asset bitcoin shit the bed as well (a universal rush to cash?) leaving me just over $1M poorer net-worth-wise. 

My portfolio consists of real estate (my old house that I now rent out), index funds, and bitcoin. I outright own my current house (sold my bond funds to buy the house) and a piece of shit truck that I love. I also own a cat free and clear. 

So what did I do as my portfolio took a double barreled shotgun to the face?!?!? Not a goddamn thing. Ok, that‚Äôs a lie. I loss-harvested 90k worth of index funds which have since recovered and then some. I held tight. I held strong. I built shelves for my workshop out of salvaged lumber. 

Psychologically I have to say I felt off ‚Äì it was not fun, and it was not Zen (though I tried brother, I tried). I had to argue with myself ‚Äúwell, this is one of those situations that test your mettle, meboyo‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚Äúwow, how is this going to play out‚Ä¶ nervous‚Ä¶ yuck‚Ä¶‚Äù but even though I experienced emotions, there was never even the option in my mind to sell in order to protect capital. It never appealed to me as a wise option and I had no compulsion to do so. For years I have made an informed decision to commit to this strategy I believe in, and damnit I am going to stick by it. I own my house. I know how to cook. I have health insurance and a rainy-day fund. I am retired, by design, because I stick to the plan until it no longer makes any sense ‚Äì and this was a case where it looked like things were going to be ok (maybe it will take 3 years, but ok nonetheless). I had no idea we would see a stock/crypto recovery so quickly. 

By the end of this August when I updated my monthly spreadsheet, I had crossed back above where I was just before the crash. As of last week  my net worth is 10% higher than it was before the crash.  I also used the confusion in the marketplace in April to buy a beautiful old house to live in (and it has a huge detached workshop!) in a new, lower COL city (with cash, at a discount).

Who the hell knows what happens next with this economy, politics, health, meteors, and the old Gods of Cthulu, but I‚Äôve got one ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù under my belt now and I feel like I played it well by not playing at all. If anyone is looking for me, I‚Äôm out back in the workshop, making smoke and dust and a general mess as I teach myself woodworking and metalworking to enhance my primitive art constructs. 

Feel free to ask any questions, and when shit gets weird, remember to breathe.

I have been running extra hard in the rat race for far too many years (even though some would call me young).  I worked very hard, even working to support myself through college and the grad school. I neglected my health, my friends, and my family along the way.  The COVID quarantine was a wakeup call for me.  It gave me a taste of what life would be like when I didn't have to commute across the city to sit in an office for certain prescribed hours each week.  I'm hooked and I can't go back.

The past several years, I house-hacked and side-hustled my way to FU money and to be honest it came so much faster than I anticipated.  FU money in hand, I've realized that I can't stay in my day job anymore.  I need to be free to do my own thing.  In the next 3-6 months, I'm moving from my M/HCOL city to a much smaller LCOL city near the water.  I just put a cash offer on a house and I hope it gets accepted.  It's a small house that needs work but it's in a safe location near downtown, it's livable, and most importantly in my budget.  I plan on renting out the house I currently own which should cover it's mortgage and give me some cash flow.

Recently, I paid cash for a 4 year old economy car with 48k miles on it which should last me many years so my expenses are going to be very low.  I am looking forward to waking up in the morning, working out, then cooking a healthy breakfast before tackling some home improvement projects in between working for clients at my own work from home business.  When I land a new client, I am going to treat myself with lunch and a couple of beers at my local joint.  Occasionally I'm going to wake up on a Tuesday morning and go to the beach and chill all day because I can.

And I'm going to focus less on myself and more on the people I care about.  I'm not waiting any more.  I'm going to do this now while I can.  I've had friends die in their 20s and relatives live to over 100. You never know when it's the last time you'll ever see someone again.  I'm going to surprise my sister with tickets to her favorite musical artist and take her to a show.  I'm going to visit my old college buddy who is married with a kid and have a few beers.  And I'm going to help my dad restore the classic car he bought which is very similar to his first new car.  I still have my car from high school though it hasn't run in years.  Maybe I can get that fixed up and my dad and I can take our cars to a car show together.

I don't want to stop working.  I have no desire to ever fully retire.  I think as humans, we crave progress.  And progress comes from work.  It's not just satisfying, it's a damn privilege to be able to work.  But you have to work on something that you're passionate about.  I want to invent things.  I want to create things.  I want to design things.  I want to build things.  And most importantly, I want to teach and inspire people to do great things of their own.

So of course, saving and investing became a big part of my life. Earlier this year however, something happened in my life and I decided to also start taking care of myself. Went on a diet, started exercising and have so far lost about 30 lbs.

I can now do 5K runs and I don't even feel it. It's nothing now. My goal is to work up to doing half marathons. Anyway, I recently started reflecting on what freedom really means to me. Freedom is not merely being able to give your stupid desk job the finger, or having the ability to spend your time as you wish thanks to material wealth accumulation.

Freedom is thinking about what you'd really like to achieve in life, and then going for it without fear, regret or what anyone else thinks. Freedom isn't having the option to eat cheeseburgers and doritos all the time, even though it technically is. The problem with doing so is that it separates you from the best version of yourself, and the best version of yourself is the freest form of yourself. Think about it:

The best version of yourself is the one YOU want to become. Want to be strong, athletic and have a nice body? Figure out what you need to do to get there. Take advice from guys who have what you want, replicate what they're doing, and eventually refine it such that it works better for you. This can only be done through self-discipline. Self-discipline = freedom, as Jocko Willink puts it.

FIRE is ultimately a mindset. Besides, as Charlie Munger once said: ""life is more than being shrewd at passive wealth accumulation"". Don't get me wrong, keep saving, folks. Just make sure you focus on maximizing your freedom in other areas of life as well. Imagine how freeing it is to be able to run long distances and not have to worry. You can just do it. It takes you places. You see things, scenery, people. You challenge yourself and it makes you feel good afterwards. THAT is true freedom.

At first, I was obsessed with it. I read all the blogs, tried all the super-frugal tips, made plenty of excel spreadsheet projections, checked my investment balance daily, etc. But after a while, it became repetitive and my interest waned. There really wasn't much to this whole FIRE thing. But no matter how boring or repetitive the content on this sub was, I checked it every day because my thoughts always drifted back to FIRE.

FIRE was hope for me. Every day I woke up and as my consciousness miraculously reconstituted itself and I recalled who I was, where I was, and what I'd soon be doing with this precious and limited gift of life I'd once again been granted, there was a 5 out of 7 chance my first thought would be ""*Oh god...not another one of these...*"" My job was miserable, but the people who set the salary knew it was miserable and paid appropriately high amounts in order to keep some poor schmuck doing it. The dominant, rational part of me rejected changing careers or fields. *Maximizing your earnings is the most efficient way to minimize your career length. You can endure this!* So whenever work became too much to bear, I always found myself fantasizing about FIRE. The day I could buy my freedom. The day I would own myself.

Somehow I made it six years on pure fumes and cynicism. Looking back, I'm not sure how I did it. I'd always planned to make a ""I just RE'd!"" post here and get told to go fuck myself. But the moment I retired I just allowed myself to be swept up by life. I let my whims guide me for the first time in over a decade, rather than carefully rationing out available time. I started doing things I ""didn't have time for"" before. I started writing for fun, I paid more attention to relationships I'd been neglecting, I played the same video game 3 times through back to back just because I wanted to, I went down wikipedia rabbit holes for hours, I and a friend became obsessed with a board game and sunk over 100 hours into it (and counting), etc etc.

Today was the first time since I RE'd two months ago that I remembered that I used to be really into FIRE. *Used to*. As soon as my career was out of the picture and my hope was realized, I had no further reason to fantasize - I was living it. Upon returning to this sub and browsing through these familiar-looking threads, I found they held no appeal to me. If anything, they make me feel uneasy. They remind me of a bleaker time.

I'm not sure if I made a mistake. Maybe I'd have been better off on the whole if I'd taken a lower-paid, less miserable job. Maybe it would've made those years easier to bear.

* I did negotiate away the things I hated about my job before, so I don't expect to hate it now.  I told my boss I was expecting to work maybe 3-5 years.

* I can work from home, which is ideal.  My industry is not directly affected by covid-19, although it does depend on consumption in general.  I expect job security for as long as I want to remain.

* I'm very risk tolerant when it comes to the market, so I'm hardly phased at the loss of value.  I'm not even certain it'll come back at all.

* I have very little confidence that anyone knows what the world will even look like in 20 years.  For this reason I see little point in stressing about it.  We'll roll with things as they evolve.  I've been poor before and I'm not afraid of it.

* I'll go back to maxing my 401K, HSA/etc, but I'm not going to save aggressively like before.  Instead I'm going to travel to some exotic places (assuming they ever fly a plane again), and buy myself some very nice toys.  I mainly just want to avoid selling in this market, in case it ever springs back.",225.0,financialindependence
37,Don't forget to flex your FI leverage before you RE!,,2165.0,ex9eo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ex9eo4/dont_forget_to_flex_your_fi_leverage_before_you_re/,1580577844.0,"Just wanted to share this to prevent others from making the same mistake I very nearly did.

I was hesitant to pull the RE trigger, but after I hit my third FI stretch goal, it seemed like now or never. So I sent in a resignation email and figured I was done!

However, instead of immediately accepting it, my company asked if there was anything that would make me stay. Given that I was FI, I shot for the moon: work part-time from home, and offload the most annoying responsibilities that I wouldn't have time for anymore. They actually said yes, and now I have a relaxed and enjoyable role that allows me to feel half-retired with time for what I want to do in life, while still earning well and building up towards a comfier FIRE.

So when you hit FI, don't forget you have a lot of leverage with no risk, and you might as well try to take advantage of it before you RE! My experiences at jobs has always been surprise at how often someone will say ""yes"", so consider (nicely) explaining the role/commitment isn't for you, and asking if you can carve out a special role to stay on, if this is interesting to you.

As a 26 y/o who has been on the path for 5 years now I wanted to provide some tips for younger people as they begin this journey. I don't have the experience of people who have FIRE'd per se, but I think I can help explain what worked for me. 

1. Learns the basics

Personal finance and investing is an awesome thing to get into because you can dig as deep into it as you want or stay at the surface level. There is a reason why some of the smartest investing minds in the world (Warren Buffett) read for hours on end. The finance world evolves, markets change, and the way people behave with money moves around. With that being said, you need to learn the basics. What are the basics?

‚ÄúSpend less than you make, invest the difference‚Äù

Spend ‚Äì Create a budget. Fixed expenses and then fun money. 

Make ‚Äì Get a job that allows you to save a little bit of cash

Invest ‚Äì Dollar Cost Average, 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage account, withdrawal rates. 

It will be easy to go down a rabbit hole when reading about personal finance to the point where it might even intimidate you. Learn the basics and get started. There are plenty of free online resources that will help you understand best practices like which % of your budget towards certain items and how to invest. You have some time to iron out the details. The worst thing you can do is not start. 

2. Keep it simple: Index Funds

Index funds. Index Funds. Index Funds. 

I don‚Äôt know how else to say this but I would recommend you start off with index funds. I know it isn‚Äôt what /r/stocks or /r/wallstreetbets is going to tell you but index funds will allow you to get a piece of the pie without the risk of individual stocks. The worst thing that could happen to you is you throw a grand in a stock based on a tip on Reddit and you get wiped out to the point where you don‚Äôt even want to invest in the market anymore. 

Hey competitiveduck, that is great but how do I avoid the FOMO of all these tech gains?

Understand that cycles happen. ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered‚Äù. Look into the top 10 companies by market cap for each decade. Companies come and go. I am not anti-stock at all. I recommend that people play around with stocks to avoid FOMO but only once they have enough in index funds to where compound interest takes over. I didn‚Äôt buy a single share of stock until I had >100k invested in index funds and even now it is a small % of my larger portfolio.

3. Get the money

Get the money. You have to be selfish in your career at this point when your expenses are fairly low and you don‚Äôt have the responsibilities of a family. Change cities, change jobs, change companies. Get money. If you are all about starting a low-level job in a company with the idea that in 30 years you might be the CEO great, but there is only 1 CEO job for a reason. Maximize earnings in your 20s as much as you can, invest, and wait. If you don‚Äôt believe me, look up videos or pictures of what happens at 65 based on when you start investing. The difference in net worth is staggering. Get money. 

4. It easiest to compare yourself to others post-college

I‚Äôm not sure there will ever be a time in your life where it is easiest to feel bad about yourself than right after college. You go from everybody playing the same game in college to now everybody is in separate leagues and playing a different sport. You have a friend in law school in debt up to their ass, you have a friend crushing it at Google, you have a friend struggling to figure things out and there might be you just hoping to get enough money for guac at Chipotle. Understand that you don‚Äôt need to be anywhere else than where YOU think you need to be. Life tends to even itself out. 

‚ÄúComparison is the thief of joy‚Äù

5. Keep in touch with friends and take care of your body 

To echo on the last point, good friends are hard to come by the older you get. Try and keep in touch with them as much as possible and plan trips to see them. Some of my best friends still are my college friends. Use them as a base but don‚Äôt be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and explore new people. 

In regard to staying in shape, there is no sense in retiring early if your body isn‚Äôt able to do things you want to do. Plain and simple. 

6. Do what works for you, not what works in a spreadsheet

You are going to hear about all the ways you can tinker with your investments or take on debt and theoretically it works in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets aren‚Äôt rooted in reality. Some of these include how it is easier to put less than 20% down on a house because interest rates are so low and invest the difference, or how you should invest 80% of your paycheck to tap into investing. Morgan Housel has a way of investing and I think it is great in that you should invest in a way that ‚Äúhelps you sleep at night‚Äù and in a way that you can do it consistently for decades. Do what works for you. 

7. This isn‚Äôt a get rich quick scheme

Understand the game that you are playing. Investing Twitter and TV networks react to daily moves in the market. You aren‚Äôt in it for the short term, you are in it for the long term. If you are in your early 20‚Äôs you probably have a 30-40-year time horizon. Think of all the crazy world events that have happened in the last 30-40 years alone. COVID, 08 Financial Crisis, Iraq War, 9/11, Dot Com Crash, and then the 1987 Market Crash. All of those ‚Äúworld is ending‚Äù type events have led to a 9.42% average return before inflation. To tap into the power of compound interest you need to stay in the market for a long period of time.

‚ÄúInterrupting a favorable power law is the worst mistake you can make as an investor.‚Äù ‚Äì Naval

8. Read the top posts on this subreddit but be aware of survivorship bias 

The fact that you are in this subreddit is a great start. Use the resources in the wiki to learn about investment options and what works for other people. Learn about people who have achieved FIRE and how they got there. Most of the time it is a bumpy road with kids, large one-off expenses, buying a house, changing careers, etc. Like the stock market, it is rarely a smooth ride. However, there is a lot of survivorship bias in here about people who have achieved FIRE. For every person who has achieved it, there are probably 10 who have given up, ruined a relationship, or became miserable due to extreme saving. Please understand that this is a grind and if you aren‚Äôt happy now with the hopes of being happy 30 years ago, I‚Äôd advise you to take a step back and read the below post. It is essential reading.

39,FI on my birthday!,,2141.0,gkpoom,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gkpoom/fi_on_my_birthday/,1589608885.0,"I did it today.  On my 47th birthday, I reached $3 million in cash & investments, a paid off house & 2 cars.  I have reached my FI target of $100k @ 3.3% SWR.   I knew it was going to be close with the markets, payday, and my company's equity coming in today.

Plan is to FIRE in 3 months.  $3 million was a symbolic number, I could have FIREd 2 months ago at $2.95 million and lived pretty much the same life.  However, I am getting another \~$70k in equity in 3 months and would like a bit of a buffer especially with the volatile markets.  Also, the plan was to take a nice trip to Europe in August - I don't see that happening.

It is crazy, I know of many people who are laid off, working reduced hours, worried about their job or tapping into debt.  And I am making plans to quit working.

Mega edit:

**Asset allocation**

Cash & short term investments: 25% (increased 10% from equities due to C19)

Employer's Equity: 10%

Equity ETFs: 45% (down 10% - sold in early march, will buy back in later)  

Bond ETFs: 10%

Crypto: 10%

Please bring on the flames for timing the market, but I sold early-ish, it helps me sleep at night, and right now I am trying to be more conservative vs. aggressive.  

The crypto is a flyer.  I bought casino level bitcoin in 2012 at $18, then sold a bunch when it went up to $150.  Then bought a bunch more at $1000, and have been selling little bits for a few years.  Total investment: $45k, total value sold and still held: $500k.  I would like to sell more, but it has a capital gains tax liability, so FIRE with no income next year would help reduce taxes.

Hello everyone, I've been following this subreddit for almost 2 years and recently hit a milestone I wouldn't have reached this early if it wasn't for all of you. I wanted to give my thanks, as well as show you how I ended up where I am for anyone interested in reading. 

Current financial breakdown:

- Investment/Retirement Accounts:$78,736.47

2016 ($14k NW end of year) 

[June]¬† - Just graduated from highschool and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. With college application deadlines coming to an end very soon, and having my teachers, guidance counselors, and parents rush me to make up my mind, I randomly decided to take an accounting major in college because I heard it was in demand. 

[September] - Began my first year of college as well as maintaining 30+ hours at the grocery store I was working at throughout highschool. 

2017 ($31k NW end of year) 

[February] - First semester of college was coming to an end and I was completely miserable. The work was not difficult, the load was not too much for me, but deep in my stomach it just felt so wrong. I knew it wasn't for me and I began showing symptoms of depression because of it that even my close friends began to notice 

[April] - After 2 more months of feeling unmotivated and depressed I decided to pull the plug and drop out. I had no plan B, it was a spur of the moment decision and it felt like the 1000lbs I was carrying on my shoulders was finally gone. 

[June] - Spent the last 2 months working at the grocery store full time and my parents were fed up. We we're arguing every day because of my decision to drop out and after a heated argument they kicked me out the house at 19 years old. 

[July] - Spent 2 weeks with a friend while looking for a place. Ended up finding a basement apartment for cheap and moved in. I knew the minimum wage grocery store job wasn't going to cut it so I found an ad for a construction labourer position paying slightly higher ($35k/yr) and got hired. I spent the rest of the year slaving away and saving every penny I could. I was living VERY cheaply 

2018 ($46k NW end of year) 

(June) - After almost a year of working my ass off, starting earlier then everyone, staying later then everyone, coming in on the weekends to sweep and clean up, the company owner began to be very fond of me and gave me the position of Lead Labourer. This new position almost doubled my income, putting me at $60k/yr. Although the massive pay increase tempted me to splurge, I continued living as if I was still making $35k, and dumped all the extra money into my investment accounts. 

2019 ($72k NW end of year) 

(January - December) - This year not much changed. I was working the same job and still living in the same basement apartment alone. I continued living extremely frugally and was focusing on adding as much money to my investment accounts as possible, even if that meant sacrificing things I really wanted. 

2020 (101K NW end of year) 

(March) - Bought a car for $11k as a birthday gift to myself as I was tired of taking the bus. 

(April) - COVID hit, but thankfully I was able to continue working, most weeks actually working more hours then usual. 

(September) Been working consistently the whole year with no breaks or shutting down due to the virus. The same company owner that gave me a promotion in 2018 asked me if I'd like to train to become a crane operator and I gladly accepted. My wage will remain the same, but once I'm fully certified in about 3 - 4 years I can expect $120k/yr. 

(December) - Just deposited the cheque that puts me at $101k NW! Thank you all for the motivation!",303.0,financialindependence
42,[Milestone] My path to $750K NW as a 27F non-engineer,,2086.0,k8rmgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8rmgt/milestone_my_path_to_750k_nw_as_a_27f_nonengineer/,1607381516.0,"Hi all - I was very hesitant about making this post because (a) it felt braggy, and (b) I‚Äôm wary of having too much personal info, even if anonymous, out there on the internet.

But what pushed me do it was seeing yet another casually sexist comment on /r/personalfinance about girlfriends taking your money. I‚Äôm tired of generalizations (especially in places where the demographics skew male, like finance subreddits) about women being obstacles to a man‚Äôs FI journey at best, or high-maintenance gold-diggers at worst. So I feel obligated to be a visible example of a FI-minded woman, and to add another female voice to the FI conversation.

**TL,DR:**

* Super fortunate in many ways. Graduated debt-free from a top school
* Investment banking ‚Üí tech (but non-engineer)
* \>60% savings rate in a VVHCOL city - live comfortably but intentional about spending
* 5 years after graduation: $750K net worth (\~$300K in post-tax Roth retirement accounts), and total annual comp of \~$275K (excl equity)
* Net worth growth came both from increasing income (switching companies, getting promoted) and from healthy investment returns throughout

[Summary table of income and net worth over time](https://imgur.com/a/FzeTRlZ)

*Note that the years aren‚Äôt totally representative of my actual annual incomes because job transitions and promotions have tended to happen in the middle of year.*

***My story***

* **I was super lucky, in a lot of ways**. I had a middle-class upbringing but my immigrant parents both worked full-time and taught me the value of education and of saving money early on. We always spent below our means.
* **My upbringing and debt-free education = single biggest driver of my financial success thus far.** My parents also paid for my college education so I graduated debt-free from a top university (one of Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford). I amassed a small starting stash of \~$20K by graduation from working paid internships during every college summer (and investing my savings).
* **I started my career in investment banking, then transitioned into corporate strategy at tech companies**. Initially I took a pay cut in leaving finance, but have since grown my income comfortably - and it was worth it solely for the higher quality of life (i.e. not working 80 hours/week in a soul-crushing grind, surrounded by very rich yet deeply unhappy people, adding little discernible value to society).
* **I currently live very comfortably in a VHCOL city**. I eat well, take plenty of vacations, rent a nice apartment, buy myself small luxuries, etc. - but am intentional about spending my money where I feel it most improves my wellbeing.
* **My savings rate is currently >60%**, which includes maxing out retirement contributions. I acknowledge this is also only possible because I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt have any dependents yet (my boyfriend is a software engineer and does fine, though I‚Äôm proud my income/NW are higher than his) - if I have kids in this city in the near future, my expenses will definitely skyrocket.

***On investing***

* Investing has been a major driver of my net worth growth: **\~$275K of the $750K NW is from investment gains made over the last 5 years.**
* I‚Äôve invested all of my extra money (excluding 6 months emergency savings / small amount in checking) since I was in high school.
* Passive investing is objectively the best approach for the vast majority of people. About ‚Öî of my net worth is passively invested in diversified low-fee index funds / ETFs.
* However, I enjoy active investing and doing the research, so **about ‚Öì of my NW is invested in individual stocks**. My actively invested portfolio has made substantial returns over the last 5 years thanks to several investments that have doubled, tripled, up to 9x‚Äôd - like NVDA, NVCR, SQ, TWLO, CRM, etc. Given that I‚Äôm young and have a very long investing horizon, I‚Äôm okay with having a somewhat higher level of risk in my portfolio from these individual stocks.
* **I also basically never sell my investments** \- have never tried to time the market, never sold because I thought it was about to crash, etc. It‚Äôs worked out pretty well for me, with my 5Y annualized return beating all market indices in the same time period - time will tell if that‚Äôll continue to be true.

***Reflecting / looking ahead***

* My target milestone is to hit **$1M net worth by 30**, which looks quite feasible at my current income and assuming my portfolio/the market doesn‚Äôt tank in the next 2 years.
* Getting to the first $100K really is the hardest - it just keeps snowballing from there, and your NW increases faster and faster... I only made a post about hitting $500K \~4 months ago! 
* **I don‚Äôt count illiquid equity in any of my projections**. Even though it might turn into a big payday if my current company goes public, for now, I treat it as imaginary money. (If it does become liquid, then my path to FI will accelerate substantially, given I have high six figures in nominal equity value, both vested/unvested.)
* **$2.5M is my fat-FI number**, but I‚Äôll probably keep working after I hit that. But who knows - if I get married / start a family / have kids, maybe my priorities will change.
* Leaving finance for tech was a big leap for me, in part because staying in finance was the path of least resistance / most prestige / highest comp. I could have left my top-tier investment banking job for a role in private equity / hedge funds / venture capital instead, and been making $300K+ comp as a 24-year-old (as many of my banking peers did). Taking a pay cut to go to a startup felt risky and uncomfortable at the time -- but I have no regrets, looking back. Leaving finance made me happier, healthier, and a better and more interesting person; even if it also meant a slightly longer path to hit NW milestones, I‚Äôm still doing just fine. The tradeoffs were more than worth it.

If folks have other questions, happy to answer them. I‚Äôve mostly lurked on this community but appreciate the helpful info & discussion I‚Äôve read here, so happy to try to contribute in turn.",807.0,financialindependence

**FIRE** 

**IS** 

**BORING**

Now, if you‚Äôre new to all this, it might be news to you. After all, it doesn‚Äôt feel boring in that first phase. Your mind has recently been blown with possibilities for your life you never before considered possible; Everywhere around you, you see opportunities to optimize your spending, your portfolio, your spreadsheets; There are so many books/blogs/podcasts you need to consume to become even more informed on it and optimize your plan even more... 

You want that initial rush of excitement over all the possibilities to last and sustain you and motivate you throughout this entire journey.

But the truth is, this phase doesn‚Äôt last. Within a year or two you‚Äôll have consumed just about every shred of relevant information you can. Your plan has been written and rewritten a dozen times. You‚Äôve had several dozen fights with your partner about whether or not it‚Äôs actually worth cutting another 2% out of your grocery budget and why the hell you have to keep the thermostat on 65 when it‚Äôs only saving $15/mo on your electric bill. Your spreadsheets have been stress tested and refined to levels of confidence several significant digits more than you‚Äôre actually capable of achieving‚Ä¶ you get the picture.

And now?

You just keep going. You track your budget. You check in on your NW every few months. You rebalance your portfolio maybe once a year. It takes a grand total of *maybe* 10 hrs of effort in any given year. People call it the boring middle, but it‚Äôs really more like the boring remaining 99%. 

99% of this is just sticking to the plan for decade, after decade, after decade. Not for a year, or two, or ten. But literally however many years you have left in your life. Because the work doesn‚Äôt stop when you reach FI or retire. After that, unless you‚Äôve just massively overestimated how much you need, you‚Äôve still got to keep living on the budget you‚Äôve set for yourself. And it's the same boring slog to just stay on track after retirement as it was before. 

People don‚Äôt fail at this because they‚Äôre missing some super secret knowledge that only the elite have access to. They don‚Äôt retire early because it‚Äôs just long, boring fucking work to commit to not spending money they otherwise could be for decades on end. 

So when you look at the front page of this sub and think ‚Äúugh, there‚Äôs just never any new content around here‚Äù. It‚Äôs because there **isn‚Äôt** any new content for people to post. 99.9% of what you need to know for this has been reiterated to death already on MMM, and ERE, and ERN, and Mad Fientist, and YMOYL, and r/FinancialIndependence, and god only knows how many other places before. And the actually new, interesting, relevant stuff takes a lot of time to put together and doesn‚Äôt come around on a daily basis to satisfy your habitual Reddit browsing.

And that‚Äôs how it should be. You‚Äôre not pursuing FI for its entertainment value. You‚Äôre doing it because (presumably) you want to actually do something else with the security, freedom, and time it affords you. And if you are doing it for the entertainment, you're actually making it less likely you'll succeed here. Because the second the novelty starts to wear off, you're going to start looking somewhere else for it, and then it's all ""ooh look, Tesla announced a new model"". 

You want exciting? Go look at loss porn on WSB. 

You want to actually build a predictable and reliable plan for retirement that you can execute on over the course of decades? It‚Äôs going to be boring.",451.0,financialindependence
46,Nearing FIRE w/ $2.6M NW at age 33 ‚Äì My journey & thoughts,,2008.0,j1ny7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j1ny7k/nearing_fire_w_26m_nw_at_age_33_my_journey/,1601337211.0,"**TLDR:** Here‚Äôs goes my first ever post on Reddit: Just hit $2.6M net worth at age 33 after discovering I was working towards FIRE without knowing what it was until stumbling across it online last year. Wife doesn‚Äôt care, but wanted to tell someone. My story, lessons learned, & how FIRE changed my strategy.

**Reasons for FIRE:** I‚Äôve worked from home for a tech company for 13 years (Support Delivery)  Unlike many people on this sub, I actually love my job, and would do it forever, but know I got incredible lucky and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve lasted this long already with the BS corporate performance cycle, quotas, etc.  My skillset is not transferrable, so if/when they fire me, I‚Äôd likely be starting at the ground-level at another company making little $, and probably not working from home, so I decided that when that days comes, I want to be ready.   In a way I see it as being a ""good steward"" so to speak of the hand and luck that I was dealt, and I want to make sure I'm not squandering that by pissing it away on things that don't matter.   Curious if anyone else is in the same boat with why they're pursuing FIRE?

I‚Äôm a bit of a lone wolf with how I live life, so when I stumbled across the FIRE movement online last year, I was excited to find the formal framework for what I had been pursuing on my own for years. I had never heard of the 4% rule, and didn‚Äôt even think about stocks as a viable option for early retirement, so my focus had been on buy-&-hold rentals, which after managing 7 myself, although almost no work when counted in hours, started becoming more *stressful* than I liked.

This sub, along with the blogs like MMM, changed my approach and for the past year, I‚Äôve been slowly changing my focus on simplifying my investments, stopped buying homes and started dumping excess income into VTI instead, and even sold my first rental this year.

**Income:** Started at $48k in 2007, now $160k + $70k profit from 7 rentals mostly owned with cash.

**Spending:** My current savings rate is 87%. I spend only $26k / year somehow but feel I live luxuriously. I own 2 cars, dirt bikes, ATVs (all Hondas), and spend plenty of time each year vacationing overseas. My #1 expense is travel, and some trips I figure out a way to get the owner of our side-gig (performing arts) to pay for as long as we perform or teach while there (while also making the trip partially tax deductible too). [Link to my current spending / income / savings rate chart](https://i.imgur.com/BKAGvgF.jpg)

**Investments:** [Link to my mint.com entire NW summary](https://i.imgur.com/xvTLC6P.jpg)

* **$1.35M** ‚Äì paid off real estate (now 7 total homes, $1.6M minus $367k in mortgages), includes my personal $300k house. Average ROI for my rentals is 14% w/ just rents, 39% if capital appreciation is factored in. It‚Äôs lower because most of them are paid off, so less leverage. [(Screenshot of Rental ROI Details)](https://i.imgur.com/waVzvqy.jpg)  I used my HELOC to pay ""cash"" for homes, then aggressively paid it down and repeated.  Was probably risky, but it's paid off now, and is my ""E-fund"" now.
* **$500k** ‚Äì Taxable (VTI / VXUS) ‚Äì M1Finance [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/bYFuyXi.jpg) Their automation is awesome btw
* **$220k** ‚Äì Taxable in my company‚Äôs stock, acquired through ESPP. Yes I want to move this to VTI, but $130k is gains, so don‚Äôt know how to without a huge tax bill.  Any ideas?
* **$345k** ‚Äì 401k maxed out [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/3vMwfQk.jpg) (Russel 3000, the best options I could find)
* **$96k** ‚Äì Other (HSA maxed out, joint SoFi account w/ wife, Prosper.com, 24k cash, etc)

**Taxes:** Federal taxes paid is $16k / year. Real estate helps a lot here, plus our side gig which turns many expenses, hobbies, & travel I'd pay anyway into deductions.

**Marriage:** I‚Äôm married, but we keep our finances separate, so all these numbers are my own. We both contribute an equal amount into a small joint checking for things like groceries & utilities. I‚Äôve shared with her my net worth when I crossed $2.0M, but she didn‚Äôt seem to care much.

**Family Life:** No help from family, at all... I actually ran away from home as a minor and never went back.  I took the GED and started college at age 15, graduated at 19.  I think pushing the ""youngest to graduate blah blah"" narrative hard with the college recruiters definitely helped me land the tech job, not because I was particularly skilled.  I've been working full time since age 16.

**Current Plan:**

* Ride this job out as long as I can without getting fired in spite waning motivation and struggling with work performance.  Enjoy the freedom of working from ""home"", wherever home is that day.
* Continue simplifying finances. Sell 220k of company stock somehow. Want to also sell a few more homes eventually and put that $ in the stock market. I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping a few long term if I don‚Äôt have another job to give me something to do.  Dreading the capital gains bill from all this.

**Thoughts & Reflections:**

* My philosophy in life (FIRE, taxes, politics, money) has been ""tell me what the rules of the game are, and I'll figure out how to win"".  I see so many people whining how they can never succeed in the current ""system"" (thankfully not so much on this sub), when in reality, no one is going to come along and change the rules for you personally so you can succeed.  It's your job to win given the current system the best we can.
* I bought my houses in 2013‚Äì2018, when prices were still near the bottom after the recession. I realize this was just luck, and don‚Äôt intend to keep pushing that luck or think that is a repeatable format. No regrets, I just got very lucky.
* Keep maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, something I didn't start doing until discovering FIRE.
* I had dumped a bunch of money in cryptos over the last couple years. Finally pulled the plug and got out with big losses. They're right, the pain of seeing losses is way worse than gains. Oh well.
* This year I finally sold all my hard gold and silver that I've owned since 1999.  Yes, it was in preparation for Y2K.  Also yes, I was just a 13 year old child (but a very prepared child!)
* Focus on choosing a career path that maximizes income first in any way possible. That's far more important than cutting $20 off your cell phone bill.  This should be the 1st step to FIRE.
* IMO, doing ‚Äúsomething you love‚Äù isn‚Äôt as glamorous as it sounds. I went to college for art, and realized that although it seemed ‚Äúfun‚Äù, it doesn't pay, and there‚Äôs no quicker way to kill a fun hobby than having to do it for a living. Also, I‚Äôd rather work a fraction my life at a desk job than my whole life doing something I thought sounded cool at age 20. If the 8-5 desk job doesn‚Äôt sound fun, focus on what makes decent money that you COULD still find enjoyable. There‚Äôs more options you could enjoy than you realize. Instead of just focusing on ‚Äúwhat sounds fun to ME‚Äù, focus on ‚Äúwhat does the world need more of‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhat's in high demand in my community that I‚Äôd enjoy somewhat at least‚Äù. The money often follows that.
* In the beginning I was focused on maximizing returns, which is why I chose rentals. Average work is only a 1-2 hours / week, BUT, I‚Äôve realized I hate the stress. E.g. recent text from tenant: ‚ÄúSent my brother to check on house, he got stabbed by squatters, is in hospital‚Äù. ‚Ä¶talk about a way to ruin a weekend (well, more like 4 months, squatters are no joke). Now that I have higher net worth & more money ‚Äúworking for me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt mind sacrificing return % for peace of mind.
* Don‚Äôt turn down living your best life today. There are tons of opportunities, trips, etc that seemed like they cost a lot of money at the time, but turned out to some of my best memories that I would never give up, even if I missed out on compounding gains as a result. Say yes to the parts of life that come along that excite you, and don‚Äôt put if off until retirement, since these are what make life worth living, not your net worth $.  I often think ‚Äúif I died today, would I have regrets having focused on savings so much‚Äù? Find that balance & slash the stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter.  For us, that‚Äôs kids, big house, alcohol, nice hotels, wedding, any status symbols, etc).

As you can see, I'm an open book, so I'm open to any thoughts, questions, or advice on anything I may be overlooking or doing wrong.",626.0,financialindependence
47,I left a FAANG pre-FI for a more fulfilling job and took more than a 50% pay cut. It was not everything I expected it to be.,,1974.0,jhe6va,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/,1603564946.0,"But it was some of the things I expected it to be.

This is my first post here, though I‚Äôve been commenting on this sub for a while now, and I lurked long before that. I want to share my story because I think it will resonate with many people here, and maybe it will help some people. It probably will most closely resonate with people of a similar background: tech workers who are feeling jaded after working at a large tech company for a few years. However, I think it could be relatable for anyone considering leaving a comfortable but unfulfilling job, in search for something more meaningful. This post is not going to cover many specifics about financials or financial advice, but a FI mindset strongly influenced my decision-making. It‚Äôs a common topic of this sub to experience a longing for more fulfilling work, especially once you have FU money or are approaching coastFI, and having made the leap about 9 months ago I think I have some insight about how things can turn out if you choose to take a leap of faith.

I also fully acknowledge that many on this sub don‚Äôt experience a need for more fulfilling work; several of you find other means of fulfillment and just want to FIRE ASAP, period, and that is totally fine, but this post may be less relevant to you.

#Background

I joined a FAANG as a software dev after graduating college. I was fortunate to graduate with less than 10k in debt, and I paid it off quickly. I performed well and was promoted after about two years. As my NW increased, it felt like blinders were slowly being removed from my eyes. Like many people on here, I had a lot of anxiety about financial security growing up - so much so that getting a high paying job was virtually all I thought about since I was in high school. As my NW hit 100k, I started to feel somewhat secure about money and my employability; I took a step back and started to realize that I was never going to feel fulfilled by the work I was doing (which involved working on an interesting but not very impactful smartphone feature). Without as much financial anxiety, I was able to give myself space to reflect and understand what my real goals were - something I had neglected for a long time.

I tried to make it work on my old team. I thought that if I found the right kind of role or peer group, I could tolerate not feeling like my work was that important. But I knew deep down that wouldn‚Äôt be the case.

I also looked for opportunities on other teams. I think this could have worked out. I found one opening that seemed like it would be a work style I liked better (TSE rather than SWE), and in an area that felt more impactful (healthcare).

But I ended up finding an opportunity elsewhere that was more risky but seemed potentially more rewarding for me.

#Reflections and the next opportunity

In my reflections, I realized I really regretted not taking more humanities and social science classes in college. I barrelled through the CS curriculum with tunnel vision, intent only on getting a job at a FAANG or similar. I had always wanted to study psychology, but, coming from a family of engineers, voices in my head always told me that wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù field.

Additionally, I started to feel a growing need to do work that was impactful and helped people. I think anyone might feel this longing, but I think those from marginalized communities such as myself might be especially likely to feel this need to give back. As my confidence in my abilities and skills grew, it started to feel ridiculous that I wasn‚Äôt using them for social good.

I began searching for career paths that would scratch my itch to learn about more social science fields, and that would be impactful in ways I found fulfilling. I still wanted to work in something at least partially technical, since I wanted to make use of my skill set. I eventually found a not-for-profit research center nearby that focused on applying computational methods to complex social problems, varying from sex trafficking to religious extremism. I reached out to the organization, and ended up meeting some staff to discuss the field and what I might do to get involved. I was hoping for some PhD program recommendations, which they gave (for anyone wondering, they recommended I apply to CS or Engineering programs, and specialize in something like computational social science). But it also turned out that they had a grant that was getting dispersed in the next month, and someone with my background would be appropriate for one of the roles in that project.

At that time, I had about 110k in retirement accounts, 70k in taxable accounts, and around 10-15k cash. I was 24 years old. Arguably, I was lean-coastFI, meaning if I didnt save anything more, I could probably be leanFI by retirement age just on the savings that compounded. I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, but at my old job I was probably making close to 200k/yr including RSUs and bonus. I got an offer for the other job, and the pay was 88k - not a terrible salary but definitely a huge cut - still, I was expecting 65-70k, so I was a bit surprised. Healthcare benefits were similar. Retirement options and general perks were better at the FAANG but not terrible at the other org.

I thought about it a lot. I met the staff at the org multiple times to feel it out as best I could. I tried to keep myself in check, but I‚Äôll admit that I was very hopeful and idealistic that taking this opportunity was going to give my work so much more meaning, and that the pay cut was going to be totally worth it.

#9 months later: the grass is not as green as I thought it would be, but it is still greener

There are days when my work is everything I thought it would be; I get to step into a really interesting and impactful research project, and unblock or build upon it using my tech/CS background. Or, I get to learn about interesting research and apply a computational lens to it. When my days are like this, the adage ‚ÄúFind work you love and you will never work a day in your life‚Äù really feels true.

But, this is not every day. Sometimes I‚Äôll go weeks or months without one of these days, and it sucks. Just like my old job, there are some projects that are isolating, chaotic, or too unstructured. On these days, it can feel like work is work, and FI is the only way to achieve balance.

Add in life changes due to the pandemic, and it‚Äôs been a really rough few months. (To be clear, the pandemic had not started when I accepted the job offer. I‚Äôm not sure how that would have affected my decision-making, but I‚Äôm sure it would have shaken things up a bit.)

While it has only been 9 months, and some of the most unprecedented months at that, these are the lessons I‚Äôve learned about taking the leap for a more fulfilling job. These are as much lessons about myself as they are about the world I live in; I‚Äôm sure some of these simply do not apply to you, but I like to think that some of you will benefit from reading this. I repeat: I do not claim these to be universal truths.

##Purpose and fulfillment are forward-thinking, long-term concepts, not something that is lived day to day

When I started this job, I‚Äôll admit a part of me expected everyday to be dramatically more fulfilling than my old job. This is simply not the case. Yes, some days are exhilarating in a way that my old job never could be, but many days are not. That being said, when I think about what I could accomplish in 3, 5, or 10 years at this current position, I am significantly more content with the possibilities here than at my old job. When I think about the experience I am getting at this job, I know that it‚Äôs putting me on a track toward being the professional/field-expert I want to be - even if I were to end up changing jobs or the company dies.

I now believe that this is what purpose and fulfillment from a career means for me. It doesn‚Äôt mean changing someone‚Äôs life every single day - though I imagine it could be like that in other fields like medical professions or social work, for instance. But, even those fields, I imagine, are going to have down days where even the best efforts don‚Äôt seem to make a difference (‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll project onto professions I have no experience in). You need to be fulfilled by the long term potential, because day-to-day wins/losses are not going to be sustainably fulfilling.

##A fulfilling job is still a job

Some of my projects are less interesting than others. Sometimes I have to work on a project that I don‚Äôt think has a lot of potential for impact. Sometimes a project is isolating or poorly managed. Some days I feel like a codemonkey/grunt and not the creative professional I strive to be. During my first several months, these realities hit hard. I thought, ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this when I know I‚Äôm capable of doing better things?‚Äù

What I‚Äôve learned is that sometimes it‚Äôs best to take a step back, sort of put yourself on autopilot with your job, and put less symbolic meaning into it. Similar to how you set up auto-deposits into your market accounts, you have to look towards the future and ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs the direction I am headed toward one that I am proud of? Will it, to the best of my knowledge, give me experiences that I want to have had in the long term?‚Äù If the answer is yes, let that be the end of it: treat your job like a job and let your time on it accumulate. Have no expectations about your day to day experience. Just like the market, my workdays have dramatic up and down swings. I have to assume that if I am properly allocated (metaphorically), my professional ‚Äúnet worth‚Äù will trend upward, and not let myself feel despair during a ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù (I hope this metaphor makes sense‚Ä¶)

Another way of thinking about this: internal motivation is not always reliable. Some days I‚Äôm not super motivated to work on projects that I actually really like. On these days, I‚Äôm reminded that a fulfilling job is still a job, and to expect otherwise can lead to disappointment. I try not to lose sight of the fact that I am where, to the best of my knowledge, I want to be - even if it occasionally does not feel like it.

##Being around people who share your values is extremely important, but it‚Äôs not all that matters

One of the things I love about my job is that everyone in the org is dedicated to the organization‚Äôs goals, and these goals are ones that strongly resonate with me. The same could not be said, IMO, about my old job. However, there are much fewer people with my professional background (software/CS) here than my old job, and sometimes that can be isolating. Especially when working on less desirable projects.

I knew from the get-go that there would be fewer devs I‚Äôd be interacting with, but that didn‚Äôt stop it from getting a bit painful at times. Thankfully, I have been able to advocate with some success that we get more engineers on a project. And, there is some reasonable expectation of growth in the next year, such that we should be able to hire a few more devs I will work closely with.

I guess the advice here is do not expect that being around people with shared values will always be an adequate substitute for the kind of collaboration that only comes from working with people with a similar professional background. You need both.

##You may still need to seek out external professional development in order to meet your goals

One of my goals when I got my new job was to learn about new fields. In particular, social sciences. At first, I thought that given the dramatic career shift I made, I would meet this goal primarily through my work. And, some days I do. But, as is becoming a trend in this post, this is not always my daily experience. I have decided to pursue extension school classes in psychology to fill this goal so that I can reliably fulfill it. I plan to get a certification in the next year or two, and potentially continue to a master‚Äôs degree over the next five years. I took a class last spring, and while I did not take a class this fall, I have decided to dedicate some time everyday to reading a textbook or research paper in an area of my interest. This way, I am meeting my learning goal nearly every day, even on days when I am not learning on the job. I find it essential to set up a routine where I am *reliably* fulfilling this goal, otherwise I get very down.

##You won‚Äôt feel fulfilled by your job if you are not happy with your home life

The pandemic is a good case study for this. The last several months have been very destabilizing to my home environment, and this made it really difficult to tolerate downswings at work. There has, at times, been a temptation to quit and try something else. But, in retrospect, this temptation came more from the uncertainty about the world and what my personal life would look like in it. My SO and I have made a lot of changes to adapt to a COVID-19 world, and I can say that finally having what feels like a stable and pandemic-safe home-life balance really alleviates my temptation to run. Sometimes I think I feel a temptation to leave work just so that I can feel like, for a second, I have control over my life during a time in which there are such extreme external circumstances that are outside of my control.

##If you think you cannot apply your skillset/experience to a new field, you are probably wrong

When I started looking for other jobs, I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do the kind of work I wanted without going back to school. But that was not the only option, and it probably is not for most people considering a career change. Do the legwork to find organizations that resonate with you, and reach out to see if/how you can apply your background.

##Sometimes things work out in unexpected ways, so have faith

I felt stuck in a project that really didn‚Äôt resonate with me for a while. But I kept working on it, even though there were times where I dragged my feet. I didn‚Äôt want to make a stink when I was so new to the job. Over time, though, it became clear that this project could have other applications that actually much more strongly aligned with my interests. And, other parties started to become very interested in these new applications. I still have some reservations, but, overall, a situation that felt a bit bleak did get better.

I‚Äôll remember this in the future, and try not to get too down about situations that feel bad in the moment.

##Great managers exist and are so much better than good managers

At my old job, I had three managers. One was OK - his management style did not mesh well with me, but I think it was a style that worked for some. The other two were pretty good. It‚Äôs hard to think of complaints. But my current manager continuously surprises me with their level of understanding and compassion. I feel much more at ease discussing issues that I am facing because I know I will be listened to without judgement.

#The verdict: Was it worth it?

The short answer is that 9 months is not enough time to definitively judge if it was worth it. But, I‚Äôve had a lot of ups and downs in these 9 months (as we all have), and I can say that I am still very hopeful about the future, even if I did have some less hopeful moments. I‚Äôve done some really cool things, and I feel good about the direction I‚Äôm headed. Additionally, my salary was raised to 93k (from 88k), and there are plans that, if go well, may increase my salary to 120k in 2021. So, it‚Äôs within the realm of possibility that I could still be making a reasonably competitive salary again one day‚Ä¶

And yet, the money feels more like a perk than the main draw to the job. I‚Äôve made peace with some of the realities that I was maybe too idealistic about in the beginning, but my level of existential contentment is still much higher than it was. I‚Äôm at a point where I feel reasonably confident that this career switch was a good choice in my life. And, if I can feel that way even when we are knee-deep in a pandemic, I think it‚Äôs likely a reliable assessment.

Was just curious if I'm alone here

I've been so focused on optimizing every aspect of my lifestyle it almost became unhealthy. I wondered how sustainable it was because I was killing myself at a job that I hated and still was many years out from reaching my retirement goal.

I realized that it wasn't work itself that I hated but the type of work that I was doing. I decided to adjust my thinking a bit and save enough money for me to take a leap and start my dream venture. I still plan on taking the FIRE principles of frugality, minimalism and maximum savings but for a slightly adjusted goal.

Just want to take a moment to say thank you to this sub for educating me so much over the past couple of years in my own journey to FI.  So many of you have been a tremendous help.

I‚Äôve been through 2 big downturns (2001 and 2008). My advice is to stay the course through this. We‚Äôve all been saying that we would, but the rubber is meeting the road now and we‚Äôre all going to be tested. In my opinion, this is likely to get worse which as you all know gives us a buying opportunity. It has the same feelings the other ones had in terms of fear. Anyway, I wish you all the best.

Spoiler: I'm loving the FIRE and don't have any plan to go back to work at all!  I've put the TL;DR up front, but I've got a lot more details below if you're interested in reading those!

* After taking an 11 month Leave of Absence, I officially gave my notice and my last day of employment was in early January.
* My net worth went from $1.10M to $1.40M with a few paychecks, cashing out a ton of PTO, a small annual bonus, and a surging stock market. With my current budget of $33K/year, this would amount to a 2.37% withdrawal rate, which for someone who is risk averse (especially given the long bull run in the past decade and valuations where they are currently at) is very comforting.
* 2019 Actual budget was only $500 above planned and I found that a lot of my planned budget categories costs were higher than my actual spend.
* Overall, I'm extremely happy with my decision to RE - I can spend more time with my hobbies, friends, and [pursue things that are bringing more meaning to my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dbcrtr/giving_after_fire_1_month_volunteering_at_summer/). I know there have been a few recent posts about not being happy after RE, but I'm truly enjoying all of it and not finding any boredom whatsoever!
* I applied and got accepted to a second LGBT summer camp as a cabin counselor! I've got 3 days at a spring camp, 3 weeks with Summer Camp #1, and 5 weeks with Summer Camp #2.  With training for each of the camps, it'll be 68 days of volunteering this summer!
* Major goal this is to get better at climbing (leading sport and trad climbs outdoor at 5.10b-5.10d level) so I can apply to be an outdoor instructor at Outward Bound or NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School).

In the rest of the post I will cover the following topics: Major FIRE actions, Quality of Life Update, Budget in FIRE, Goals for Year 2 of FIRE,  Notable Experiences Since my Last Update, and Notable Events/Trips for 2020. So read on for more details!

# Major FIRE actions

* Moved 401k to Vanguard IRA rollover account. This gave me some anxiety because a mid 6-figure check was sent via snail-mail. o\_O
* Changed taxable investments to not auto-invest to get a cashflow source not that I'm not generating a salary.  I got $18K in dividends from my taxable accounts last year, most of it qualified.
* After lots of research and debating pros/cons, I decided to balance health care costs, present taxes, with future taxes and am targeting an AGI of $30,200 next year.  I will have the roughly $18K in dividends (based on 2019) and $12,200 of of IRA to Roth IRA rollover income. If dividends come in lower than $18K, I will sell of some mutual funds to get LT capital gains to make up the difference. **My estimated 2020 tax at that income level will be $975 ($400 Federal and $575 State).** The $30.2K AGI puts me in the top range for the Silver 73 CSR subsidy range. I hypothetically had the option to keep my premium to $1/month with super low deductibles and out of pocket costs, but it didn't leave any headroom to convert IRA to Roth IRA. Ultimately, I chose to pay a higher health insurance premiums ($474/year instead of $12/year), which is effectively a 3.80% tax to rollover $12.2K to Roth IRA.  
* Signed up for ACA covereage started Feb 1st for $39.50/month for a Silver 73 HMO with CSR with $3700/$375 deductible with fixed fee co-pays for normal doctor visits and labs/tests. There were issues with the website so I had to call in via phone to continue the application. Also, I had to talk to them and insist/clarify that I no longer had health insurance at work  - they input it into the system that I still had a job and it was going to cost me something like $500+/month.

# Quality of Life Update

I definitely don't feel any guilt about not working or feel bored (I've seen a lot of posts recently commenting on either or both topics) - I've got so many things I do outside of work that I enjoy and I've been able to spend so much more time with friends and family post-FIRE.

**Downshifting**

I have a much more laid back attitude with life. Before FIRE I was very much a ""always on the go"", Type A kind of person, feeling like I had to optimize every bit of every day, partially because I had limited time at home, but also because I wanted to ""maximize life"". While on a 3 week vacation, I actually had 1-2 days where I actually just lounged around at my hotel swimming pool instead of seeing cultural sights and exploring the city. If you bet me a year ago that I'd spend an entire day not doing anything besides laying at the pool and eating, I would have thought you were crazy. With the ability to do slower travel and therefore less pressure to squeeze everything in, I've found that FIRE has given me a a stronger sense of calm/relaxation from the normal frantic life and resulted in a lot less stress.

**Decisions and Structure**

From time to time, I found that there was a lot of things to do and it was often tiring to choose what to do. Making decisions takes energy and effort (see the book ""The Paradox of Choice"" for further information on choice and loss aversion). With a large lack of defined work schedule and structure, it was taking energy to make those decisions. What I've done to combat having to make so many decisions is to create a shell structure so I'm doing the things I want to avoid suffering from decision fatigue.

For example, Monday nights are always board game nights at my lcoal store, Monday and Thursday afternoon are my lead climbing days, Tuesdays are my puzzles or cheap movie nights, and Friday are my theater nights. Nothing is set in stone of course, but having the structure relieves me from having to make decisions all the time over things that I want to do and can let me spend more time on meaningful decisions.

# Budget in FIRE

I spent more on travel and some other areas, but surprisingly my spend was still only <$500 greater than my planned budget, despite paying for (effectively) Cobra Health Insurance for 6 months. The following are a few random musings of some areas where my budget has decreased as a result of FIRE:

**Lower expenses as a result of FIRE:**

* Saving on airfare by travelling on non-peak days/times.
* Taking advantage of $5 Tuesdays at AMC and other matinee movie prices.
* Lower food costs because I'm eating more at home more often.
* Lower transit costs because I've been riding my bike much more. Previously, I felt pressed for time so I would take the bus or train to places or Uber/Lyft, but now I get on my bike for more exercise and fresh air, while saving money.
* Will get about 2 months of ""free"" food (\~$1100 based on my budget) while volunteering at summer camp. Note: I'm doing the camp because I love it and it's not really ""free"" since I'm donating a lot of my time, but it just happens to be a side perk for volunteering.

# Goals for Year 2 of FIRE

* Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.
* Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).
* Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).
* Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor.  I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.

# Notable experiences since my last [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bqv9i4/100_days_on_loa_a_quantitative_view_of_my_time/):

* Ate at Blue Hill at Stone Barnes.
* Mountain biked for the first time, including some pretty difficult (for me) single track.
* Did a 5 pitch multi pitch route, leading 3 pitches (it was super soft). Climbed 2 different 6B+ routes (\~5.10D) on top rope without any takes. Those are the hardest grades I've ever climbed.
* Saw a 7 hour play, The Inheritance, which was absolutely incredible.
* Visited Thailand for 3 weeks, my 38th country.
* Saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!

# Notable planned events/trips for 2020

* Disneyworld and Universal Studios for a 10 days.
* Brazil trip for a month to travel/climb and to see my new niece (I'm a first time uncle!).
* Volunteer at two summer camps (including training, 68 days).
* Text/phone bank and canvas for swing states in September/October.
* Laos and Cambodia trip for 3 weeks to climb in Thakkek.

52,Taking a mini-retirement changed my FIRE plans permanently,,1804.0,kcik2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kcik2p/taking_a_miniretirement_changed_my_fire_plans/,1607892831.0,"2 years ago, I was in a demanding well paid job (Sales Engineering) where despite the perks, pay and status I found myself often day dreaming about retiring to a tropical island and checking on my FIRE spread sheets to see how close I am. After a lot of soul searching, I decided to quit. Went on a mini retirement for a few months and switch to a much easier job I knew I could coast in at a 40% paycut. This is a follow up to [the original post I made at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96jo5r/your_fire_obsession_may_be_a_symptom_of_stress/).

&#x200B;

That was hands down the best decision I have made for my quality of life. My outlook of life and future has changed rather dramatically since then but here is a brief list of things I did and lessons I learned:

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Mini-retirement and switch to lower stress role completely changed my outlook of work. I went from wanting to FIRE ASAP to wanting to go back to work and stay there. The change has persisted for 2 years now. I now no longer see myself ever fully retiring. I should be FI in about 6 years but I don't see it changing much in my life.

&#x200B;

**Events**:

* Setting up 3 month mini retirement: After I quit my job and landed the new role, I realized I hadn't had more than a week off in my entire adult life. I decided it was foolish to plan the rest of my life to work for retirement but never even sample it. And man am I glad I did. I negotiated a delayed start date with my new manager. He had worked with me before and wanted me badly on the team so he agreed.
* First month off: During the first month off I did exactly the type of thing you'd expect someone released from the bondage of work to do. I flew across the country. Drove down the west cost all the way from Canada to San Diego and back, camped in national parks all the way through. Visited family and friends all over the country.
* Emulated retired living for 2 months: The next two months I intentionally tried not to treat my time off as a big vacation and use this time to learn how life would be after retirement. At first many of my days became really unproductive and overshadowed by a feeling of uselessness and slow decay. I usually have no trouble with motivation but I found myself struggling to do much more than play games all day in my PJs. This is when I learned that I have very different mindsets for when I want to get shit done and relax. In order to put myself in the right mindset I started to structure my days a little more. Wake up at a certain time and get a morning routine: shower, coffee, walk. Work on a few personal projects for a few hours to feel a sense of accomplishment. One thing that I started to miss a lot was the social contact at work. Seeing my friends frequently quickly became a very important part of my life during this time.
* New role (QA Engineer): My new role turned out to be exactly as relaxing as I had remembered. There is this implied social narrative that all jobs are equally challenging especially if they pay similarly. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one will openly admit they have an easy job. On top of the fact that very few people have had more than 1 serious career and thus have no accurate way of comparing to other positions. This is my third (did software development as well) and I can confirm that the level of overall stress and cost/benefit ratio between roles even in the same company can be drastically different.

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned**:

* FIRE (specifically RE) fantasies were nothing more than sophisticated tools of escapism. Once I eliminated the main sources of stress from my job, I automatically stopped living in the future. It is an unhealthy way of not living in the present and living life to the fullest.
* Work provides a lot more than money for most people. Much more than people give it credit for and most of it unappreciated. It's also a major source of structure, socialization, challenges, recognition, sense of accomplishment, identity and sense of purpose. In it's absence, you have to recreate a lot of these things on your own except often not as successfully and without the money or motivation.
* Socialization outside of work is really difficult. If you already have a well established social circle and do not plan to move, you might be fine. But if you are planning on meeting people, it will become exceedingly difficult to form strong bonds. Strong bonds often require suffering shared negative experiences together. School and work have a natural way of doing just that. Recreating that when the baser needs are satisfied is much harder than it seems.
* Never settling for a stressful position. The only regret I have is me trying to hang on to positions that were actively hurting my health and not appreciating the amazing life experiences that were passing me by. The money I traded those experiences and my limited time on earth for, has already lost much of its significance.

&#x200B;

By the end of the 3 months I was aching to get back to my work routine. HR messed up my start date in the new position by pushing it forward a week and I was disappointed enough in it that I asked the manager to get it fixed so I can start when I wanted.",357.0,financialindependence
53,"Life and Death, a perspective.",,1764.0,hbnyfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hbnyfi/life_and_death_a_perspective/,1592517474.0,"  

I shared a piece of my story a few days ago and despite it receiving a large number of positive votes and comments, the powers deemed it inappropriate. So allow me to try again and this time I will be much more direct in my thoughts.

Several years ago, just as the ‚Äò08/‚Äô09 crisis was irrupting I greatly expanded my business as a final push towards my own FIRE goals even though I had never heard of the FIRE movement. The brass ring was inches from my fingers when my industry was utterly destroyed upon the shoals of that disaster. Even though I didn‚Äôt fulfill my goals, I got close enough to enjoy some of the fruits of my labors and I stopped working 80 hours a week. My life‚Äôs story has been one of never quite making it, but being happy with the outcome nevertheless.

Now for the rest of the story‚Ä¶

Quite a few years ago I knew the scale had tipped. My yesterdays outnumbered my tomorrows. You can look at actuary tables, family histories and still you only have a guess at best. On May 27th I found out how far my guess was from reality. I knew something was wrong with my heart and asked my wife to drive me to the ER. Attempts at installing stints failed and I was scheduled for immediate open heart surgery. My surgeon explained to me that with disease this progressed you usually never find out about ‚Ä¶ but your family will. I survived and am on the mend but I am facing a very long and difficult road which is unlikely to lead back to my old work life. (Thank God for small favors!)

The Stoics talk about living life as if you are about to die, which is what I used to think I did. That is until I faced the very real possibility of not surviving the surgery (which I almost didn‚Äôt). I am unsure as to what changes, large and small, I will make in my life and perspective. I am not making any even slightly major decisions for at least another 3 months.

My thoughts for this group is simply to take my experience as a cautionary tale. My life nearly ended shortly after my 58th birthday. I almost became one of those ‚Äúit is a shame he died so young.‚Äù You do not know the extent of your tomorrows, but you do have today. Cherish your loved ones, call your parents today, hug your spouse, and be a friend to someone who needs it. These are far more important than anything else because tomorrow you may not have. 

Pursue FIRE, for it is a worthy objective, but never forget to keep things in balance and be sure to have lived today.",189.0,financialindependence
54,"TIL Warren Buffet ""retired early""",,1756.0,kvzs92,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvzs92/til_warren_buffet_retired_early/,1610482814.0,"I was watching a video on YouTube about Buffett's early years and it mentioned that at the age of 25, he felt he had enough funds to retire and was seriously considering it.

Quote from him:  ‚ÄúThe thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I‚Äôll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot‚ÄîI was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, ‚ÄúCompound interest guarantees I‚Äôm going to get rich.‚Äù 

In ""retirement"", some people asked him what to do with their money, and he ended up starting a partnership to help manage money... the rest is history!

Just a fun thing I thought I'd share in this forum \^\^

56,I.....think we somehow hit our number much earlier than expected. Kind of in shock. I‚Äôm usually pretty adaptable but this is a big deal- with nobody to tell. So here is the new bar for the record. And my motivation.,,1754.0,hp6h8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hp6h8i/ithink_we_somehow_hit_our_number_much_earlier/,1594455325.0,"41 and 35 couple. LCOL area. Spend without really economizing much is 60k. Tracked via mint the last 10 months.  This includes a luxurious (IMO) 15k vacation budget. 

Taxes are due so I‚Äôve been looking at the numbers. We make significant money and invest a lot in real estate. It makes the numbers a little murky day to day. Lots of pass through money. 

I‚Äôm not a weekly or monthly spreadsheet tracker. I‚Äôm not even particularly organized. I mostly operate by rough estimates, gut feelings and spot checks. I probably don‚Äôt fit in here. 

We are refinancing a chunk of our rental portfolio and the values have gone up according to fresh appraisals. A lot. We applied significant leverage at a good time and won the housing market timing lotto. We doubled down multiple times and did very well.  

The portfolio equity + retirement accounts + cash is now conservatively 1.5 million. The 4% rule says we could sell and coast on index funds. But transaction costs and capital gains  would probably net us 1.1, so not quite. 

Then we analyzed cash flow. I haven‚Äôt used my paycheck for living expenses in 18 months.   This is a good sign. After a round  of refinancing the rentals will cash flow roughly 4000 a month.  My rockstar real estate agent partner could sell the 3 houses a year to cover the gap in her sleep. She currently sells 30+. 

But...I have a lot of excuses. I like my job,mostly. I kinda want more than the minimum. It will take some time to exit gracefully. I‚Äôm scared. I still have youngish kids. 
So tonight we set a new bar. I‚Äôm writing it down so it doesn‚Äôt creep too much. 

OLD BAR:
17 units. $200 cash flow per unit. 1 million net worth. Work to 55 for pension. Annual income at retirement about 60k, rising rapidly as units are paid off, reaching 150k at 70. 

NEW BAR:
5000 a month cash flow from rentals verified by 9 months of clean book keeping. 
2 units paid off. (This should boost cash flow a fair amount) 

2 years expenses in cash

1.5 million net worth after transaction costs etc. call it 1.9 in all portfolios. 

Finish renovations on our house and new roofs on 10 units. 

Expected time frame:  1.5 years if the market cooperates. 


Motivation: watching my grandparents fade away and seeing their best years are gone. At age 85 they live happily on 25k because they mostly watch TV and tend their lawn. Having 100k annually doesn‚Äôt make strokes less grim or restore grandma‚Äôs mind.  It can‚Äôt ease the pain in joints or restore strength and balance. 

It is probably better to go do things I want now and spend time with my kids while I can and not pad the accounts too much more.

57,How my wife saved me (financially as well as other tings),,1717.0,k9h5l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9h5l3/how_my_wife_saved_me_financially_as_well_as_other/,1607474699.0,"First let me say I am making this post in response to the amazing and overwhelming comments I received as a result of my comment on another post. You guys are all amazing. I waited until my wife was home and she's here with my as I type making sure I don't miss anything and also to fact check when I exaggerate as I have a tendency to do.

TL;DR: I was a middle-class suburban bum who didn't know anything about money and my wife came from nothing and her work ethic and ability to organize money led me to pay off my student loans last week

Now to get an idea of both myself and my wife I'll give you a little background. I came from a typical Middle Class, suburban American family. My mom is a nurse and my dad has done everything from own a chair factory to delivering dental supplies, but we always were pretty well off. This is also partly due to my father's family being very wealthy and allowing him to inherit the money to buy his home with zero mortgage. Financially, I was taught little or nothing growing up, everyone is aware of the lack of financial prep in the US school system, and my family treated money as a sort of ""dirty"" topic. If you did something for free you were ""clean"" and ""noble"" if you did things outright for the pay it was ""mercenary"" and not considered good. When I was told to look for careers both me and my siblings weren't told ""make sure you can make a living and take care of yourselves"" but ""do what you love, the money doesn't matter"" and the classic ""money doesn't bring happiness"". It took me years to learn that a lack of money can certainly bring UNhappiness.

So, as a result, I found myself making a series of financial mistakes my whole life. Everything from not opening a line of credit (I thought I was ""beating the dirty bankers"") to develop my credit score, to repeatedly overdrawing my checking account to be hit with $500 overage fees AND additional $25 late on paying the overage fees-fees (Once I owed up to $2000 without realizing and only by pleading with both the bank to reduce it to $1000 and my mom to pay it off did I escape that fiasco). And I never really learned. After moving out of the house I did get used to checking my checking account to make sure I had enough money to pay various bills and rent, though I do remember forgetting a few times and having my water shut off. Long story short I found myself an adult with no career, $80,000+ in student loan debt, and zero idea of how to progress.

Now my wife's story is about as opposite as you can get. She was born in Thailand. Her mother was from an extremely poor farming family who sometimes had one bowl of rice to share for the whole family for the day. Her dad was a little better off with a more middle class family and worked as an electrician of sorts. My wife's mother was his second marriage after he drove the first wife off and it was an arranged marriage that my wife's mother did not was to do. She has an older half sister from her father's first marriage (who is a mess) and her father did NOT want another girl, he wanted a boy. In fact her nickname to this day is ""Bee"" stemming from her being ""Plan B"" or ""If it's a boy, his name is A, if it's a girl she's B"".

That theme sort of continued while she was young. Her sister was given as much as the family could support, being the oldest, and had all the normal things like schools supplies and even had her university studies paid for by their father (she dropped out). My wife on the other hand had to make due with hand me down clothes that her mom would sew deep hems in the skirts to fit her body which she would eventually let out bit by bit as she grew. When she wanted to go to school her father told her she had to find the money herself because the family couldn't afford it.

Thankfully, her mom (basically to keep her occupied while her mom was at work) had signed her up for every athletics program under the sun from a very young age and thanks to both good academic grades and a talent for basketball she not only achieved scholarships to a college prep school but to one of the most prestigious universities in the country. She just told me to make sure that I mention how her mom had her keep a record of her spending and saving on a piece of paper ever since she got a small allowance as a little girl and learn how to cut out ""unnecessary things"" (her favorite mantra that I picked up).

While at University my wife had to struggle in the extreme as not only did her family not help with tuition, but food, housing, books, clothes, or anything else was up to her. She had to find a way to make enough money to live and study while competing both for the schools basketball and, occasionally, the schools Judo team, which any student athlete can tell you is already a full time job.

It was hard, very hard. ""The lowest point of my life"" she says. She made money by doing freelance work as a graphics designer (she majored in Animation and Graphic Design, she always wanted to learn to paint but decided she'd never make money doing that, to this day she's an amazing sketch artist and painter btw). She went for years subsiding on about $40 a month. She couldn't even afford rice to eat and had to buy bulk packs of ramen noodles which she supplemented with discount vegetables to literally not get scurvy. This whole time she watched as her family descended into chaos as her grandfather (on her dad's side) passed away and his children, her aunts and uncles fought like hyenas over an elephants carcass over the inheritance and her sister ended up stealing from her father large sums of money, ran off, got pregnant, abandoned her children and came back to continue a sad decline into drugs and bad life choices.

She graduated eventually and tried to make a living as a graphic artist in Thailand, but her dad had lost his job due to a declining mental state caused by PTSD from several brushes with Thailand's underworld while he was an electrical building inspector. So now, she had to support her father (and as a result her sister) on her own. After two years of trying in Thailand she realized she wouldn't be able to and ended up decided to leave Thailand and become and au pair to support her family. I'd like to add that through my wife I've met a lot of au pairs and their lot is utter garbage and little better than slavery in many situations and while many come from decent backgrounds just trying to make some money while they explore the wider world, most are desperate and trying to find a way to escape the poverty of their homes like my wife.

I met my wife in America. I was working as a fat, more than broke delivery driver and she was a struggling au pair working basically 24/7 (I know it's technically not, but when you live in the home you work it does it really matter if you're on the clock if the baby wakes up crying?) and making $195 a week. She sent back $350 a month to support her family and saved the rest as best she could. I had no idea how much I made or where it went aside from I hadn't had an overcharge fee in a little while.

Eventually after meeting, falling in love, and deciding to get married she eventually quit being an au pair and moved in with my and my family (after I moved back to America I moved in with my parents where I still live today) and the journey of first discovering my financial mess and fixing it began, and oh boy, what I write can only scratch the edge of the weekly ""checkups"" and arguments and lectures and stress that went into this development, it wasn't easy for either of us. She couldn't believe she'd become partners with such a disorganized mess and for me it proved to be VERY hard to learn to curb your spending when you never thought to before.

Luckily, I had ""graduated"" from being a delivery driver to working at Solar City. The first step on a long journey that eventually led to me joining the Ironworkers Union. On my development my wife showed me how to keep a physical record of every single penny I spent and earned. I would keep it up for a week, forget and loose the book then she would buy me another one and we began again. I have a closet full of about a dozen checking account books. Then she had me organize my student loans. I had no idea how much my monthly minimums were and was shocked to find out it was almost $700/mo. She taught me what interest was. These were the first steps.

I struggled, I mean really struggled to get the basic concepts of knowing where my money was at all times. Old me thought that was a waste of brain energy and it was a hard mentality to break. I'd say at least a year went by before I really understood how much I made each week/month and what my monthly expenditures were and by then I'd taken my second step in my career as a laborer working for a commercial solar company. Now I was making enough money to start paying off my loans consistently on my own (my mom had been paying part each month) even with my sloppy book keeping. This was the second biggest motivator in my life to get my sh\*t together, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that, yes I in fact could climb out of my hole myself. This and the other motivation led me to working as much overtime as possible and picking up a second job as a pizza delivery guy Friday-Sunday. I was not working more than I thought was possible (depending on overtime opportunities between 65-85 hours a week).

The main motivation though, was seeing my wife's growth no matter how many hours I worked she always ALWAYS worked more it was inspiring, exhaustin and terrifying at times to see. In my previous comment I said she'd nearly doubled her income a year, and I wasn't joking. After she left being an au pair she had to wait 6 grueling months to get her green card. It nearly drove her insane and she ended up working under the table as a cleaning lady to continue to support her family. She'd clean everything from ritsy homes in Cambdrige and Brookline to the utterly disgusting college kid housing around BC/BU/Harvard areas. She kept a paper record this whole time and is checking it now to see how much she made she made a little over $1000/month.

After she was cleared for work she continued as a cleaning lady but also got a job as a cashier, eventually a waitress at a local Vietnamese restaurant. She stopped being an au pair in January, in June she was making $1000/mo, July $1800, August $2100, September $2700, October $3000. She just read those off (I'm rounding to the nearest $100). A year later she'd left the cleaning job and started working as a waitress at a second restaurant as well as picking up shifts at David's Bridal as a seamstress, eventually maxing out at $4500/mo. In March 2018 she made $5200. This is just from pure willpower and work ethic. After going over the numbers this is where she maxes out for the present but even if it's not doubled (sorry my own exaggeration) since then this, to me, is an outstanding growth.

So watching her fight like that how could I not? I worked my bun off right next to her. She taught me to push like I never pushed before and now that I was putting in that many hours and that much effort I finally not only had the knowledge how to track my money but I had a deep desire to know where every drop of sweat was being saved or spent. I got better at accounting using Mint and my bank's online manager. I followed my 401k growth, I checked how much I was spending on gas, on work clothes, I didn't write it down like she did but I learned to keep track of everything. Nothing motivates someone knowing how much they have like knowing how hard it is to earn.

Eventually I got into the Union after years in construction. With my wife's work ethic driving my I'd garnered a reputation as a motivated and dedicated hand wherever I went. I might not be the best, but you can bet I'd be the first there and the last to leave, very few people out worked me. This reputation eventually got me noticed by a Union member and thanks to years of trying to keep up with my wife I'd grown into a much better person and while it can be very difficult to get into a Union it took one week from my first meeting to being on a jobsite with a Union outfit, riding an elevator up the biggest building I'd ever worked on (50ish stories) and up to a career that could support my own family the rest of my life. All thanks to my wife. After that I'd graduated the whole ""watch your money"" phase she taught me more, and we learned together. I started paying off my loans early in a focused way, starting with the highest interest first. I opened credit cards and used them both sparingly and paid them off each week to keep my balance low and my credit score high. I started investing in basic stocks to get a feel for the market, putting about 10% of my paycheck in as a learning cost and two years after getting into the ironworkers union I FINALLY paid off the last of my student debt. From $80,000+ to $0 all thanks to my wife's guidance and teachings.

Sorry this is an aside but it's actually funny, compared to any American construction worker I was a hungry tiger who devoured work, and it actually meant I ended up being classified less as ""one of the Americans"" but was adopted by the other class of hungry-tiger-worker in my industry: the other immigrants. Construction in any state in the US is done by Spanish immigrants, not completely but they are a constant and huge presence on any jobsite. Most I've met work like my wife. Voraciously. They came from harder lives than most can understand (An Elsalvadorian friend of mine, and the best carpenter I've ever seen, tell me how when he was 12 a guerrila army told him he was to fight with them or they'd kill his mom so he did that until a helicopter gunship killed them all so he ran and got a job loading boulders onto trucks). My motto since then has been ""Work like an immigrant, get paid like a citizen"". That last part is unfortunately since many are illegal they get taken hugely advantage of with no options.

To finish this insanely long tale: After I got in the Union my wife saw how the Union allowed minorities and women a chance to work in the trades and the benefits both in take home pay, and in benefits (Insurance, annuity, pension, vacation pay, free training) and decided she wanted to make the move, too. Ever since she was little she wanted to be like her dad, an electrician, but he told her girls couldn't do it. Now, when the opportunity presented itself she gave it her all, like she always does, and less than a year later she is the top student in her 1st year technician apprentice class and had multiple supers and foremen tell her she'll be a foreman soon, which I never doubted.

58,Would the economy collapse if everyone were smart with money?,,1705.0,f8brio,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f8brio/would_the_economy_collapse_if_everyone_were_smart/,1582475645.0,"The inspiration for this came from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f869wg/a_great_example_of_betteridges_law_of_headlines/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) which alluded to the ridiculous notion that the economy might suffer if people saved more.  Dave Ramsey sort of answers the question [in this video](https://youtu.be/HHQxXUYNc0Q) but I wanted to expand on the explanation and open a dialogue to hopefully enlighten us all.  For the sake of clarity and a simpler discussion, I'm going to leave out nuances of economics that don't change my overall argument.

I'm no economist but I did take a few econ classes in college. Whenever I encounter questions about the economy as a whole, I begin by going to the simple example of two people stranded on an island with two sources of food: fish and coconuts.  One person fishes and the other gathers coconuts.  At the end of the day, they trade and have a nice dinner.  They only need to gather what they can eat before it spoils because anything beyond that is wasted effort.  If the coconut picker harvests twice as many coconuts as needed in one day, she can take the next day off and not work.

Now let's scale the example up. Add several more people on to the island  until we have a village and each person can perform an additional task beneficial to the community such as by being a carpenter, a chef, a nanny to watch the children,  etc. Eventually, it makes sense to use a medium of exchange (money) to make trading goods and services easier.  As a bonus, money doesn't spoil as food would so it's possible for someone to save enough money to live for a month and take a whole month off work.  Or a year.  They've already put their work in.

How does investing work then?  Suppose that our coconut picker makes an investment in her coconut picking business by hiring the carpenter to build her a ladder to make it easier to pick coconuts.  She can now pick coconuts in less time than before.  Suppose she uses this extra time to further invest in her business.  She begins planting coconut trees near the village so she doesn't have to carry them from all over the island. Now she has even more free time so she begins breeding coconut trees to produce larger coconuts. Eventually she could hire someone to pick coconuts for her and she might not have to work at all.  Or she could pursue another endeavor and add even more value to the village.  The village gets the same number of coconuts as before even though she does less work.  This is the return on her investment.

In the video above, Dave Ramsey explains the fallacy in arguing that the economy would suffer if everyone were good with money.  In fact, the exact opposite is true.  The fallacy, he explains, is that the argument is predicated on the notion that in the economy if one person wins, someone else has to lose.  This is simply untrue.

In the example above, who loses when our coconut picker works extra hard and takes a day off?  Who loses when she invests in a ladder and harvests coconuts in less time?  The village still gets the same number of coconuts it always had and she has more free time.  She might relax in that free time.  Or she might work more and use the extra money to have the carpenter put an addition onto her hut.  The carpenter has more work, gets more money, and can save it or use it to invest in new tools.

Our modern economy is much more complex, but the example is still instructive.  When we invest our money, companies have the resources to improve their products and services, making them better, cheaper, or more accessible.  [This video](https://youtu.be/GnJCOof2HJk) does a great job explaining how investing in the stock market results in better/cheaper goods and services as well as additional money to the investor.  The more money we have, the more we can invest.  The more we invest, the better/cheaper goods and services get.  The better/cheaper goods and services get, the better quality of life we have and the more money we have to buy goods and services as well as to invest.  This positive feedback loop continues to advance society.  This is how we go from hunter gatherers to Macbook Pros.

So now we see how investing is helpful to boost the economy but what about savings?  Savings can help boost the economy by reducing waste in our economy.  By waste, I mean effort that is expended that isn't a net benefit to society as a whole.  For example, if you lose your job and can't pay your auto loan, then the bank will repossess your car.  The bank has to pay a repo man to find and repossess your car, the car has to go to auction, the car is then resold to someone else, the bank's accounting department needs to write off the loan, you need to find alternative transportation, etc. All of this effort wouldn't have to be expended if you had some money saved up and either continued to make payments or bought a car with cash from the beginning.  

But what about the repo man and the accountant?  They would lose their job if nobody defaulted!  Yes, they would and that would be great for everyone involved.  First, you wouldn't be in the situation where your car got repossessed so you could avoid all the stress and hassle and taxes when your loan is written off.  Also, the repo man and accountant would be free to work to create something positive for society rather than cleaning up a mess you.  What mess?  The mess that was created when you defaulted on your car note.  People who argue that argue that it would be bad if nobody defaulted because the repo man would lose his job are making an error in logic known as the [broken window fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window)  The flawed argument is that something destructive, such as breaking a window, is good for the economy because it creates a job for someone to fix the window.  But if the window does't get broken in the first place, then nobody has to fix it and everything is the same.  Taking the broken window fallacy to a logical extreme, we should all burn down our houses because it would create a lot of jobs in construction and improve the economy.  Obviously this would not be a net benefit to society!

So what would happen to the economy if everyone were smart with money?  There would be less defaulting on debts, less waste due to not having to clean up defaults, goods and services would become better and less expensive, people would be able to ride out recessions and retire earlier.",558.0,financialindependence
59,The opposite of FIRE,,1704.0,g49vt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/g49vt2/the_opposite_of_fire/,1587311481.0,"For about a decade now I have been obsessed with the concept of FIRE: how to achieve it, how to optimize it, how it affects one's life. And it was only today that I suddenly realized what the exact opposite of FIRE was--and how much better it is.

It's a pretty long-winded road, but I've been rewatching the Sopranos, and I googled the actress who plays Tony's mother: Nancy Marchand. A well respected actress, Marchand had been in the business for six decades when she got into this role, and she played it until the very end of her life, even though she was recovering from cancer at the time. This isn't the first instance I've heard of an actor going on with the show despite a terminal illness; Christopher Evan Welch of season 1 of Silicon Valley also believed the show must go on, and gave one of the best performances of that series despite his illness.

These are people who carried on working despite the fact that they were going to die soon; retirement wasn't an issue for them--their problem was the opposite. At its core, FIRE is about making the money we earn from work last as long as our lives do, although our lives are longer than our careers. In these cases, these were people who were facing the fact that their careers were lasting longer than their lives were. And they kept working to the very end.

Why? Because they *loved their work*. This is the exact opposite of the FIRE community, who, at the end of the day, are driven to leave their jobs because they hate it.

One of the pieces of advice the FIRE community loves to throw out is that young people should choose jobs not based on what they love to do but based on what makes the most money--so that they can earn as much as possible as soon as possible and get out of the rat race. But there are many cases of people hwo chose to do what they loved, and they loved it so much that they kept doing it even when the money no longer mattered, because they were going to die soon.

We should consider this--and we should consider whether the idea of just saving as much as possible and working as little is possible is truly the best way to live a good life.",467.0,financialindependence

It frames financial independence as a zero-sum game where for every winner there must be a loser. Or at least that's the concern.

It seems that at least some economists are saying that the current stock market conditions aren't the result of irrational panic but due to a real decrease in demand for non-essential goods and services.  Some estimate that as much as [40% of our economy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-coronavirus-calls-for-wartime-economic-thinking) is based on discretionary consumption.

62,The (not so) Lost Decade: Investing early and often is the easy way to make a positive gain when the market is down.,,1692.0,f5o0l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f5o0l9/the_not_so_lost_decade_investing_early_and_often/,1582010444.0,"Hey /r/financialindependence! I was honored to win the ""Best Overall Submission/Topic of 2019"" with [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/) and I wanted to follow it up with another analysis I did! If you would prefer a visual journey, you can see it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/4bx7I7v).

# The Lost Decade

The decade of the 2000s (2000-2010) was a bad stretch for the US stock market. It started with the dotcom crash and ended with the financial crisis. The share price of the S&P 500 was DOWN about 22% in 2010 from where it started in 2000. It's referred to as the lost decade because the US Stock market didn't provide a return. But that's not the whole story...

# Don't Forget Dividends

For whatever reason, almost every stock chart in the world ignores dividends. Even most interfaces on Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab only show change in share price and ignore dividend payouts. When you look at the lost decade and include dividend reinvestment the market was only down about 7%, not 22%. But even THAT'S not the whole story...

# Early and Often

When you look at a stock chart, it's kind of this fictitious example of dumping all of your money in at the beginning and letting it ride with no additional investment. But that's generally not how people invest during their wealth building phase. Many do (and more should) invest **early and often**. Sure, if you dumped all your money in the market on January 1, 2000 and waited 10 years, you'd be down by about 7%. But if you did that you would miss a big buying opportunity when the share price is low. If you look at the ""lost decade"" a different way, as investing monthly throughout, it tells a different story. 

# Making Money in a Down Market

A $500/month investment from 2000 through 2009, with dividends reinvested, would $63,912. That's about a 7% GAIN (over the $60,000 total investment) when the share price was down 22%! That worked because when the share price was low you accumulated way more shares, and that value was amplified during the recoveries.

# It Gets Better

And if you kept that $500/month going for the NEXT ten years, when the market actually recovered, your $120,000 would have turned into $348,231.

# Looking Forward

In those ""terrible"" twenty years with two catastrophic market crashes, the market returned only 6% per year. If the next twenty years look exactly the same and you keep investing $500/month, your $240,000 investment will turn into $1,353,574.‚Å£

# Net Buyers

Remember that if you are a ""net buyer"" of stock, you WANT the price to go down. Just like anything you buy, you want to pay less for it. When you're a ""net seller"" (like in retirement) then you'll want the market to go up. But if you spent your working career investing early and often, hopefully you'll have plenty. Even having made money during the terrible down years.",365.0,financialindependence

Honestly, not much has happened this year with the pandemic. My wife and 1.5 year old toddler basically stayed (and attempted to work) at home since March. Spending is pretty darn low (about 36% of our income) but we've been cooking some amazing meals. Missed some awesome vacations and have pretty much settled into a ""I never want to step into an office again"" mindset. This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on...well today(ish).

**This graph is for two people, not just me as of July 2015**

Since the last updated I've:

* Started a second Amazon Affiliate site that is now generating 2k a month with zero effort.
* Kept my toddler alive and unharmed
* Built an awesome outdoor kitchen with only the help of my wife

Some answers to common questions are below:

* This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 29 years old, live in Houston, TX and have a 1.5 year old. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference we currently have around 191k in equity in our home and owe 148k (total value of house is \~340k) . We have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. We do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good. We'll pay it off in around 3 years or so. If you include real estate we've got over a million bucks!
* We keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when we bought our first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and we bought our next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we no longer have.
* Our taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* We have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Wife bough a new car this year (ugh) but at least it was a good deal and is less than $500/mo I think. It does not impact our savings rates.
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -> 74K promotion ->97k old job -> 115k current job)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -> 84k promotion -> 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-> max IRA's -> invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -> pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",499.0,financialindependence

The news is in, we are down over $60,000 this month. Sounds pretty bad right?

Well I updated my projection charts with my new net worth, and well this has pushed my FIRE date out by a whole *3 months*!

Interestingly, each additional $370 spend per year forever pushes my FIRE date out 1 month. 

So the impact of the market drawdown is equal to additional expenses of $92.50 per month.

Every day people tack on these little extra expenses (car lease, gym membership, food delivery service) and they don't lose their shit over their lifestyle inflation, while the impact is the same as a global pandemic.

On the bright side, this also means that if I can cut $93 of monthly spend from my budget, I'd completely offset this tragedy in my FIRE journey. I can easily do that by cooking more, or biking to work, or some combination of both.

Compared with chests of jewels, precious metals and tangible wealth centuries ago... a few commas on a screen doesn't have quite the same panache!

So, for every $100,000 I've added to my net worth, I purchase a 1oz Fine Silver dollar minted that year. I call it a ""Freedom Chip"";  a little piece of the freedom I'll have once I collect enough chips. They are relatively cheap ($20-$30) and as a precious metal, are conceptually representative of wealth itself. The goal here is not to actually invest in precious metals, but just to serve as a ""souvenir"" along the financial journey. They're a big coin, relatively heavy, and satisfying to hold and think of as each representative of $100k. When I hit my FIRE number, I'll get a pure gold coin and make a nice leather pouch to jangle them around in.

* June - Got first promotion and was now making about $1700 a month.
* July - Took a loan out and purchased a used Honda Accord for $9000.
* August - Began to start actively saving and investing. Started 5% matching into TSP which is the kind of like the military's 401K. Also began to invest a couple hundred each paycheck into Robinhood buying random stock, though I lost more doing this than I gained.
* November - Totaled my car, and thought I was going to be screwed on the amount I would get from insurance. The other party claimed injuries and for months I was certain I was going to have to come up with a fortune because of the accident. Luckily my insurance fully paid off my loan and left some over for another car, as well as covering the other parties injuries and vehicle. (Shout out USAA)

The military began providing $2950 extra a month for food, housing, other pays because of this. I was now making about $4450 a month, but now had to find my own housing and food.
* February - Buy a used care using insurance money. Also began renting a room for $850 a month and pocketed the remainder of my housing allowance. 
* March - Promoted to next rank. Taking home about $4600 a month. Opened IRA with Vanguard. About this time I made a goal to have $50,000 and no debt when my contract ended in 2020.

1. Life is precious and youth is fleeting. 

Take time off while you're still relatively young and adventurous. I was a little bit past my 40th birthday but still had a lot of my energy and was in great shape which paid off as I did many physical activities I won't be able to do when I'm older. 

2  Quitting work forever may not be for you. 

After a few months of travel, I grew a bit restless and wanted to come home and achieve great things again. Taking time off re-energized me and created a thirst to learn new things. I worked for the same company but eventually left and I've achieved things at my new company I could only dream of before. I also realized I wasn't ready to quit work completely. I still like the feeling of accomplishment and winning.

Notes: 

* Taxes include federal, state (NY) and property tax (~$3k)

* 2005 was a partial income year. I graduated in May and started working immediately.

* 2020 data is extrapolated / estimated

* The charts are the result of mining my financial and tax records to put the story together. I hadn‚Äôt been monitoring my NW until last year.



2005: Graduated college - I only had about $40k in school loans when I graduated in 2005. People graduating today won‚Äôt have it quite as easy since tuition doubled (at my school; others have more than doubled). But you can still do some of the things I did to minimize expenses. First, go to a community college for the first two year and then transfer to university after that. This essentially cut my tuition in at least half. Plus, I lived with my parents in those two year and saved on room and board. Also, when I went away to university, I lived off campus in an apartment with friends. This ended up being cheaper and more fun.


2006: Purchased home for $61k ‚Äì It‚Äôs a modest home in a LCOL area. This was a tough decision at the time because I could have afforded much more. But I am glad I didn‚Äôt make myself house poor. The house had everything I needed, and I enjoyed doing affordable upgrades.

In the years to follow, I would contribute to 401K up to my company match, max out Roth IRA and the rest would go to debt. A financially savvy person wouldn‚Äôt have paid off my mortgage so quickly. But given the crappy stock market performance in those years, and relatively small loan, I am not sure it made much difference.


2011: Mortgage was paid off

For the next 8 years I was on auto pilot. I was single and spent a lot of time working. Didn‚Äôt increase my spending much at all and my increases in salary went to savings. 

I still enjoyed life, traveled whenever the opportunity came up, and did little things like having my shirts dry-cleaned (because I hate ironing).  But otherwise didn‚Äôt spend a lot of money on material things. 


2019: I found this sub and started looking at my finances closer. Before this, I hadn‚Äôt every added everything up to determine my net worth. I knew I was in a good spot, but was pleasantly surprised to see my net worth over $800k at that point, then watched it cross $1M at the end of 2019 (when I included my home equity). The really great thing though, was when the market tanked after covid, I was knowledgeable enough that it didn‚Äôt faze me at all. I knew the market would go back up and it did. 


A few changes I made after becoming more financially educated:

* Set a FI goal and started a spreadsheet to track progress

* Changed my Roth 401k contributions to Traditional (should have done this years ago)

* Started mega backdoor Roth IRA contributions

* Put the $100k from my High Yield Savings (HYS) into the market 



That‚Äôs about all I have to say.

I know my favorite posts in the subreddit are the ones that include all the raw details so i‚Äôll do my best to include the relevant information.

Quick recap: 32 year old couple in the SF Bay area both working at ‚ÄúFAANG‚Äù companies in non-engineering tech roles (ie Senior Data Science Manager for me) and our plan is to be able to retire by 35 but am currently a few years of schedule (wasn‚Äôt the case 3 months ago so I take that with a grain of salt).  Earning fairly ‚ÄúFat‚Äù bay area salaries but have more modest spend goals in retirement \~75K (excluding housing).  I debated whether I should update this year since it feels strange posting mid-pandemic but felt it would be helpful for others to see how crazy the swings can be and how unpredictable rebounds can be (see charts below).  

We both graduated in the middle of the great recession with non-STEM liberal arts degrees (economics) from state colleges. I wanted to go into banking but the career fairs at my university in florida were spartan. Friends with top honors were getting their offers rescinded from the key players and I couldn‚Äôt even land an interview.  Luckily found opportunities at local tech start ups and two jobs later was recruited to the Bay Area for nearly the same base adjusted for COL but clearly much more upside (full base salary history at the end).

While 2020 has been rough trapped in a yardless apartment with an active toddler we are fortunate enough to both have remained employed (knock on wood).  Covid also tossed in another interesting future option around longer term remote work outside the bay while maintaining \~90% of bay area salaries.  So my original plan was to FIRE at 35 could turn into more of a glide out (really wanting to get out of the Bay Area ahead of my toddler starting elementary school).

**Overall Investment Value as of 8/7**:  $2.3M, +54% YoY  (prev. 1.75M)

* 290k from new contributions (large chunk from liquidity event)
* 260k from gains + dividends
* Current Asset Allocation: 53/33/14 (Domestic/International/Bond) 100% in low cost index funds
* Account Split: 57% Taxable (normal broker), 30% Pre-Tax (traditional 401k), 13% Post-Tax (roth) 
* This is the majority of my networth.  I own zero property, no vehicles, no debt of any type.  Have an additional 300k in savings

I am nearly at $70k @ 3% withdraw rate today but still need another 2 years for the next two bullets (might also just bump up target to around 100k‚Ä¶ have flexibility here and 1-more year syndrome is very real).  Current spending is \~12k per month of which 70% is housing and childcare.
* \~500k available for house purchase in MCOL city; something like a Portland, Nashville, Austin, I am originally from Florida‚Ä¶ so not there.  Need to do more research on full tax treatment and public schools (ie TX has no income tax but high property tax so could be worse off than states with higher income taxes).

**Income:**

* Base Income:  $400k \~6% Increase (includes my partner, yes i know this is ridiculous)
* Equity: $300k (1-time step change due to liquidity event but equity has also seen large gains in both new grants and company stock value over the past year, expecting at least the same for the next year but very much depends on company performance)

74,The principles I learned in 7 years here,,1549.0,ji1r8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ji1r8p/the_principles_i_learned_in_7_years_here/,1603661859.0,"I've learned *a lot* by surfing these subs.  I internalized it and am really happy with where I am.  I wanted to take a minute to pay it forward and distill what I've internalized into first principles.

First, a bit on my background.  I was always interested in being FI and know that money doesn't equal freedom, but it is an aspect of freedom (if nothing else, freedom from worrying about meeting basic needs).  I was saving heavily in my mid 20's but was also working for a nonprofit.  I was saving 50% of my income but it honestly wasn't amounting to all that much.

I wound up spending about a year teaching myself data science before and after work.  I was really motivated by the field and, luckily for me, it turns out to be quite lucrative.  I also started skydiving.  That meant moving to a shared 1 bedroom apartment with somebody I butted heads with so I could afford it and not overly sacrifice savings goals.   That was a tough call because skydiving is expensive, but it also made me much more risk tolerant and a generally happier and less reactive human.  Skydiving taught me that most of my fears were unfounded (evolution predisposes you to fear more than you have to) so I geared up for a big life change.

When I was good enough at data science, I quit my job in the nonprofit and moved to San Francisco to do a 3 month bootcamp program.  Everybody thought I was nuts.  That drained my savings virtually down to the last dime (with no debt though).  I got my first job in the industry making very little money in a role where I would learn a lot.  I loved it and got a promotion in (I shit you not) 2 weeks of being on the job.  That was my first 6 figure income.

Zoom forward four years and I'm at a major company with a significant equity stake, financially comfortable, and having just bought a home.  Not quite yet FIRE but getting close depending on how my company stock does.

Obviously everybody's path is different.  But principles are more universal.  With all that, here are the main principles that lead to my success:

1. *Find the global maximum*.  I was top of my game in that nonprofit with a relatively good income and title, but I was growing unhappy and knew I wouldn't make my longterm goals.  It was a tough call to quit, drain my savings, and move.  But I did it and now I feel like I'm in a global personal maximum for life satisfaction, earning, etc.  This means longterm thinking
2. *Stay balanced.*  I almost burned myself out on FIRE multiple times.  I started seeing everything as costs.  Be scrappy on everything but what makes you most come alive.   That's crucial for longterm motivation
3. *The best investments are always in yourself.*  Active recovery, eduction, socializing, etc. are the best investments you can make.  They're bad investments on the short term but great on the longterm
4. *Save on housing until you're ready to purchase a home.*   My rule was that  I'd live with roommates until I had enough for a down payment.  When covid happened, I decided I wouldn't buy a place until the market rebounded so I let my investments sit until they rebounded, sold, and purchased a home.  Most people lose too much money on housing
5. *Never pay interest.*  This is an exaggeration but it's the biggest lifetime expense for more people.  I pay some interest but both my small car loan and mortgage are below 3% interest.  That means, with inflation, my money is likely better in the stock market than paying back those loans.  So apart from that interest, I've been lucky enough to manage to avoid it like the plague
6. *Take risks and experiment.*  Most people are way too risk adverse, scared to place strategic bets.  I've lost a lot of money on risky things but have gained so much more in experience.  Spending thousands on bitcoin miners in the early days while on a shoestring budget?  Lost a lot on that.  But it resulted in learning an appropriate way to buy crypto and the net effect was many more thousands of dollars in gains
7. *Have mentors/models.*  If you don't do this explicitly, you default to modeling your behavior on whoever is around you.  Think of who your top models for behavior are (financial, relationship, etc) and figure out what makes them tick.  For me it was Mr. Money Moustache, some abundance-oriented technology thought leaders, and some anti-consumer friends who were militant about how owning things doesn't make you happy
8. *Don't defer pleasure.*  I came to realize that many of my thoughts on retirement were quite Catholic (thanks, dad).  In other words, I was deferring pleasure until retirement like my Catholic father was deferring pleasure until the afterlife.  Be fiercely present and enjoy today.  Finances are only one part of life satisfaction
9. *Have an abundance and growth mindset.*  Most people think of money as a scarce resource.  It's not.  Anybody can generate it given enough time and effort.  Think big picture and work incrementally towards it rather than accepting the career progression of your peers or employer.  Most people underestimate how much employers will recognize a strong sense of drive and personal responsibility
10. *Change is necessary.*  For the Buddhists, that's the source of all suffering.  Do we want to sacrifice the mediocre reality today for the option of a better reality tomorrow?  Most people are so change and uncertainty adverse they can't adapt to more beneficial situations.  Being open and curious and optimistic about change is necessary, otherwise the mediocre today seems like a better bet or you'll change and then quickly regress.  The opportunity cost for change is whatever situation you currently find yourself in.  Make sure you're ok with this and have the confidence to course correct if you get in over your head

*TL;DR - Reality is malleable.  You can achieve whatever you want as long as you take a step back, strategize, and then kick some ass.  If you adopt some principles and play the long game, you'll ace this whole life thing*

The line that struck me: **""The FIRE community underscores this point: We don't really need lots of relaxation. What we need is interesting, meaningful, hard activity.""**

My SO and I have been talking a ton about what we want to do after we hit FI (anywhere from 3-7 years depending on how well our business does). The common theme is that we don't want to do *nothing*. As a marketer, I have podcast and newsletter ideas I'd like to get off the ground. I've also considered trading my time (strategy calls and consulting) in exchange for donations to a charity. 

Cal talks also talks about hard activity for its own sake, like Frugalwoods' homesteading or Mr. Money Mustache pouring concrete. 

I wanted to pose this question to the community: **what's the ultimate goal for your FI?**

Cal seems to have found most of the FIRE community is focused on these hard, meaningful projects. But I know plenty of us talk about getting through 100 video games or traveling. I'm tempted to go sit on a beach in Costa Rica.

The decrease in stress though feels great. Almost no one knows my financial situation, so came here to get a release. 

Path : I graduated from University in 1998 and joined a small hardware tech start-up right out of school. The company did well through the tech bust, I pushed to get as much equity as possible, and for a brief period I was worth (on paper) nearly $2M as a 23 year old. It unraveled quickly though and in the end I only cashed out a little more than a down payment on my home.

Later went on to work for a mega-corp‚Äôish company that I had been working at for over a decade. Had my ups and downs there. Made them boatloads of money. Often liked what I was working on, but hated the corporate politics and bureaucracy. It only got worse over the years and eventually just gave up on trying to advance. Was interesting that my co-workers reaction to my resignation was a fairly equal mix of disbelief of leaving a cushy job without something else lined up during a pandemic and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you lasted as long as you did‚Äù.

I saved over all the years, but lost some focus on the savings during the middle part. But as work became less enjoyable I doubled down on the FI path. 

Stats :

Single. Early forties. HCOL city, but bought in early and small. 

Net Worth : ~$2.75M

Investments : ~$2.35M

~$1.5M taxable
~$800k 401k/Trad
~$75k Roth 

Home Equity : ~$400k with $15k left on mortgage

Currently at ~67% equity (70/30 US/Intl) and ~33% fixed income with a nice pile of cash to hold me over a couple of years if need be. Plan to glide-path back to 80% equities over the next decade which is where I‚Äôve been for most of the journey. Vast majority of investments in low-cost index funds, some small single company holdings, and a little bit of active (especially for bonds) in retirement accounts. 

Biggest mistakes I made along the way :

Not automating my taxable investing earlier

Not utilizing HSA and backdoor Roth earlier

Sitting on too much cash along the way, though that had piece of mind benefits

I‚Äôve been easily spending <$60k a year including mortgage. Was kind of hoping to have the mortgage paid off when I quit, but it will be shortly and for now what was budgeted for travel is going to that. Hoping to not go too much higher than this with new health costs added in. Will be threading the needle of income between Roth conversions, ACA subsidy, and keeping overall tax rate as low as possible. 

I‚Äôve travelled extensively over the years (thank you miles/points from credit card bonuses and work travel) and plan to continue once the Covid craziness dies down but at a much slower and likely cheaper pace. Might go full nomad at some point, we shall see.

I‚Äôm most focused right now on living a healthier life. But I‚Äôve also started working on some small business ideas with low start-up costs that hopefully could go into semi auto mode if they take off. I‚Äôm looking at any income I can bring in to just up the travel budget. Also will be volunteering (virtually right now) for some causes I believe in.

78,You‚Äôre probably closer to independence than you realize,,1516.0,iawqq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iawqq1/youre_probably_closer_to_independence_than_you/,1597599910.0,"Financial Independence, as most spreadsheets frame the idea, is the art of replacing your spending with investment returns. More quietly stated is an implicit promise that after you‚Äôve done it, you‚Äôre free. Chasing that freedom is an incredible motivator if you‚Äôre anything like me. And you‚Äôre probably at least a little like me, if you‚Äôre on this subreddit.

Except, of course, we all know you‚Äôre never completely free. 

The outside requirements on a human life don‚Äôt stop at the financial. You still have to go to the doctors office to make sure your body is running OK. You need to take out the trash. Your desk gets messy and you have to clean it up. You feel guilty if you forget send your mom a card on her birthday. You‚Äôre not free, you‚Äôre still a human being. Just a human being with a lot of flexibility. 

And, of course, once most people do the math, it becomes clear that in order to get spending low enough to make it work, your part time job effectively becomes frugality. 

Being frugal isn‚Äôt a terrible part time job. You autonomously set your own schedule, it gives you an opportunity to be creative, you develop skills which have an impact on your life, such as gardening and thrifting. Frugality challenges your comfort levels at times, which in turn allows you appreciate luxury when it‚Äôs available.  For me, it‚Äôs pretty much the checklist for what counts as an incredibly satisfying job. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem with any of this. And as a thoughtful person who‚Äôs put some brain time into designing your life, you already implicitly know everything I‚Äôm saying. But it‚Äôs useful to say explicitly. 

I sat down this week to write a plan for what I would do if I lost my job tomorrow, and was barred from full time employment for the rest of my life. 

I was not shocked to discover that even without 100% FI savings, I could design several options for lifestyles where my FI goals of satisfying work, low stress, extreme autonomy, meaningful relationships, and security were accessible.  But what I was shocked to discover was that I could also design such a life without relying on any of my considerable savings or investments at all. The savings and investments made it a lot easier, but they really weren‚Äôt necessary.

It turns out the important part of this thought exercise was forcing myself to give up my current job. With that, I had to get rid of my own internal limiters: the unconscious need to project success to peers, the fear of giving up what I‚Äôve already worked for in my current job, the iron clad spreadsheet and financial plan that I‚Äôve been faithfully following for seven years, the fear of something new.

When all that creativity was being pointed towards the actual life goals, as opposed to purely the financial goals that I thought would help with the life goals, a lot of shortcuts became apparent. And I couldn't have done it without having put a tremendous amount of thought into clarifying what, exactly, I want out of life. 

Of course, I‚Äôm not quitting my job immediately. And it‚Äôs not like my current lifestyle is too far of a cry from my goal lifestyle. It has a little less autonomy than I‚Äôd like, and a little more stress, but we‚Äôre in the ballpark. 

But the lesson that I think is important to remember is that financial goals are easy to measure, easy to track, and easy to let swallow you to the point of distraction. Life is not a binary between FI and failure. Extreme saving is a tool, and only a tool, and it‚Äôs worth putting thought into what you need that tool for, and not just how to get your hands on it.",334.0,financialindependence
79,[UPDATE] $500k the boring way,,1512.0,k8it0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8it0c/update_500k_the_boring_way/,1607355448.0,"This is an update of my previous post, [‚Äú$250k the boring way‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/) and my original post, [""$100k the boring way""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/). I‚Äôll recap as best I can but all the details are in those if you're interested.

**Summary**

Reached $500k (now $600k, sorry I'm lazy) net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 8 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Quick Recap** **^(that keeps getting longer am I getting old)**

My wife and I are both 32 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I‚Äôm an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $250k net worth we:

* Both got graduate degrees.
* Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
* Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $116k for me and $54k to $80k for my wife.
* Had a baby and wife took some unpaid time.
* Bought a house

**Updates**

Second half of 2019: Nothing really happened financially but we did take a family vacay to NZ and Fiji for 2 weeks. Somehow made it work taking a 1.5 year old halfway across the world and can't say enough about how much I would recommend both places. Can't say it was always relaxing but I would do it again. Also found out we were going to be having another baby.

In the last update my job had just added on-call pay. I ended up with about $5k of this bringing me to $121k total compensation.

2020: Our son was born in early March right as the pandemic was lifting off. I still haven't decided if this was a great time to have a baby or a horrible time. Financially, our timing was (purposely) a lot better with the school schedule and combined with a new maternity leave policy at my wife's job, she didn't have to take any unpaid leave this time around.

At my job, I got another 5% merit raise plus COLA increase bringing me to my current base salary of $126k. Looks like I'm on track for another $5k of on-call pay on top of that. My company went all remote so I haven't been back to the office since the day my wife went into labor. I'm liking the work from home situation a lot and expect that I will be WFH at least 2 days a week once the office is open again.

We refinanced our house in the spring from a 30yr 4.5% down to a 20yr 3.25% loan which increased our monthly payment but saves us an estimated $120k over the life of the loan, so that's nice. I'm actually working on another refi right now to get down to 20yr 2.875% to save an additional $30k. I imagine I'll call it good here but hey you never know.

This fall when school resumed, we made the decision to drop my wife down to part-time. This has been our plan from the beginning: work 5 years to qualify for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program and then go to just 3 days a week in order to have more time for family but still accrue full years towards the pension.

On that note, we applied for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program in June as soon as my wife's 5th year had ended. Our application was rejected by our servicer Nelnet 3 times before being sent on to the Dept. of Education in September. It was a very slow and frustrating process but ultimately was worth the hard work, as we found out just last week that it was approved and $17.5k was instantly removed from our balance. I got a lot of questions on this program last time - all the details can be found [here](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher). We have just $10k of loans left now that we will let sit there until they start accruing interest again or are forgiven by the new administration.

**Chart**

[Here is our financial journey summed up in one line](https://imgur.com/VDa8UcH). It's definitely starting to look like more of a curve now. The inflection points that used to stand out just kind of look like noise now, so here are the relevant dates in list form:

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
3. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
4. 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
5. 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.
6. 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.
7. 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.
8. 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.

**Current Finances**

* $90k e-fund, $5k in an HSA.
* $326k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* $189k equity in our home
* \-$10k of student loans remaining
* Current savings rate is down to 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies.
* Monthly expenses have gone up quite a bit, looking like our budget is about $7k which seems crazy to me. Luckily daycare isn't forever I guess.

**Thoughts**

Salary

I mentioned in my last update that I was closing in on the salary cap in my current position. At the end of this upcoming January I will get like a 1% raise and be maxed in my band. Unfortunately to go higher means I would likely need to take on a supervisory role, and I'm not sure yet if that's something I want. I've been doing all the required trainings for that just in case but I really like the position I'm in now so no rush I think.

Now What

Student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. For 8 years now they have weighed on me, sometimes heavily (and that's even with knowing that our career choices meant we would be okay and get them paid off eventually). The loan forgiveness was something we carefully planned for. It's definitely a weird feeling to be essentially student debt-free after pouring so much time, money and energy into dealing with them. Luckily I can fill this void with a very long to-do list.

Near term, I need to put a priority on making a will for us and making sure all of the stuff related to that is in order. Along those same lines I'd like to get some extra life insurance going besides just the basic coverage we get from work automatically. Still haven't put a lot of thought into our strategy for saving for college. We are likely buying a minivan (please give me all your minivan tips and recommendations) in the next couple months. Longer term, we have started talking about what a home upgrade might look like for us.

**The End**

My third update (at least to me) seems even more boring than ever. Having a new baby and navigating the pandemic at the same time meant that in the past 9 months I really haven't had much time or energy to think about saving, spending, or retirement so it all just sort of happened on its own. Before preparing to make this update I hadn't logged in to categorize our transactions since June which is crazy for me. I basically stopped coming to this sub vs being a daily reader. I'm most definitely in ""the boring middle"" now.

In the last update I had said ""The financial peace of mind is extremely valuable to us as we navigate the wonderful and scary world of parenting"". Well since then, we doubled down on the parenting and added a global pandemic on top. We are extremely fortunate to still have our jobs and our health, and I don't take that for granted. To not really ""worry"" about money during this time is a luxury to be sure, but one that we worked hard for. 

Thanks for reading, everyone. Back to saving now. See you at the $1M update!",368.0,financialindependence
80,"Today is the day! With thoughts, numbers, and graphs [M 38]",,1506.0,hx6jj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hx6jj1/today_is_the_day_with_thoughts_numbers_and_graphs/,1595613371.0,"After 16+ years of employment, today is the day. I‚Äôve hit my goal, I‚Äôm packing up my desk and leaving my job. In retrospect, my FIRE reddit user name feels  short-sighted...

**What FIRE means to me:**

I‚Äôve been working on this goal basically from the start of employment, well before I heard the term FIRE. I‚Äôve always been frugal and very interested in being financially independent allowing myself to work on my own independent projects. As a result, I‚Äôm viewing this more as financial independence, than retirement. I‚Äôm still a driven individual who wants to work on ideas/projects, but now I have the ability to take risks, work on what I find interesting, and ultimately I can fail on these projects. In addition. I also have the ability to take the time off giving me more time to travel and work on hobbies.

**The numbers:**

I‚Äôm 38, single, and my goal was to have roughly 75k USD a year (after taxes). After doing a lot of research and number crunching, the withdraw rate I felt comfortable using was 3.3%. That means my net worth target was 2.5 million.

Here is a graph of my net worth over time: [https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG](https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG). The first graph is tracking just my personal investment starting with 2008 as I didn‚Äôt track my retirement accounts over time until many years later.

It took me 10 years of working to hit the 500k mark, and then roughly 6 more years to hit my 2.5 target. It‚Äôs crazy how momentum builds in the later years.

**Allocation and performance:**

Here is a rough breakdown on how I invested my money

* 45% S&P 500 and growth index
* 10% Tech funds
* 15% International
* 15% Small cap
* 10% Speculation individual investments
* 5% Bonds

As you can see, I was a bit different from the ""tried and true"" FIRE strategy. I work in Tech and felt that will be the most influential industry as time moves forward. In addition, starting in 2012 I wanted some money set aside for individual investment, offering a bit higher risk/reward.

For the speculative investments, I only put money in growth companies I felt confident in never pulling out and that would continue to grow and change society. I also ensured that I felt they had a high barrier of entry for competition. These all ended up being tech companies. The majority of this discretionary amount was put into Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla. The first 2 of those have done quite well over the years. And my one potential flop, Tesla, has clearly exploded the last year. So I am quite fortunate and lucky these individual investments have done so well. And while they make up 10% of my initial investment, they make up 25% of my overall private worth now. With these, my allocation has out performed the S&P500 over the years by a decent amount.

And last, you will notice on the graphs that my 401k earnings did way worse than my private portfolio (or the S&P500). The offered funds had higher expense ratios, worse performance, and while I had a similar allocation to my private interments, it did significantly worse.

**Lessons learned along the way:**

2008 ‚Äì This was the big one. I was lucky to have paid off my debts and just start investing in 2007, before the 2008 crisis hit. I learned a lot from that mess. When the 2008 crisis hit, I took my money out of the market after a 40% loss. Based on those results, I was frustrated and I decided to a large amount of the remaining money and put 35,000 towards a car in cash (missing the 2009 rally). Paying cash for the car seemed like the financially correct thing to do ‚Äì Had I financed, that money in my portfolio would now be worth 130,000ish. While this seemed very costly at the time, learning this lesson early saved me much more in future mistakes. When this 2020 market dip happened, I remained cool, left my money where it was. At the end of Q2, I‚Äôm up 10% on the year. The amount of stories I read on people still with the money out of the market after this recovery, missing 40% recovery, hit home as the lesson I learned in 2008.

Advise from people on what is happening in the market ‚Äì As I read investment analysis over the years on what the market will do, I learned that for the most part, no one knows shit about the future (myself included). I made a point to write down what the sentiment was and check 6 months later where things stood, it was wrong far more than it was correct. People in general are very emotional and overreact, I‚Äôm still shocked in how the market over reacts and then settles. I kept plugging in money constantly along the way, and that has worked.

**My take-always:**

* Don‚Äôt try and time the market 	(duh, but I had to learn it)
* You are playing a long game, don‚Äôt 	get scared and take money out as the market falls
* If you can, continuing to invest after a market fall is key. It's important have the emergency fund to help limit down-market hardships preventing investment.

**The FIRE plan now that I‚Äôve triggered:**

As I said, my safe withdrawal rate is 3.3%. Some CAPE >30 models show that having odds of failing over a 50 year period, but I am OK with that smaller amount of risk. I also feel that past result of CAPE ratios wont have the same results as they will now. The market and fed reserve tools are evolving. Clearly this is totally speculation.

I‚Äôve reallocated money so I have essentially 2.5 years of living money in bonds/cash. I‚Äôm taking a the approach where I will live off dividends and sold allocations in good and neutral performing years. When market years are bad, I will live off withdrawn bond money, and will be reinvesting dividends. I will then be replenishing the bond money after the market has pulled out of the recession.

I plan to continue living in a Medium cost of living city in the US. Being single - living in a good city environment with easy access to people, hobbies, and having a good place to work on my projects in paramount. I was debating moving internationally, but now doesn‚Äôt seem to be a good time to consider that, I will reevaluate that in future years.

**Conclusion:**

So that is it, hopefully this write-up is helpful to someone. It's certainly been valuable to gather my thoughts.

It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúhit me‚Äù yet that I‚Äôve made it. I‚Äôm nervous and excited for what is to come. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. If you think I‚Äôm overlooking something, let me know. I‚Äôm always evolving my plan and considering feedback is the best tool I have for refining. I‚Äôll look to do a 1 year update next year.",426.0,financialindependence
81,Millennials: Have the two recessions of our generation pushed you towards FI?,,1497.0,hxnwzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hxnwzm/millennials_have_the_two_recessions_of_our/,1595688562.0,"Newbie here, came over from r/personalfinance. 

Due to the pandemic and economic slowdown, my almost-63 year old father was recently laid off from his engineering firm. He's in good enough financial shape that while, even though he was planning on working until 65, he's probably not going to look too hard for another job. Fortunately my mother has been a public employee nearly her entire career so has a nice pension, and they've generally made solid financial decisions so they'll be fine. My dad also faced pay cuts during the 2008 recession, but did not lose his job at that point.

Watching them go through this experience has pushed me more towards the goal of retiring by the time I'm 60 (or at least have the option). I keep hearing about the struggles people in their 50s and 60s have to find new jobs if laid off, and recessions only make that more difficult. Going through two recessions/economic slowdowns (not sure if we're technically in a ""recession"" yet this time) before I'm 35, I want to do whatever I can to set myself up for security for the future. I'd hate to be 61/62, lose my job and feel forced into a job I hated or not be able to find anything at all.

Just curious if other Millennials have had similar thoughts on early retirement based on the economic landscape of our early career years?",517.0,financialindependence

## My lessons learned?
- Look for a meaningful life, always
- but health first
- Time is precious
- Challenges make me alive
- Be happy
- Have savings
- Money is temporary, spend wisely
- B2B business is hard. Relationships help a lot



## Intro
2007 -  I‚Äôd been working for 10 years in Brazil, mainly as a software engineer and tech lead for a few different software development agencies.

Hectic environment was the norm. 250+ hours/month for 4 months, no weekends, no exercises. I was like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young, I can do all of it‚Äù.


## Problem
Then, all of the sudden, I felt an irregular heart rate. I felt my heart beating faster for 2 days. This situation led me to a hospital visit. Burnt out detected. I was told to reduce workload. At least, my heart and everything else was completely fine.

***This problem would change my mindset forever.***


## Solution
Worrying about my life, I left the company and planned to spend 1 year taking care of myself, no work at all. (At the time I was living at home, no kids, 2 years of savings, which facilitated my decision)

## My new mindset
- I will never work as many hours as before
- I will not worry about work as much as I will about my health


## What did I do next?
2 months into my ‚Äúforced sabbatical‚Äù. Got a call from a former colleague: a job proposal. ‚ÄúNO, I‚Äôll stay 1 year off work‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow about doing a contract, working from home, at your own time?‚Äù I sent my proposal, considering 8hrs/day, higher rates and extended delivery dates. ‚ÄúOk, agreed‚Äù.

Fast forwarding some years, I co-created a B2B product (similar to QlikView and GeckoBoard) at my own pace (10 months), without pressures (working normal hours). Took us 10 months to strike the first sale!


## Company of One
I ran the company for 9 years:

- 3 co-founders, I was the only one - working full time
- 4 clients only
- 4 employees
- All projects had realistic deadlines. We wouldn't allow pressure from clients to deliver earlier
- No extra hours
- Flexible time, we mostly could work whenever and wherever we wanted to, following the deliverables

All of it also allowed me to work less hours and enjoy the chased freedom. **We were thriving.**


## Finally, the dreamed life
Everything was running accordingly. No long hours. Holidays abroad. Time to exercise. Low 7 figures revenue. Great profit. Highly efficient employees. The dreamed life had arrived! To make it even better, I received an offer and sold my company for something in the north of 7 times my yearly earnings.


## Moving abroad
With money on hand was time for us (my wife and I) to take the biggest decision of our lives: to move abroad, from the hot and sunny Brazil to London (I‚Äôll write another post with the reasons we decided to move).


## I‚Äôm on top of the world
Now, I have all the time I wished for. I can travel a lot. I don‚Äôt need to work. I‚Äôm successful, anything I launch will be profitable. I know how to make money. 

Then I travelled. I didn‚Äôt look for a new job at all. I invested my time in side-projects as diverse as a list of transport options from airports to city centres. List of UK beers. List of videogame‚Äôs musics.


## Is everything going according to the plan?
Well, my new lifestyle was not bringing me real happiness. **Having anything I dreamed of without any clear purpose was meaningless.**

Adding to this, my side-projects were not helping anyone. **This made me realise I wasn't as invincible as I arrogantly had thought.**


## The meaning of my life
One of the purposes of our moving abroad, was to raise kids in a safer country, with less problematic politics. Then, sticking to the original plan, it was time to have a baby. He was born 2 years after I started my dreamed, empty life.

Since then, I'm one of the most important people in the world, at least for him. My life now has the most clear objectives, most difficult challenges and the best rewards ever: 
- **to make him as happy as possible. If he‚Äôs happy, I‚Äôm more than happy** 

- **to raise him without any prejudiced views**

- **and many, many more**

**Now, I‚Äôm on top of the world.**

## My today‚Äôs world
Since 2018 I'm working as a Project Manager/Product Owner after 12 years as an employer. 

Why? My mind needs to be active (empty mind sucks). It makes me feel alive. I need the income. 

There are loads of positive points now, like 25 days of holidays, clear direction, having a boss to learn from, working in an industry I‚Äôm passionate about (sports), career progression, etc.

## My future
I‚Äôm chasing the dream, once again, of launching something that helps people. Why? 
- to see the real joy of helping people solve their problems
- to spend quality time with my family. This time will never come back
- to have the freedom to work whenever and wherever I‚Äôm the most productive
- To feel the rush when a new client buys my product

Now, I‚Äôm 100% sure I‚Äôm using my time and money way more wisely than before.",280.0,financialindependence
83,[meta] downsides of the 'Daily FI discussion thread' model,,1472.0,f6frqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f6frqe/meta_downsides_of_the_daily_fi_discussion_thread/,1582139995.0,"Hello all,

I've noticed that despite having over 700,000 readers, this sub only gets about 5-8 posts per day‚Äîan extremely low rate of posting for how many people are here.

Instead, virtually all discussion gets locked up in the daily discussion threads, which tend to get about 700 to 1000 comments each.

I feel this makes it very difficult to browse, as the daily thread post titles indicate nothing about what's in the comments. It also makes search almost totally useless, as reddit's search only looks at submissions, not comments.

In other words, this is a poor way to organize content. The stated purpose of daily threads is for anything that 'doesn't warrant its own post', but that has resulted in the vast majority of all discussion getting clumped into a few posts‚Äîeven hundreds of topics that *could* warrant their own threads, but are instead buried in a vast ocean of comments on a single post.

For example on today's daily thread, there was an interesting string of comment asking about Traditional vs Roth TSPs. But guess what? That sub-thread is going to be completely undiscoverable in the future (at least using reddit search).

Suggested alternatives:

* Loosen, in some way, what qualifies for its own thread
* Choose weekly discussion topics to help group comments around a certain topic together.
* Along with the previous bullet, a meta thread could be maintained to help the community brainstorm topics they'd like to see discussed.",391.0,financialindependence

I saw that I officially became a member of the two comma (or dot/space) club. How does it feel? To be honest, it feels exactly the same as it did when my NW still had one comma. 

I don‚Äôt make six or seven figures. I don‚Äôt have any crypto. Not a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or other high earner. I still make a five figure base salary as I did when I got my first ‚Äúreal paying‚Äù job.  For the curious, mostly admin office stuff, new media, and resource mgmt).  20s underemployed and drowning in med bills, yada, yada, yada.

My allocation is approx. 34%ish 401k, 52%ish 3 fund brokerage (VTSAX, VBTLX, VTIAX), 12%ish jumbo CD, and the rest in cash. 

My tastes and hobbies are still the same. Still have bills to pay. Still appreciate the same things: peace of mind, friends and family, cooking and eating, and enjoying new people, places, and experiences.

I don‚Äôt fully subscribe to some of the FI beliefs I see in the sub like the remaining in a particular paying job despite the high levels of job dissatisfaction and the constant questions of how one would fill their time if not working. I am ok with my job, and have plenty of outside hobbies and interests to keep me busy. In fact, I am still planning a leave of absence soon to be able to spend more time with family and in my causes. Pandemic be darned. 

All said, I still have a ways to go in reaching my goals though.

Here are things I wish I knew earlier in this journey:

Start saving and investing as early as you can. Really, as early as you can. Compounding is no joke. When I got my first real job offer, I did not sign up for 401k deductions. I now see that as a mistake. Three years and a few more jobs and unemployment periods later, I signed up for the max deductions in my new job and have been maxing it out in my jobs since. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid of a little risk.  A month after my first 401k deduction, I saw my balance declining. I freaked out and moved my money into a safer fund (but did not reduce my contributions). The money later recovered with the market and then some. This pattern would repeat over the years. Now I know that this is normal, and that we need to be in it for the long haul.

Speaking of risk, after discovering this sub three years ago I decided to open a brokerage account and slowly dump my money in there. Lots more fluctuations than my 401k but I stayed in. Good move clearly. I now see I had nothing to fear in opening an account. 

Take care of your health. Medical bills are killer.  I spent my 20s underemployed and broke, plus drowning in 10s of thousands of dollars of medical bills. The collectors are simply vicious. It took me years just to get to 0. Taking care of your health also puts you in a position to maximize work opportunities.  For one of my temp jobs it required a special physical to make sure I could handle the job.  If I failed that due to bad health, I‚Äôd not be where I am today. 

Be open minded and adventurous. I have taken jobs in the past 10 years that have come my way completely by surprise. Like that one I mentioned about the special physical. All were amazing experiences. While some I would not do again, I appreciate the experience and memories I got from them. 

Know your limits and when to stop. I have quit a few jobs too over bad bosses, bad and toxic working conditions, and when I saw the job weighing on my health. No job is worth your life. Be prepared to walk away for yourself and family if need be.

Frugal is ok. This is me. I have always been frugal. Growing up living in the projects had a part in that. But also I don‚Äôt put a lot of stock in collecting material things. I like doing things with people, from walking around together to home cooking together. These cost much less than other things. 

Value and focus on experiences and people over money and possessions. Nuff said. 

That‚Äôs my very long story in a nutshell. I may update as needed.",201.0,financialindependence
85,FIRE calculators that do different and interesting things,,1458.0,hlohjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hlohjh/fire_calculators_that_do_different_and/,1593963096.0,"I check my spreadsheet twice a year, and a guilty pleasure for me is to take my numbers and spend a couple of hours running them through different FIRE calculators to see how I'm doing.  I am visual guy, not a numbers guy, so they really help me understand things in a way that my spreadsheet does not.

These calcs all have slightly different approaches, but here's a list of ones I like and why:

This is the one I use the most, that I compare all the others to.  I don't like how the inputs are on different pages, but I like the graphic output, which is easy to understand.

[https://firecalc.com/](https://firecalc.com/)

This one is interesting because it includes actuarial information about death rates.  So, yeah, I have a 3% chance of running out of money at age 85, but I have a 30% chance of being dead, so 3% doesn't look that bad in comparison.

[https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/)

I like this one because it allows you to set a goal for how much you want left over.  Some of the calcs will show you 100% success if you end up with 1 dollar at age 100.  This one lets you set how how much nest egg you want left over for your kids.  (Or your cats.  Let's be honest.)

[https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator](https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator)

This one shows your nest egg in terms of how many days per year of freedom it will buy you. So if you have 500,000k saved and plan on spending 75k a year, your nest egg will pay for 97 days of freedom per year in retirement. That's kinda cool.

[https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/](https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/)

This one lets you show the effects of various rates of inflation which I don't see in other calcs.  I just don't like the graphic it produces as well as the other calcs.[http://www.cfiresim.com/](http://www.cfiresim.com/)  EDIT: Updated link from limpingrobot

[https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/](https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/)

This one differentiates between standard, tax deferred and Roth accounts to help you plan your withdrawals better.

[https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html](https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html)

This one it has sliders for some of the inputs which are fiddly, and you need to specify different income streams at the bottom.  On the plus side, it has room for spouse income and is very clear and interesting graphically.

[jrjjr](https://www.reddit.com/user/jrjjr/) (Creator of nesteggly) also suggests FICalc.  It has different withdrawal strategies, and lets you export or share your results. For historical data, it shows which start years would have  succeeded or failed for your portfolio.

87,UPDATE: FIRE ‚â† Happiness. 1 year into FIRE and miserable. Spending next 30 days trying to live my 'dream' fire life,,1436.0,ezancn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ezancn/update_fire_happiness_1_year_into_fire_and/,1580914289.0,"UPDATE:¬†

Hello hello!

So I wrote this [post back in November](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dq7kev/fire_happiness_1_year_into_fire_and_miserable/).

Tl;dr of the post: I wasn‚Äôt happy with FIRE, so I set lofty goals of all the things I wanted to do/change about my life and posted to Reddit. The original post blew up way more than I expected and I got some incredible feedback (some good and some bad)

Here‚Äôs my update post to see how my experiment went and where I am today. Happy to answer more in comments too.

**Summary**

**The good**

* Started dating someone. Did some great traveling.¬†
* Discovered a great insight. Most of the items that I did e.g. Gym, writing, meditation, etc. didn‚Äôt feel good in the moment. I also didn‚Äôt feel that great afterwards. There was no ‚Äòworkout‚Äô high, I didn‚Äôt feel more relaxed after I meditated, etc. HOWEVER, the interesting part is whenever I reflected back on those days, they were almost always better. My takeaway being that even if it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòfeel‚Äô better, doing those mind/body wellness exercises do make a difference. YMMV.
* I started consulting for my friends company. This was a huge win for me since it was part time, paid well, and actually led me to work on a really fun project. She built a great business but started scaling too fast and her whole company was basically on Google Spreadsheets. I migrated her to airtable and rebuilt her processes. It was great to put my skills to work, even if it was a rather small project. BUT another fun thing came out of it was there was an opportunity! Currently, there's no ability to invoice inside of Airtable! ~~So I built~~  I ideated, wireframed, and speced' custom software so if you have airtable, you can connect with stripe to charge, itemize invoice, and track all of it to airtable. I had a blast building this (teaming up with an engineer, I'm not a coder). I'm currently working on finishing up the beta and putting it into a SaaS in the next month or two. Maybe it‚Äôll generate 0 dollars, maybe it‚Äôll generate 6 figures, who knows but it was fun to scratch my own itch.¬†
* A forbes article was written about me from the original reddit post¬†
* A lot of people reached out to tell me they were in the same situation which really made me feel connected to the world in some strange way.¬†
* A lot of people asking about partnering up (which was flattering)
* Helped a couple people with some basic advice on their startups
* Got a LOT of inbound messages about how they were in the same place which was incredibly comforting. A lot of times when you're

**Bad**

* Boredom strikes: I downloaded instagram again and started redditing again (I detoxed myself on both). I've found i've been spending a lot more time on both, especially in the mornings not getting out of bed. This is probably the biggest drag to my day. It makes me feel I‚Äôm wasting a lot of time
* I didn‚Äôt finish my goal of 30 days working out, meditation, etc. I knew it was going to be hard because I was traveling and I still didn‚Äôt prepare well enough.¬†This is a good opportunity for improvement.
* I generated a lot of ideas but I still don‚Äôt have something I want to devote 100% of my time to.¬†
* Still hard to give myself permission to not be working 24/7.¬†

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned:**

* I was thrown into the deep end with RE. Definitily FI is of course a worthy goal. I continue to remind myself how lucky I am that I'm in this position. That said, I give myself permission to allow myself to not be content during the moment. But I can't stay in that space too long. I need to reframe as grateful while allowing myself space to not always be vontent. This has helped.
* Have faith in the universe that it'll work out. This is a hard one and I think important. When I felt 'stuck' it felt like there was no way out. Reframing in faith that it'll work out, would've made it easier for me to get out of the hole in the first place. Being scared of the hole just makes the hole deeper. Sometimes that fear is 80% of the hole that you're in. It was for me.
* I've done a better job figuring out what motivates me. When I reflect on why my friends project is fun for me, I've identified the following reasons:
   * I'm helping my friend get out of spreadsheets and operate in a scalable way. Her business is now operating 2x better. In other words, **I love adding value.** Kind of obvious when you write it, but it wasn't so obvious for me.
   * I'm being mentally challenged
   * I'm solving problems that are hard and even though I don't know the solution, I know I can get there. I think that's pretty fun (although probably not sustainable in all projects)
* Empathy ‚Äî when reading my post a significant amount of people said the same thing, you should be happy, or you are clearly missing something else in your life. Honestly, if i had read my post, i would've said the same thing. I clearly pictured me saying the same exact thing with the feeling that I know exavtly what the other person needs. I realized, that thought process doesn't serve me. There were a lot of people who (understandly) jumped to conclusions and thought they knew the situation. I'm not sure how I can retain this insight of not judging too fast or being empathetic moving forward but it was a good lesson.

Overall, I think my experiment was a success in that I wrote down what I wanted and got what I needed. On the flipside, there's so much more I can do. The biggest WOW for me is that I wrote intentions down and real change happened. **Setting intention AND taking action is a meaningful way to make change.**

I'm thinking I should start another experiment to get more results.

tl-dr; did a 1 month experiment and results turned out way above my expectations. Learned a lot. Still room for imporvement. Looking forward to doing a similar experiment.¬†

Hope this was helpful/interesting! Happy to answer any other questions

Student loans. Some suggested to take no more than 1 years salary.  


Emotional reactions to money (people borrowing money, sunk cost fallacy, keeping up with the Joneses, etc.)

It was a lot of fun working and strategizing how to get to it than sitting on it, but I also would have done some things differently had I known it‚Äôs pretty anti climatic once you reach it. 

Lessons learned and advice:

-Let yourself have small luxuries along the way.  Scrimping and saving is great of course, but you also need to practice spending (believe me, I know this sounds ridiculous but I didn‚Äôt practice spending and now have analysis paralysis about buying a $1.50 shirt at Goodwill.  Really.  this is a real example from last week). 

-cherish and celebrate each milestone leading up to your ultimate FIRE number.  these are just as exciting, if not more, because you are slowly proving to yourself you are able to do this.  that thrill of the first $100k, $500k, etc. is important and will feel quaint and cozy looking back on it, so make it a memory worth remembering.  

-Never, never, NEVER put your work above your relationships.  I made this mistake.  It hurt my relationship.  I did this 4 years ago and am still repairing the damage.  If your job is causing so much stress that you can‚Äôt sleep or it‚Äôs all you think about, seriously consider how to responsibly down shift and then DO IT.  Don‚Äôt let a desire to maximize your income destroy the unquantifiable good things in your life for the sake of hitting your number sooner.  

-physical and mental health are also more important than your FIRE timeline.  I learned this the hard way and now will live the rest of my life with a small work-related injury I got by ignoring cues from my body to slow down and rest.  I regret this deeply‚Äîdon‚Äôt make the same mistake.  Prioritize your health over impressing your boss, getting that promotion. building a go-getter reputation‚Äîwhatever it is, I promise you it won‚Äôt matter as much the rest of your life as having an intact and functioning physical self / mind.",344.0,financialindependence

My job's contract is ending this year, so I decided to retire in my mid 40's on Jan 2021. I have 2.8mil net worth, of which 2.5 mill is in investments. I plan to control my AGI to be 50k per year, but my family lives off of less than 40k normally. I'll be using a Roth conversion ladder to live off my IRA and taxable investments.

I'm being offered a severance package of 100k all paid in 2021. Unfortunately, the company doesn't allow me to make any 401k contributions with the severance. I plan on putting 12k into deductible IRAs to lower my AGI, so with a family of 5 that leaves me owing 2.2k in Fed and 4.8k in State taxes. Since I don't need that whole 100k, is there any other strategy to lower that AGI that I may be missing?

Would you finance wizards have any advice on dealing with the package? Also any advice on dealing with HR on this would be appreciated.

Here's my investment values the last 10 years for those interested. I did not start tracking it well till recently:

He worked extremely hard and built his own construction business. We always had everything we needed but drove inexpensive cars and never had anything too extravagant. When my dad was about 44 he decided that he reached ""his number"" and got out of construction and sold all of his real estate 6 months before the crash in 2008. I was 14 at the time and thought it was strange that other dads weren't retired and able to spend time with their families. My parents were always at all of my sporting events and it was great always having them available. The one thing I do remember is he always struggled when people asked ""what do you do?"" I never realized how rare it was until I was a bit older.

My dad is now 60 and has quadrupled his net worth without really even trying through the stock market (mainly ETF's and a few mutual funds). His lifestyle is pretty much the same as when he had nothing but we have gotten him to lighten up and enjoy things a bit more in life. He focuses his time and effort on his health and volunteering which is fulfilling. He has zero regrets about his decision to retire early and attributes his health to lack of stress.

My wife and I are extremely fortunate and have a pretty high NW for our age and have found balance between spending money on things we value (vacations, etc) but still being smart about how we spend.

I just wanted to share because he is 15+ years into his journey and has zero regret about retiring early. Also, I thought the perspective from when I was a kid would be an interesting take on those with a family!

I‚Äôm very interested in investing, despite having only basic knowledge of how to do so. I‚Äôm a long-term investor who is trying to retire early, not make a quick profit. But after reading hundreds of posts here, it got me wondering - how the hell do normal people retire? I‚Äôm on a subreddit where everyone is knowledgeable about how to reach early retirement. Even then, it seems with most peoples plans, they‚Äôll retire around 60. If that is with extreme budgeting and great investing strategies, how the hell will some normal dude with no investment knowledge make it? 

By the looks of it, you need a good chunk of money saved to retire (depending on where you live this ‚Äúchunk‚Äù varies). So what happens when the average dude checks his savings account as 65 and sees he only has $125k saved? Will people be working until they die in this generation? It sure seems like most people won‚Äôt be able to retire if this is the kind of stuff it takes to retire. 

Either way, glad I‚Äôm starting now. I‚Äôd love to retire early, or hell, even just at 65.

Edit: one question. When you guys plan on retiring, are you going to pull money from investments or are you going to live off of dividends? What would you do if you‚Äôre living off investments and something like this happened where a recession occurred?

93,Beyond expense ratios and CAGR; why the intangibles of FIRE may matter more than the quantitative factors. My perspective based on ~8 years of early retirement.,,1378.0,kl4jm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl4jm4/beyond_expense_ratios_and_cagr_why_the/,1609079376.0,"I am submitting this post to promote discussion about what I believe to be potential dangers associated with the pursuit of FIRE and to highlight the importance of, *throughout your life*,  attending to the qualitative factors that I believe are essential to a successful retirement.  My goal is to encourage those of you on the road to FIRE to take whatever steps you deem necessary to avoid these potential pitfalls.  

 I believe that, for some, FIRE becomes some sort of amorphous goal that provides both a degree of hope, *as well as an excuse to avoid working on the aspects of life that really matter*: social connections, meaningful goals, physical and mental health. This is especially true for people who, while highly intelligent and well educated, are relatively less adept at enhancing and developing the qualitative aspects of life.

Some of you may remember me from my previous posts.  Recently I have started to  think more about what accounts for post FIRE happiness, meaning, fulfillment and health.   I believe that, just as it is important to devote X percent of your salary to an IRA throughout your life, it is equally important to devote X percent of your time to physical and mental health, maintaining or rekindling old friendships and cultivating new ones.  Failure to do so puts one at risk for an unfulfilling and unhealthy retirement.  

It's as if some FIRE aspirants are saying to themselves: ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm in poor physical health, depressed and socially isolated and I hate my job.  But that‚Äôs ok, because, one day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù.  But then that day comes; you are FI, but with nothing with which to fill the void.  I have seen this before.  Retirement is often accompanied by a huge let down.  Some become depressed and drink.  Some stay at home all day, every day leading to friction with their SO.  Some blow vast amounts of money on baubles in *a vain attempt to find some sort of justification for the decades they had sacrificed to get to this point.*

I am eternally thankful to my parents who were wise enough to facilitate and support my nascent hobbies and passions.  Because of them I had endless things to motivate me when I stopped working.  I am equally aware that my natural tendency to reach out to old friends, work colleagues etc. meant that I had a deep and wide pool of social support when I need it.  Nevertheless, I have struggled with periods of loneliness since I stopped working ~8 years ago, long before I had ever heard of FIRE.  My new girlfriend has both added tremendously to my life and strengthened my understanding of the vital importance of close interpersonal relationships.   

There are lots of young, highly educated people who are generally dissatisfied with the ‚Äòrewards‚Äô of their sacrifices.  They are exhausted by meaningless work, narcissistic supervisors, back stabbing colleagues and no identifiable path to a better work life.  They are left to ask‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy the f**k did I sacrifice so much?  For this?‚Äù      

I suspect that, to varying degrees, most of the people who are aspiring to FIRE are life long hard workers who have, throughout life, been rewarded for delaying gratification and have received accolades for their performance.

Unfortunately, this focus on career progress can lead to a self-reinforcing dynamic if you devote so much of your time and resources to work that you never develop hobbies, you become socially isolated and your physical/mental health declines. 

I imagine that for more than one reader of this subreddit, your first three decades go something like this:  You buckled down in school and got yourself into a solid university.  You moved to one city for undergrad, then a different city for your first job‚Ä¶by the time you are 30 you are likely to be living in a city to which you have few ties, far from home, old friends and family and with little in your life other than work.  Eventually, you become dissatisfied with this life.  If only‚Ä¶..FIRE!  You begin to fantasize about the day when things will be *‚Äòdifferent‚Äô*, and you work ever harder so as to hasten the arrival of FI/RE.  This can lead to a dangerous and self reinforcing cycle in which the unrelenting pursuit of FIRE comes with further neglect of the qualitative factors that are playing a significant role in life dissatisfaction.  

FIRE is not a panacea that will address all of the root causes of your dissatisfaction.  That is a much more complex process. Meaning in life, like financial independence, can be compared to tending an orchard.  In both cases is imperative that you nurture your seedlings/trees regularly, over the course of decades and long before you plan to eat the fruit.  If you wait until you are hungry, you are in trouble. I know that this is easier said than done, but just as it is important to begin saving and investing early and well before your planned FIRE date, it is equally important to maintain health, social connections and meaningful, non career activities while you are working towards FI.


**TL;DR** 
The quantitative aspects of FIRE are arguably less important to a successful retirement than the various, and often neglected, qualitative factors. I believe that many FIRE aspirants are so motivated to attain financial independence that they don‚Äôt consider the potential negative consequences of pursuing the quantitative aspects of FIRE (e.g., savings rate, CAGR, etc.) *at the expense* of what are potentially more important qualitative factors (i.e. relationships, health, etc).",228.0,financialindependence

I lived in a third world country in south america. Classic middle class upbringing, didn't face any financial issues, but country is unsafe, getting robbed at gunpoint is a real possibility, city infrastructure falling apart, corrupt governments, etc. 

I'm splitting this in topics so you can skip to the end if you don't care about the background details = )

**Bachelors in home country:**

I would have loved to do my bachelors abroad, specially in the US, but it wasn't possible.

In my country, public universities are very competitive to get in, because they have no tuition, while the private ones do. I wouldn't call it ""free"" because the amount of taxes we pay in my country, for pretty much nothing in return, zero tuition in college is about the only thing we ever get back. Universities have way less resources in my country, but the schooling itself is good. I did well in the entrance exam, got into one of the top schools in latam and studied electrical engineering, which meant no school debt, which was fortunate.

**Experiences abroad**

During my studies, I spent a year studying abroad in Europe on a scholarship, which gave me a taste of what living in a 1st word country was like.

I also did a work-abroad program, working in the US for about 3 months during our school break. I got paid minimum wage, which was 7.25/hr at the time, working an unskilled job that was customer facing. I lived with roommates and kept expenses low, but what I could afford on that minimum wage in the US was so much more than what many skilled jobs would afford in my country. It was a very comfortable life for me in comparison, even though my american coworkers often complained about the pay. This helps put into perspective that it really depends on what a person's baseline is for comfort.

Both of those experiences abroad were also very competitive in school, and took a lot of preparing and keeping good grades to achieve.

**First job in home country**

I graduated 5 years later (engineering takes 5 yrs there) in a recession, where junior engineer jobs were impossible to find, while our alumni from only a couple years prior had much better luck in finding a first job and getting offers from their internships.

New-grad 'accelerated career' programs had become popular, were paying above market rate (which was crap at this point due to the economy), and were very hard to get in. It took preparing and going through long interview processes with many, until I finally got one. Mine had over 10,000 applicants for under 20 job openings. I hoped to join an American company because everyone I had ever met who immigrated to the US in the last few years, had done so by being transferred by their company.

So I joined this US company, stayed for almost 4 years, got promoted twice, and realized that getting transferred was never going to happen, despite the fact that I kept being told it could be a possibility. The last person to get transferred in that company had done so the year before I joined... and they apparently got very restrictive with it afterwards due to US visas getting harder to obtain (is what I heard, but who knows).

This made me feel very unlucky tbh, like if I had just joined a couple years earlier I could have had a chance.

**Masters in home country**

Anyways,  I became interested in Machine Learning and started doing a masters of science in the same university, part time, while working my full time job. This had no tuition cost, as I was doing research work, and I would've been eligible for a stipend for this work without the full time job. This was kind of a bummer, but my job salary was much higher and wasn't worth giving up for the stipend.

This masters took about 3 years. My schedule was insane. I was saving money aggressively, so I lived in a tiny studio reasonably close to school (cheap rent, mostly college students) and didn't have a car.

Nearly all my former classmates and all my coworkers had cars at this point, because public transportation sucks in my country. I took a bus from home to work and walked (over 30min each way) from home to school.

Because my classes (and later on, research meetings), were mostly at night, this often meant my class ended at 11pm, and I still had to walk home, eat dinner, then be up at around 6am the next day to be able to catch the bus and get to work by 8am. All my actual research work had to be done in the evenings (the nights I didn't have classes) and weekends, as well as any homework or studying for the exams.

This schedule was brutal but it allowed me to save a lot of money. I did make a few spending compromises: I nearly always bought premade food for dinner, usually from the grocery store. In my country, the extra cost between raw food and ready to eat is not as large as in the US, but either way, I did not have the energy to cook for myself with this schedule.

I  had a budget for 'fun money' so I could still do some things I wanted, but I was very aggressive in saving.

**Career change to ML:**

When my masters was almost finished, I started applying for ML jobs. They are (or were, at the time) extremely rare in my country.

I realized I had to widen my search, and applied for a job in a bigger city, with much higher cost of living. I got the job and moved there, trading my decent studio for a super crappy suite in a shared building. Despite the housing downgrade, I was actually paying more in rent than before.

The transportation situation got much worse as well without a car, I had to take a bus and then the subway, then walk in a sketchy part of town to get to the office. 

This was an European company with a US presence, but it was clear that getting transferred was very unlikely as well. But the salary was much higher, and getting the work experience in ML was also worth it.

**Studying in the US:**

At this point I decided to move to the US for a masters. I considered multiple options (fully funded Phd would take 5+yrs of living with a low wage; another research masters, perhaps partially funded) and settled on applying for 1-yr professional masters. These programs cost more in tuition, but after doing some math, I realized the extra living costs of staying in school longer, plus the opportunity cost of being away from the industry would offset that in my case.

I checked what my savings would let me afford, when converted to USD, and realized this would wipe out most of my savings, but I could swing it for programs with reasonable tuition (some were almost 6 figures, I didn't bother applying to those).

I applied to a few, and got a partial merit scholarship in one of my preferred locations. The scholarship was conditional on keeping a high GPA.

So at this point, I mapped my worst and best case scenarios. Worst case scenario would be I can't keep my GPA high enough and lose the scholarship and end up having to pay full price on the tuition, then don't land a job in the US and have to move back to my country. I noted in this scenario, most of my savings would have been wiped and I would be back where I started but with nearly 0 NW, and a US diploma (which would not make my salary any higher in my home country since I already had a local masters). Btw, flunking the program was not a worst case scenario I considered as I had always been a good student and had faith in my ability to complete it without any issues.

The best case scenario would be I keep the scholarship, pay reduced tuition, land a high paying job in a HCOL city and save most of my income, and ""pay off"" myself for all the tuition+living costs of the masters in about 1.5 years on my projections, then stay for another 1.5 years (maximum duration of a student visa post graduation is 3 years for STEM majors). It would still be unknown how long I would be able to remain in the US afterwards, as that depends on a bunch of visa variables that wouldn't depend just on me, such as getting selected in the H-1B work visa lottery). But at this point, the extra 1.5yrs of savings in dollars would make the whole thing a clear financial win, when compared to wages in my country.

When I put in my notice at my job, they offered me a raise and a promotion, and it was hard to turn it down, but I knew it had to be done, so I left.

During my masters, I lived in a make-shift ""room"" in a living room, so I saved a lot of rent, at the cost of my sanity, because my roommates really didn't make it easy.

Someone cooking in the middle of the night (literally, like 2am) with the lights on (and kitchen/living room were combined..) was at least a weekly occurrence, dirty dishes in the sink all the time, having multiple visitors in the super tiny 2-bedroom frequently, sometimes sleeping in the kitchen (seriously, wtf). Anyways, I can't say I regret it because I truly saved a lot of money, but there were many times I felt ""I'm too old for this s\*\*\*\*"".

I did one internship during the program, at one of my favorite startups, which was a great experience, and allowed me to have a little bit of income, plus they had free lunch and dinner, so the days I were there were the days I ate best during that year. I quickly learned that eating take out everyday was not going to fly in this city like it did in my home country, because prices were insane. So I learned to cook cheap stuff with quick recipes, lots of quick baked potatoes in the toaster oven and rice in the rice cooker, fried eggs, and a fair share of ramen in the nights prior to exams, etc.

**Full time job in the US:**

I applied to over a hundred job postings, and I as admittedly very picky at first, which some of my professors disagreed with. I wanted to give myself a couple months

where I only tried for jobs I truly wanted, and gave myself a deadline, where I would start applying to ""anything within reason"" if I didn't get it by then.

I couldn't take too long to get a job, otherwise I would not be eligible for a visa extension. The jobs I wanted were very technical, and usually required things like leetcoding and solving ML things live on a whiteboard or over the phone, so I practiced for those quite a bit. I felt I should have practiced even more, but after all those years of full time job + masters, plus the 1yr intensive program in a new country, I was getting very tired at this point, and was mindful not to burn myself out.

After too many applications with no responses, I landed 3 offers. One of them was a big N company, which was precisely what I wanted, so that's the one I took. At this point some friends and I started going to movies / restaurants / short weekend trips more frequently. Those expenses went up but not by too much. I also stopped eating ramen and frozen food so frequently, and started buying better, but still cheap stuff.

I finally moved out to my own tiny studio in an old building in a cheap part of town early this year, and despite the rent hike, I don't regret it at all, and is the best ""splurge"" I could make. I spent over a decade living like a broke college student, and I feel like I can finally get some of the things I want now. Such as I had wanted a 4k TV since forever, and I finally bought one this year (still wanted for it to go on sale, and got one for 500, so nothing nuts)

**Now:**

I've been with my company for about a year now, and I got promoted last month. So things are good. I reached my goal of saving up the same amount I spent during my masters in less than a year, in part due to the signing bonus, which I did not account for, and my initial salary was also higher than what I had projected. So I'm actually doing a bit better than my ""best case scenario"" I mapped out before coming to the US. These last few years have not been easy for immigrants, and I don't want to get political, just saying the uncertainty and stress surrounding added visa restrictions have been significant, so I am very grateful that things have worked out for me so far.

So yeah, this has been my path so far. I was very fortunate in many aspects (growing up middle class, no family/health issues, no disabilities), but also, compared to others, there were times when I felt others had it so much easier (being born in a 1st world country; getting a visa through family; immigrating years ago when the process was easier; having a rich uncle who sends you to undergrad abroad; getting employed/transferred because you know people in high places; graduating when engineer jobs were peaking, etc).

I figured all I could do was work with the situation I was in, there's always someone who has it better or worse, and through hard work, I took a few leaps of faith, and it all ended up working out. I know many people in similar jobs to mine were able to reach this same milestone in their early 20s, but also many aren't even nearly there yet despite years of 6 figure salaries, due to higher spending. so it's all relative.

To me FI is much more of a goal then RE, because I like my field of work, but I want RE to be a possibility, because I may feel differently in 10 or 20 years.

I have met many people who had a similar immigration path to mine (although from latam to the US is relatively rare, most I've met are through family immigration), but got the feeling it wasn't very common in this sub, so wanted to share. And if anyone is a fellow immigrant, I hope you found this encouraging.",123.0,financialindependence

My spouse and I hit our FI # last year. He's in tech and I own a hair salon. We also have one rental property. (Our plan is to eventually have one more.) Being financially independent was always our goal. We're in our 30s, so retiring seemed ridiculous. Our normal workdays can be 10-14 hours long, and for two workaholics, we wondered what we'd actually do with ourselves without work to fill the void.

Enter coronavirus. My salon has been shut down for almost two months, and our CA stay-at-home order was just extended for another month. My husband is working from home, but with limited hours. I'm finally getting a taste of what retired life looks like, and not going to lie, it's surprisingly awesome.

We have a relaxed breakfast together every morning. I've been slowly working on turning our small yard into a permaculture food forest, and it's amazing how much progress can be made without work in the way. I've been volunteering for a covid-assist group, delivering groceries to people who can't leave their homes, which gets me out on my bike every day. I cook all of our meals, a lot of which comes from our own gardens, so we're eating much healthier. I still make videos and posts for the salon's social media, all creative looks that I feel inspired to do--not pressured to do, which is how I felt when I was working full time.

We're both calmer and happier these days. Our house is actually clean. (Something we never had time to do.) And we fight so much less. I told him that I'm dreading going back to how things were, and he agreed: our life before quarantine wasn't sustainable. We were heading for burnout. We're now looking into purchasing our second rental property, and then finally taking the plunge into RE. 

Without the shutdown, we probably would have been too scared to ever leave our jobs. This was definitely the nudge we needed.",192.0,financialindependence
96,FIRE update 1 year in - Lean(ish) FIRE accidentally turned into Coast FIRE? A case study to consider for those who are on the fence about pulling the trigger.,,1347.0,ig9nmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ig9nmu/fire_update_1_year_in_leanish_fire_accidentally/,1598351940.0,"My wife and I FIREd last year with about $1M invested, and 1-1.5 years of cash on hand.

The original plan was to completely stop working, and follow the standard 4% rule to live off approximately $40k/year. We thought we could do this because we had spent the past 8 years diligently saving, being frugal, and finding ways to maximize investment value.

What actually happened was the following:

* My wife's solo business kept generating some income without a lot of time investment (a lot of that was momentum, so we expect it to slow down at some point without some more effort)
* I got antsy to find some freelance software development work after about 6 months. I was so burned out when I left my job, I could not imagine this happening, but it turned out I really just needed a 6 month sabbatical. Now I have one project that takes up about 15 hours a week, which suits me perfectly.

The result of these two things was that we recently had a moment of clarity. For our situation, we can work maybe 25% as hard as we used to, and generate more than enough income to cover our annual expenses. We can also do this while pursuing our pre-FIRE goals, which mostly involved slow travel (yeah, maybe next year...) and raising our daughter without having to send her to daycare.

Of course, this is really just Coast FIRE that we stumbled into. The difference being that we are now ""coasting"" with the amount invested that we planned on living off indefinitely. If we can keep this up for the next 15-20 years, we will be comfortably sitting on a portfolio of $2.5M to $4M, which should be more than enough to ""actually retire"" in our late 40s/early 50s.

The other nice side effect of this strategy is that if we make significantly more than we need to live on in a given year (which is happening this year), we can choose to loosen our belts a bit and splurge on large expenses or add to our investments.

Anyway, I know this is a specific situation that does not apply to everyone, but I urge anyone who is close to pulling the trigger on FIRE to consider if this could work for you. For us, it really is the best of all worlds, in terms of happiness, security, and freedom.",297.0,financialindependence

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4xnazq/sanity_check_for_burned_out_35yr_old_looking_to_re/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Since that post, I worked another year or so, and got a windfall from crypto which put my net worth at close to $2M. I bought a $400k condo in a ski town and quit my job in May 2018 at age 36.

I've been feeling nauseous and losing sleep over the recent market drop. I took a look at my budget and think I am still ok, but if the market loses another 30-50%, I'm not sure what I'll do. Having been doing nothing but play video games and snowboarding the last two years, I doubt I could get another engineering job, even at a much lower salary. Before I retired, I said as long as there isn't another great depression, I'd be fine...

Anyway, here are my numbers.

Paid off condo - $400k, not included in WR calculations. A lot of people said it was smarter to get a mortgage at a low rate so I could keep more money invested, but I'm glad I went with buying my home outright. I know I just have to cover taxes and HOA and I'll have a place to live.

Various investments - $1.35M. This was 1.85 just a few weeks ago. Fairly well diversified, but still stock heavy. Had about $100k left in crypto which got cut in half the last few weeks. So much for BTC being digital gold lol.

Actual total spending in 2019 - $43,283. 

Income from renting out my condo on AirBNB and living with parents for \~5 weeks during peak ski and holiday season - $9k 

Using the $1.85M figure which I finished at last year, my WR was 1.8% for 2019. Using my current portfolio of 1.35M, WR jumps up to 2.5%.

I think I can cut back to \~$35k spending this year by eliminating restaurants, travel, and some hobby related spending, which would put my WR at 2.0%, assuming I can rent my place again next winter for \~$9k again. That is a big assumption given the trajectory of the economy. I still have a little breathing room before I hit a 3.5% WR. At that point I'd have to start looking for any kind of work.

Anyway, my advice is don't do leanFIRE. If I didn't have some cushion and low WR numbers, I'd be in a full blown panic. Give yourself a lot of room in case the unthinkable happens, e.g. a pandemic.",272.0,financialindependence

Location: Dumaguete, Philippines- 1.5 hour plane ride from Manila

I've been on strict home quarantine for over 5 weeks. The President's lockdown on the country's capital (home of 12 million people) is more restrictive than any place I know not named Wuhan.

On the plus side, I'm blessed to be staying in a beautiful house. I do yoga on a manicured lawn in a well-tended garden. A fantastic cook and a delightful maid make sure my girlfriend and I are taken care of. Nearly every day has been sunshine and blue skies.

On the downside, the ""enhanced community quarantine"" (what the government has dubbed this lockdown), allows only one person in the house to leave for any reason. I am not that person. **I literally am not allowed to leave my home for over 45 days (with new rumors to 75 days).** Still, I feel like riding it out on an island in the Philippines was the safest choice.

""Shelter in Place"" may be the right decision for me, but not everyone feels the same way. Since late January, the **US government has had to rescue 62,000+ US citizens stranded abroad due to the pandemic.** Tickets for these repatriation flights can run several thousand dollars, of which the US government pays zero. Given the cost and health risk of flying and returning to the US, I was curious what led some people to retreat for home vs. staying ""sheltered in place"" overseas.

Many of us talk about FIRE abroad. Some of us already are. Hopefully, this pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime event. But what if it isn't? When things get rough, and stress is high, when backup plans blow up in your face, do you stay abroad or pack up and head home? What criteria do you use to make a decision? How safe is safe?

## The Frugal Vagabond

u/iamlindoro‚Äã

**STAYED: Granada, Spain**

>""Though we had plenty of warning that our window to travel internationally was closing, we opted to stay here for a number of reasons.""

## How long have you been living overseas, and where were you living before travel restrictions went down?

We've lived in Spain for just over two years. Spain is one of the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic and is subject to some of the most stringent restrictions on everyday movement in the world. Though we had plenty of warning that our window to travel internationally was closing, we opted to stay here for a number of reasons.

## Why did you decide to stay?

We saw that Spain was seeing large numbers of infections and deaths despite excellent universal healthcare and an almost universal acceptance of the restrictive quarantine. We compared those conditions with the casual (or even arrogant) attitudes we saw about the need to limit contact in the US, and anticipated that the US would soon carry a much higher risk of infection with coronavirus.

## If the pandemic extends for another 30-60 days, would you make the same decision?

Ultimately we are more confident that Spain will take the necessary steps to contain and hopefully eliminate cases going forward. We do expect the crisis to continue at least another 30-60 days and with that in mind, are comfortable with our decision. Shelves are well stocked at the grocery stores, and the only things we've missed out on here and there are creature comforts like a particular brand of candy or imported items.

## Was there any aggressive hording in Spain, similar to the toilet paper stories we are hearing out of the US?

There was exactly one day where we saw empty toilet paper shelves here in Granada: the day after they canceled school for the rest of the year in our province, which was also the day before the quarantine was declared. That day, there was also no meat in the store. Since that day, we haven't seen any obvious hoarding. There's always been enough of all of the necessities, but they're definitely being prioritized by supermarkets over some of the less popular creature comforts.

## You mention Spain's health coverage. Did the US health care system play a part into your decision making?

US health insurance played a small role in our decision, mostly because we have a Spanish policy that covers everywhere in the world... except for the USA. That's pretty telling, but logistically we tend to buy short term emergency policies when we visit the US, and I would be very anxious with such a minimal plan in the midst of a pandemic.

## Our Freedom Years

Stephanie & Gillian

**LEFT: Italy for Toronto, Canada**

>""We were safe and comfortable there for a month - despite being in the epicentre of the Italian outbreak - but knew we had to leave...""

## How long have you been living overseas, and where are you currently living?

We‚Äôve been traveling full-time for the past six months. We were previously working as expats in Singapore but we were able to reach our financial goals, say goodbye to corporate jobs and set off for a life of travel. Our plan is to take the next few years to explore the world slowly, starting with Europe.

However, much to our surprise, we've found ourselves to be back home in Canada after a seven year absence. We had intended to be in Croatia by this time of year but our plans were cut short by the virus outbreak.

## Did you decide to stay overseas or return home?

When the COVID 19 outbreak became a global concern in March, we were in the midst of a two-month trip in Italy. We tried to leave Italy but our last-minute flight to Hungary was cancelled. We quickly decided to find sanctuary at a friend's holiday home at Lake Como in northern Italy.

We were safe and comfortable there for a month - despite being in the epicentre of the Italian outbreak - but knew we had to leave, not least because our Schengen visas were about to expire.

We then went to the only country where we were guaranteed to be welcomed, which is our home country of Canada.

## If the pandemic extends for another 30-60 days, would you make the same decision?

As long as the travel bans are in place, we will stay in Canada. Being here allows us to provide support to family during a difficult time. We are taking this situation as an opportunity to spend time with loved ones after having lived overseas for so many years.

## What city or country would be your primary choice to live during a COVID-19 lockdown, and why?

As value seekers, we would ideally prefer to be situated in a less expensive city than Toronto, although this is where our family lives. We would likely choose another large, interesting city in Canada, such as Montreal.

Of course, our main interest is getting back on the road again and picking up our travel itinerary in the Balkans. Here's hoping travel is safe again soon!

I was vesting grants of roughly $40K a year, with a stock price 30% below all time highs.   I was in the Operations area ... plant management, supply chain, project management stuff.    Just under 20 years at the company.

I managed my own job reduction so that i received the package.   The package was 40 weeks of pay and vacation.   I also picked up unemployment for 20 weeks ...that was only worth $8K.

The leave plan was executed perfectly ... it took about 9 months of planning and conversations with some decent timing as a backdrop.    Big companies are always looking for cost reduction projects and i was able to add myself on to a larger project.   Being somewhere for 20 years and knowing most everyone made this somewhat easy but i also was in a role that could eliminated without a major reorganization of responsibilities.

I had about $1.2 MM liquid, $1.4 MM 401K / IRA, and $800K in deferred income ... payable over 10 years (roughly $80K a year).   All in all $3.4MM.   Wife has health insurance for the family and makes about $20K in a part time role.   We both get pensions at age 65 ... about $60K per year, neither is COLA.   3 kids ... oldest kids were just getting into college.  80% of the total college anticipated costs were accounted for.   With good returns i would not have to add to the 3rd kids college.   Basically needed $300K and had $220K.   As I type this, I'm still about $50k short but i have 3 years before i need the first installment for the 3rd child.

I spend about $125K per year.

Lessons learned in no particular order.

Don't count on your friends having time during the work week.   I thought i would be able to grab a few more beers mid week with one of my buddies during the work week.   That never really worked ... guys who are working all week and have kids never have much time during the week.

More exercise time ... yea, it's true but I worked out a lot before i left the job.  Outside of never missing a workout ... i didn't workout more or get healthier because i didn't work.

Less stress ... yea, it is less stressful but you find other ways to get stressed.   However, this was a win, no question.

Positive surprises -  I have spent more time with the kids.  That's all good.  Also, feel like i enjoyed more days of the week.   Enjoy my friends a little more.

A little stressful though as i'm dealing unwinding a few contractors from the business.   Legal stuff and then watching the customers to see if they stay with us.  Not sure how long i'll stay in the business.   At least another year.   I like it but not much $ considering the work right now.   I can probably sell my share for another $10K or so.

EDITS:  We sacrificed big time during our 20s through our mid 30s.   Drove older used cars (will never buy a new car, btw), didn't spend much $, saved as much as possible.   We never took expensive vacations and did everything on deal.   I spent so much time thinking about the day i could retire early.   I read a lot and pushed hard to get there.   Once we had the $ pretty much saved and i had a good income, we started spending more.   We went from spending $60K to $100K a year in just a couple years ... kids are expensive too as they get into all kinds of sports and interests.

Thank you for reading!***


**Background**

I grew up middle class in a developing country (Middle East) as an only child. I was privileged to have parents who were more than willing to forego most pleasures in life‚Äîincluding travel, nicer cars, etc.‚Äîand to instead spend every penny they had to make sure I received the best education possible. They put me in a private American school and paid for my college education, but they also were not the absolute savviest with money.

My health and education came first for my parents, but what came a very close second was every little whim and desire I had as a child‚Äîthey spoiled me. They almost never invested, and instead spent all their extra money on whatever clothes, computers, videogames, music CDs, cameras or extra pocket money I wanted as a teenager. They found it very hard to say no to me. Because of this I grew up not knowing or appreciating the value of money, and by the time they (involuntarily) retired in their 50s they had virtually no savings.

What‚Äôs done is done, right? By the time I woke up to all this in 2013, I was 26 years old and armed with a pretty good education, but I hadn‚Äôt exactly been all that successful since graduating in 2008. I had gotten my CPA back in 2009 and was working at a public accounting firm making a measly $12,000/year (yes, that low, because developing country).

I hated my job, mainly because of the people I worked with, but I won‚Äôt get into that in any great detail. There was just a big gap between the way I had learned to work in a private/American education and the way I had to work ‚Äòout in the real world‚Äô. I also had not been promoted in several years because I was seen by my peers and supervisors as a poor team player.

**Anyway, in early 2014, everything changed!** Thanks to the way my education and career start looked on paper‚Äîand thanks to LinkedIn Premium which I was (and still am) paying $30/month for‚ÄîI was headhunted for a financial controller position in an east African country. This of course meant leaving my family, my city and my friends, and starting all over. To me this was all very new and scary, but it was almost a complete no-brainer. The move was to propel me from $12,000/year to $75,000/year + all the benefits that come with an expat position.

One thing that made it even easier for me to work abroad was my U.S. citizenship, which I got from my father‚Äôs side of my family. Anyway, I packed everything that mattered to me in a few suitcases and got on a one-way flight. My liquid net worth was negative at the time; I had $25,000 worth of credit card debt, plus more owed to my parents. I paid it all off within a few months of moving, but my parents later refused to let me pay them back what they‚Äôd contributed for an apartment back in my hometown. The apartment cost about $115,0000 and they‚Äôd paid for half of it. I still own it.

Since I made that move in 2014, I have made two more moves to other countries, and I‚Äôve grown to quite enjoy my job and responsibilities. I‚Äôve been promoted three times, and each promotion or move has come with a salary bump. I am now a CFO and my income has steadily climbed from the $75,000 in 2014 to $110,000 now in 2020. In addition to that, I get a ~30% performance-based bonus, and a 6% retirement benefit, plus company-paid housing, furniture, utilities, car, gas, internet, phone, house help, gardener, and two flight tickets home per year.

I‚Äôm fairly happy with how I‚Äôve done over the past 6 years, but I look back and I still think to myself: What if I hadn‚Äôt been so spoiled? What if I‚Äôd learned the value of money earlier in life? What if I‚Äôd saved my money and started investing at the age of 21 instead of 27? Where would I be now?


**Current financial position**

I have an insane Excel spread sheet I‚Äôve been developing and using for the last 6 years. I track every dollar I make or spend, every stock I buy, and hundreds of metrics. I do it religiously, and it‚Äôs made it very easy to pull numbers out to share with you guys.

In [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/tUgIRIN), my total net worth over time is in orange, and my liquid net worth is in black. The green line is my stock portfolio.

[This table](https://imgur.com/ny564mj) breaks down my current net worth near the end of 2020 and each of the previous 6 years. I‚Äôve kept things pretty simple and my stocks are split between two individual accounts with two brokerages‚Äîthere‚Äôs no 401k or IRA of any kind. As a U.S. citizen with no home base in the U.S., I get to exclude much of my income under the FEIE rule, but it also means I can‚Äôt contribute anything to a tax-advantaged account.

***EDIT: Several of you have pointed out an error I've made in the original chart and table. I erroneously included in my illiquid net worth (from 2014 to 2016) a separate property that my parents owned until 2016. I was tracking the value of that property in my spreadsheet before it was sold in 2016, but it was never a part of my own net worth and it shouldn't have made its way into the table and chart.***

***I've updated the [table](https://imgur.com/a/Dr2n09G) and [chart](https://imgur.com/a/KTdZoDH). Thanks for pointing out this error!***

These are currently my 6 largest stock positions:

|**Stock**|**% Gain**|**Value**|
:--|--:|--:|
|**TSLA**|+411%|$ 100,400|
|**NFLX**|+43%|$ 79,800|
|**AAPL**|+51%|$ 77,000|
|**FB**|+281%|$ 61,200|
|**AMZN**|+104%|$ 48,100|
|**MSFT**|+62%|$ 39,300|
 
[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/RYsIKmP) shows my income and how much of it I have spent/saved since 2014. I had a particularly low savings rate in 2016 and 2017 because in those years I pursued (and paid mostly out of pocket for) an expensive top 20 MBA degree. I find out more and more every day that this degree is (and will probably continue to be) completely useless to me, and that the ~$85,000 I spent on it would have been much better invested in the market. My CPA is what I need for my job, and my company never cared whether I got an MBA degree.

You can also see evidence of a fair amount of lifestyle creep between 2018 and 2020 in the chart below. In some years I travelled more than others, but generally my living expenses now hover around the $25,000/year mark.

I‚Äôve also been very fortunate to have invested during the recent insane bull run, and [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/gNgO1wn) shows just how much it has helped my net worth over the last couple of years.

You can see in the chart that as of now near the end of 2020, I have invested a total of $300,000 into the stock market, and my portfolio‚Äôs estimated value at 12/31/2020 is $680,600. This makes for a total return of 121%, and I‚Äôve calculated an annualized return of over 50% based on the timings of each of my deposits into the brokerage account.


**The way forward**

I feel that I‚Äôve had a great deal of success over the past years, and I attribute most of it to a great ability to save thanks to the way my compensation has been structured and the FEIE. I do, however, recognize that the current market conditions which have allowed my net worth to climb as rapidly as I show in the table below will not necessarily last.

|Year|Net Worth||
:--|--:|:--|
|2014| 248,300||

|2020| 1,071,000|+58%|
**Large decrease in NW due to severe drop in Dollar value of property valued in a foreign currency which suffered severe valuation in that year.*

I‚Äôve calculated my FI number at $2,500,000, which I believe would allow me to live comfortably and be able to spend up to $80,000/year in today‚Äôs dollars, adjusted for inflation. Based on my current and expected future salary, as well as my expected future savings rate. I‚Äôve also calculated that I can likely achieve my FI number at age 41. Some of my assumptions include a 49-year retirement, average inflation of 2.6%, an annual contribution to my investments of $110,000 (adjusted for inflation), pre-retirement market return of 7%, post-retirement market return of 6%, fixed income return of 5.5%, percent in equities is 110-age (so it changes every year), and annual expenses of $80,000, which decline by 2%/year after age 65.

I guess one other thing I'm grateful for is that I'm not stuck in a loop trying (and failing) to get rich quick like I see some of my friends doing. I'm glad I'm taking the slow and steady path, and that I have the patience and discipline for it.

I‚Äôm very happy to get into discussions and answer questions. There are many more charts, calculations and concepts I‚Äôd love to discuss and share. The only things I do not want to be asked are 1) what countries I‚Äôve lived/worked in, and 2) what companies I‚Äôve worked for. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to read my story, and I‚Äôd love to hear your comments!

104,How an extravagant car set me on the path to financial independence,,1276.0,j4ptih,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j4ptih/how_an_extravagant_car_set_me_on_the_path_to/,1601771054.0,"I should start by saying that I am not financially independent.  I'm happily on my way, but not there yet.  I thought this post might be an interesting insight into how something generally considered to be amongst the worst uses of money... a *new* (gasp!) *luxury* (cringe!) *vehicle* (faint!) actually wound up being a good thing for me.

So how on earth did something so universally vilified within FIRE circles actually work out in my favor?

First, a little background.  I grew up in a ""wealthy"" middle class family but had relatively little financial education.  My parents made sure to educate us on the perils of things like credit card debt (""if you pay it off in full each month, it's a free loan.  If you don't, it's tremendously expensive""), but beyond that, there wasn't much (no investing/budgeting/tracking spending).  If we're being totally honest, I would classify my family as ""big income, big spenders"" as typified in The Millionaire Next Door.  (I am by no means trying to disparage my parents or my otherwise exceptionally privileged upbringing, just making an observation about how money was treated growing up.)

I attended the US Air Force Academy for college, which was an excellent financial decision as luck would have it.  I got a world-class education for no money (though you do pay in other ways).  I had a stable, guaranteed income for the next 10 years of my life (after pilot training).  No debt.  Various tax-free allowances.  Free socialized healthcare.  And a less-known perk of the military called a ""career starter loan""--a 5 year loan of \~$30k at a low interest rate (usually \~1%).  I invested some of mine (haphazardly at the advice of some USAA financial advisors), used some for a down payment on a new car (no, not the car referenced in the title...just wait), and loaned some to my siblings to help them through college.  This is all relevant because...

Once I graduated, had my incredibly stable income via the military, and monthly payments to make on both my car and paying off the loan, I realized that I *hated* having monthly payments.  I paid both off ahead of schedule.  Even though the loan \*on paper\* is something I should not have paid off ahead of time (it's pretty easy to beat 1% interest in the stock market)...but I just hated knowing that bill was due.

Fast forward another year and I find myself developing a mild interest in ""affordable"" sports cars (mustangs and the like).  I'm a pilot, so I like to think I have an appreciation for high-performance things, even if I'm not particularly a ""gear head.""  So 25 year old me is researching these cars, and there's one catch.  Fuel. Efficiency.  I'm very much an environmentalist and the prospect of getting a coupe or sedan with less than 30 miles/gallon fuel economy was just unacceptable, regardless of how nice the car is.

Enter [this comic by The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s).  That was it.  Game over.  Checkmate.  You're telling me I can have the acceleration of a sports car, the practicality of a 4 door family sedan, the safety of a tank, all with a pittance of the pollution produced by a gas guzzler?  Count me in.  There was just one little catch...those things are expensive.  Real expensive.  And remember the part about me hating to have monthly payments for things?  I was not about to have a monthly car payment equivalent to a mortgage.

So there was only one thing to do:  start saving.  My Tesla goal, in conjunction with a hatred of debt, got me to start saving quite early in my career.  I started with $500/month...enough to buy a Model S in cash after *just* 10 years.  But 10 years is a long time, and I found that I really didn't notice my extra savings impacting my lifestyle.  So $500/month became $500/paycheck, which became $750/paycheck and continued to grow from there.  I intended to pay cash for that thing when I finally had enough.  So, **the first thing that car did was get me to start saving early in my career and at a much higher rate than I would have otherwise, because I had a goal.**  Not the most financially savvy goal, but I was saving quite a bit anyway.

Next, somewhat fortunately, I had a general intuition that my .01% interest savings account wasn't a great place to keep my money, and I had gleaned some basic knowledge of the stock market through coworkers.  I knew that with a long enough time horizon market risk was lower, and that there was at least an opportunity to make some extra cash.  I also figured that even if I did poorly, it would just mean a little be more time driving my perfectly serviceable Hyundai Elantra (great car, btw).  So I started throwing my monthly savings into an individual brokerage account.  I didn't have the knowledge about index funds I do now, but fortunately my stock picks weren't bad either.  In the end, I essentially matched the S&P 500.  The takeaway here, however, is that **my ridiculous car goal also got me started investing my money.** **because I was already saving and my time horizon was long enough to stomach market variance.**

A byproduct of my investing was that I also had regular conversations with coworkers about investing/personal finance.  I wasn't confident enough to dispense advice, but I enjoyed banter about what stocks people liked, how company X was doing on a given day, etc.  Enter a man named John, who mentioned that I should check out a blog called Mr. Money Mustache.  I must admit I dismissed it at first, strictly based on the name...but his stance on bicycles (ironic, given overarching subject of this post) was what sucked me in.  Then I read [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) and my whole world paradigm changed.  I suddenly gained direction in my life.  Instead of some nebulous concept of working until 65 and then figuring out some form of retirement, I had concrete dollar amount to strive for.  I cut my spending way back, generally grew happier, and greatly accelerated my savings (no longer with the solitary goal of affording that Tesla model S).  **And thus I landed on the path to FI, all from the humble beginnings of trying to buy a car.**

Some of you, especially those familiar with MMM, may now be wondering if I wound up following through with buying that *new, expensive, luxury depreciation-mobile.*  The remainder of that story goes like this:  my goal swapped from a model S to a model 3, as it met my expectations at a more moderate price point than the S.  I put down a day 1 reservation around the time I started reading MMM.  When I was finally notified that I could order one (about 2 years later), I had read quite a number of blog posts from reputable sources vilifying such purchases.  Was I really willing to throw 1/5 of my net worth into something that frivolous?  Could I delay my retirement timeline by about 1 year of savings?  Conversely, was I willing to let go of a goal I'd worked toward for over half a decade? And a chance to support a company doing incredible good for the environment and climate change?  Ultimately...

I did it.  Some things are worth more than cutting a little bit of time off of my retirement timeline.  Like occasionally supporting good companies, decreasing my carbon footprint, and the most utterly absurd and wonderful car I could ever imagine.  I don't regret it (though I'll definitely look to the used electric car market in the future, once enough time has passed for that to be a thing.)

TL;DR:  Young adult starts saving for a Tesla early in his career and happens to stumble into FI circles.

105,I was unemployed for two months. It affirmed my desire to FIRE.,,1276.0,iej9w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iej9w2/i_was_unemployed_for_two_months_it_affirmed_my/,1598106083.0,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share some of my experiences after a brief period of unemployment.

First some background, starting with where my mind was at. I had been working for an engineering company for 4 years and methodically contributing to my accounts in pursuit of FIRE, but I had certain concerns about it on my mind. Sometimes it would be demoralizing to run the numbers and see that FIRE was years off. Sometimes it even felt like it consumed my identity. Like it had become my ambition to watch numbers become bigger on a computer screen, instead of having an enriching career. I say this even as someone who made a conscious effort to try not to worry about it too much and enjoy my precious youth. I have continued to develop strategies to keep my attention on the present and enjoying my youth now.  I also had concerns if I would be able to be happy in a life without work when I did reach the ability to FIRE.

In June I was dismissed from my job. What followed has, in my view, given me the confidence and assuredness to continue on this path. At the time, I was 28 and I had 80k in retirement accounts, 22k cash, and 34k in the stock market, rented a home, and had absolutely zero debt. 

There are two distinct components I‚Äôd like to talk about. The first part of my satisfaction in pursuing FIRE was that I was enormously grateful I had made the choice to save money over the years. From day one, the pressure to resurrect my income was low because I had such a cushion to fall on. Many times over the years I had put money away instead of spending it on toys or even buying myself lunch thinking, ‚ÄúThere may come a day when I wish I had held onto this money for a rainy day.‚Äù Decisions like that compounded. It‚Äôs clear that one of the benefits of FIRE is the freedom that comes even while still pursuing it. However I cannot deny that the additional $600 per week benefit due to the Covid situation was also well-timed and hugely alleviating. I also live with my girlfriend who pays 33% of the home expenses and, given that she is still working from home, could take on more if the situation deteriorated.  Not to mention the stock market exploded.  I admit, I was fortunate in many of my circumstances. 

The second component is how I spent the two months: My days were often spent waking up at 7 am (much improved from 5 am when I was working), prepping breakfast for my girlfriend, listening to political talk radio until 9 am, walking and training my German Shepherd until 10 am, reading books and drinking coffee until noon, using the hot afternoons to go to the gym, clean the house, comfort my girlfriend more as she worked, and then read more. I went for runs at sundown. I researched day-hikes that we could do on the weekend. Sprinkled in there were job applications which ultimately led to me getting a new job in the same area. Therefore, no move will be required. I recognize that here too, I‚Äôm very fortunate.  

While unemployed, I parted with some money to get some festering problems fixed. I spent $800 to fix my car‚Äôs cooling system and now it runs beautifully.  Parting with this much money may be counter to the frugality that unemployment should inspire. But the way I saw it, now I had the time to negotiate with mechanics around town, and get the car fixed up and properly running before the next phase of my life. Not to mention that FIRE again help yield the extra cash that could be expended on these necessities. No longer have to worry about a nuclear meltdown on my car. 

The point is that I felt very satisfied with this lifestyle, not trapped in a hell of purposelessness.  I feel regenerated and rested. Mentally stimulated from all the reading I did. Productive for up-keeping on the house, training my dog, and getting my car fixed. 

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong in this assessment of how things happened. But its made me feel much more assured in my pursuit of this financial security and prospect of being able to stop working. I‚Äôll continue to relish my youth while I have it, but I feel more comfortable than before that the pursuit of FIRE gives me the safety net to absorb hardship along the way, and will give me the lifestyle that I want on the distant horizon.

As a final note, the week after I was released from my job I found a kitten in the road that needed $300 in vet care.  FIRE also allows you absorb the expenses of those who need your help.",108.0,financialindependence
106,Were you happier before discovering FIRE? Ignorance is bliss? Feeling like my obsession with FIRE and money has taken over my life.,,1264.0,kzma15,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kzma15/were_you_happier_before_discovering_fire/,1610941189.0,"TL;DR - My motivation to FIRE has taken over my life to the point where I'm having a hard time enjoying spending my money or the simple joys and journey of life because I see every decision as either helping or harming my ability to FIRE.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

I discovered FIRE about 2-3 years ago after a friend posted an article to a blog post from Millenial Revolution. Luckily enough, I had made some of the right decisions already (i.e. paid off my student loans, contributed to 401k up to match), but after I discovered FIRE and calculated that I could retire early in 7 years, I started to aggressively save, dumped every spare dollar into index funds, and lowered all my expenses.

I hit $500K in net worth last month and it was a satisfying number to look at, yet as I was scrolling through old photos of myself from 5-7 years ago, I realized I wasn't necessarily happier for it. Over the past 2 years, I realized I've become more annoyed with work, and paralyzed or fearful of making any decisions that jeopardize my ability to FIRE. In the past, I would happily book an expensive, peak-season flight to an international country, buy a new camera just because I wanted it and I would be driven and motivated at work, exhibiting all the behaviors I needed to land that next promotion.

But since discovering FIRE, I haven't taken any international trips, haven't bought anything that's expensive yet could further my hobbies or interests (e.g. new camera for photography, roof rack for car), and outright stopped caring about work to the point where my attitude towards it has become bitter and resentful. I figure if I just coast at my job for the next few years, I'll hit my FIRE goal within 5-7 years. But it is actually out of character for me to care so little about my career and feel so apathetic. My coworkers are pretty surprised and baffled at my apathy towards work.

I'm seeing every single decision I make is either for or against achieving FIRE. Have a baby? But that might push out my FIRE date. Buy a house? It would be a dumb decision in NYC based on all the blog posts I've read. Hold a wedding? How many more years will I need to work? Buy a new laptop? But that's $XXXXX lost if I invested it in the market instead. Get a new job? Why bother, I just need to suck it up for 5 more years. Etc. Etc.

Now I'm wondering if I would've been happier if I didn't discover FIRE at all... If I was ignorant? I see some friends who have no idea what FIRE is happily enjoying their money and their life and I am jealous of them. I feel like it's become a mental restraint I've placed on myself. And these next 5 years feel like they're going to be pretty miserable until I can hit my FIRE #.

Any suggestions on how to break out of this mindset would be appreciated!",497.0,financialindependence

I‚Äôm using a baby account for this because anonymous isn‚Äôt quite anonymous enough as nobody outside my family knows, really.

I‚Äôve technically been FI for about 8 years. I didn‚Äôt have any plans to retire insanely early and was using my degrees and working in software (big surprise lol). I honestly didn‚Äôt learn of the whole FIRE movement until about the time I retired.

I retired in 2nd quarter of 2018 at 36. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. A lot had gone on in my family and my company was going through another big change cycle (My team had turned over 3x and management 5x in the 5 years I was there), I was overwhelmed and burnt out. I had a month-long trip planned for Nov. of that year and thought the summer/fall would be a nice break. I put in my two weeks planning to just putter around and focus on my mental health until that trip.  I had fully planned to start job searching upon my return.

I did not start job searching upon my return. I figured I‚Äôd enjoy the holidays as hiring is slow then anyway and start job searching in January. Cue more family stuff happening so I decided to wait a bit longer and had another month-long trip planned in April so figured I‚Äôd just wait.  I actually ended up purchasing a house and started renovations before I left for my trip.

I returned from said trip and I did not start job searching. I think the reality was that I had no desire to go back to the 9-5 grind. I decided to focus on the house and moving. I finally moved and took time to enjoy my new house.

Heading towards the latter part of last year, I started feeling like I was missing something. I didn‚Äôt want to start applying for career jobs in my field as I planned to continue longer travels a few times a year (hahahahaha) and the thought of going back to the everyday stress and drudgery was too much.  I thought about signing up with a temp agency or finding somewhere to volunteer on a more regular basis but didn‚Äôt make much of my thoughts as it was holiday time once again and figured the new year might bring some inspiration.

In Feb. I got in a quick trip and was supposed to be leaving shortly after for 6 weeks of travel but all hell broke loose. I know the state of the world the last 6 months is probably amplifying things (and I do want to state that I know I‚Äôm actually insanely lucky to be in the situation I am with everything), but the feelings of just sort of floating around predate all of that.

Looking at the timeline described here, it seems like there was a fair amount happening, and there was, but without a job the time between big events just sort of is. I haven‚Äôt felt passionate enough to stick to any long term projects and filling the days with random activities becomes really unfulfilling after awhile.

I guess after writing all of this, the advice of make sure you retire to something is very valid. I didn‚Äôt plan on retiring so I also didn‚Äôt plan what that would look like for the next several decades or even few years. That feels like a bit of a mistake.

Editing to add - it‚Äôs a very weird place to feel incredibly free like you could do anything and still stagnant and unable to decide what that thing is.

I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions and an open to any and all advice!

I live with no other humans and one assholish but adorable doge if that matters.

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this many responses.

Adding as it‚Äôs come up in a few of the comments I‚Äôve seen. I do see a psychiatrist/therapist for anxiety/OCD and insomnia (nothing physically wrong, had sleep issues since my early teens).  I don‚Äôt really fit diagnostic criteria for depression, though covid is causing something in a lot of people.

Also, it‚Äôs not a lack of happiness, it‚Äôs a lack of direction and, to me, there‚Äôs a huge difference between the two. I‚Äôm not unhappy. Just aimless.

Edit 2 - wow this blew up overnight. I never expected so much response. I‚Äôm trying to read through and respond to questions

A couple of points
- am female (not surprising as I didn‚Äôt mention in the OP and this sub skews very male)
- The thing I‚Äôm missing is not a baby, I promise üòÇ I‚Äôm really surprised that So many people suggested this since this sub tends to be very anti-marriage/child free! Maybe it‚Äôs the people who guessed I‚Äôm a woman? ü§î
- I very much need to google and read up on Disc Golf, it seems to be the unofficial sport(?) of FI

I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs, married, and a business owner. Just north of $1m in index funds saved and have a couple of years living expenses in cash. Was making about $300k yearly in a LCOL area. 

Pre-Covid, I put up a dramatic post about how I have been having mental breakdowns, my marriage is crumbling, all I do is work 24/7, and my life is miserable. I want more than anything to FIRE but should probably start COASTing so I don‚Äôt completely break down. 

Since then, my business had been mandated closed for over six months and is, just now, on the precipice of reopening. 

After six months of no-salary, reflecting, panicking, stressing, relaxing, and going through every emotion you can imagine, I have a new mindset. 

I could technically COAST right now and just earn living expenses for the next 15-20 years. We don‚Äôt spend frivolously, as evidenced by six months of a shutdown. I‚Äôm reopening my business now and it looks like I will be starting around $75-80k yearly, working a dramatically reduced scheduled. 

Before, I would have panicked at this, but I actually feel an ease at the idea that as long as I cover living expenses, my family and I will be ok. I will work on maximizing profit, inside my limited schedule only, and anything extra can always go into savings. Maybe I‚Äôll be able to FIRE earlier than 15-20 years, who knows?! The whole situation plucked me from the rat race for a period of time and I just feel more relaxed and less pressure to SAVE SAVE SAVE EARN EARN EARN SAVE SAVE EARN EARN WORK NONSTOP WORRY WORRY SAVE EARN SAVE EARN

Simply, I was grinding myself to death, in an attempt to FIRE, and now I feel like I‚Äôd rather enjoy life a little bit. It‚Äôs a mental adjustment, but I‚Äôm starting to feel ok with it now. I was so wrapped up in money, that I forgot how nice it felt to sit down and eat dinner with my wife, go for a long walk, read a book, etc.

Anyone who can achieve stable employment can, theoretically, achieve FIRE - but most don't.

I just came across this long article on the subject - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/

The author lists 20 ""flaws, biases, and causes of bad behaviour"". Any resonate with you - it certainly made me pat myself on the back a few times, which makes me suspect there's a few here that I'm just currently blind to in my own life!?

1. Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.

2. Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a reward.

3. Rich man in the car paradox. (You don't admire the man, you think people would admire you if you were the man.)

4. A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult, resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding rewards that come from current decisions.

5. Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what‚Äôs happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

6. Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is the lifeblood of progress.

7. The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.

8. Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear terms.

9. Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian thinking to achieve above-average results.

10. An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean rules but loose and unpredictable trends.

11. The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money; wealth is what you don‚Äôt see.

12. A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

13. Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally and physically.

14. A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.

15. An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.

16. Optimism bias in risk-taking, or ‚ÄúRussian Roulette should statistically work‚Äù syndrome: An over attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.

17. A preference for skills in a field where skills don‚Äôt matter if they aren‚Äôt matched with the right behavior.

18. Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the inherent complexities of everything involving money.

19. Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.

20. The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your future.

tldr from the author: ""If there‚Äôs a common denominator in these, it‚Äôs a preference for humility, adaptability, long time horizons, and skepticism of popularity around anything involving money. Which can be summed up as: Be prepared to roll with the punches.""",178.0,financialindependence

I was one of five children living with my mom who never graduated from high school. She was a waitress, worked in a store, did odd jobs. I was the youngest kid, and I remember being 12 years old when I got my first pair of shoes that were my very own new shoes, not hand me downs. I remember being arrested for shoplifting when I was 10, and how my mom broke down when she found out I had been stealing school supplies. She wanted us all to go to college. Most of us did. When I was in college on a scholarship, she finally graduated from high school by studying for and passing her GED. She got a job at the county as a clerk, which was the first stable job she ever had.

Two years after I got my Ph.D., I had a brand new townhouse built for her. She got to pick out the granite for the countertops and the fixtures for the bathrooms and the wall color.

I Tell my salesman that I‚Äôm coming by at noon to pick up my new 2020 Z900. I sold my bike before I deployed and I‚Äôve been itching to get another. Finally, I decided to take the plunge. I sent him pictures of my license info whatever he needed. At 9:53.... I‚Äôm laid off permanently. No furlough, just done. And then I‚Äôm humiliated by my boss escorting me to my desk to get my crap and leave. Then an hour later, I was called by my co worker and was told the same happened to him and two others. After it was all said and done, seven good people lost their jobs in an instant. No warning or indication. All company emails are saying how good the company is doing now and how much business we are booking. But all the answers we got during our separation was corporate restructuring. Now where am I going with this? I‚Äôm glad you asked.

I am currently not worried. Maybe a little? But I‚Äôm sleeping just fine knowing I have around a quarter million I can withdraw from. I know not everyone is as fortunate as me. There are so many families out there that are struggling because they have no savings or investments like many of us do in this community. I would be petrified if I was in that situation. 

The idea of financial independence is so powerful and I wish it was taught in the school system. Workers should not have to be so dependent on employers and get cast aside so easily. It‚Äôs BS. I know I‚Äôm not special by any means, but so many days I put in at the office and over time worked just to be cast out like garbage. It hurts bad. Overall, I‚Äôm just saying spread the message of financial independence. You could end up saving a family from extreme hardship.

Instead I went back through old posts and just pondered on how the sub had changed since it started.

First lets teleport back to 9 years ago, the world is falling apart due to the Arab spring, but Osama‚Äôs dead, the London Olympics is around the corner and the UK and US are looking like they are recovering, curiosity rover landed on mars. Around 1000 subscribers on the¬†financialindependence sub:

The financial crisis is still ringing in the back of your head, you knew people who seemed well off who lost their jobs and houses, the job market has been shit for a while. My parents sold all their shares in 2008/2009 and had three 0% down repayment mortgages for example (it was common knowledge in 2006 that it was a¬†guaranteed way to be rich, reminds me of tesla/bitcoin). However, green shoots have been spreading for a while, 2010 wasn‚Äôt too bad really, 2011 is going great. The market is still two thirds below 2008 levels.

You most probably read earlyretirementextreme or thesimpledollar,¬†you most probably had read your money or your life, the millionaire next door or a random walk down wall street. You might have somehow found the bogleheads forum and got linked¬† through to reddit. I personally couldn‚Äôt find any of these resources and was looking at Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, Forex trading, buying houses etc.

So what are the main beliefs and thoughts? The main themes on the subreddit is sustainability, frugalness, being happier with less. I really think that‚Äôs a reflection of the time and points in a good way to survivorship bias. The best examples of people who had stayed the course were frugal and lived below their means, they had diversified assets. Index funds werent¬†anywhere near as popular then either so it was much harder to not lose everything in the GFC, but some people were on the index fund train and were comfortable enough to power through. The only real way people could have done that is cut expenses and live within your means.

Heres some example posts. Note all the comments are about living happily with less.

Zoom forward a couple of years to joining at the start of 2015, the world isnt really falling apart yet until next year (BoJo and Trump arent taken seriously), uptown funk hit number 1, Game of Thrones anyone? I think this sub hit 100,000 subscribers around then:

The stock market is on an absolute tear, its¬†finally surpassed its 2008 highs in 2014. The mood everywhere is pretty good, house prices have done very well in cities and recovered in most suburbs. The common person has started feeling ok about stocks again but has no idea what an index fund is, stocks are still considered pretty dangerous if you speak to your¬†uncle. I distinctly remember reading lots of articles (maybe slightly earlier) that Amazon was a bad investment as it didn‚Äôt make profit, dividend paying stocks like utilities, oil and tobacco were the game of the day. I personally had made some disastrous plays into renewable energy stocks around 2014/15 as I was trying to be sustainable.

You definitely read mrmoneymustache, probably religiously. You probably post here and read some of the other various blogs in the side bar (frugalwoods, jlcollions, getrichslowly etc.). You may have found the sub through some kooky articles on CNBC or the BBC. The book selections¬†havent really changed much at all.

Main conversation points? Frugality is still the name of the day. Living a happy and sustainable life. Riding bicycles everywhere and doing your own repairs. 4% rule is king. Some dissenting opinions are brewing about how incredulous it is to retire on $600,000, but the conversation is very polite. The veterans' portfolios are really starting to bear fruit and gain notoriety after investing through the downturn (or at least not selling and cutting down expenses).

I really enjoyed reading some of the top posts from this year.

Your mate might even be sitting pretty on 5 bitcoins and some tesla stock. Instead of instilling fear the crash has instilled confidence. Every man and his dog has some ETF ‚ÄòIndex‚Äô funds. Turns out renewables and Amazon were the right call, go figure. Still, I have more money than the people at work bragging about bitcoin, not that I tell them. If I‚Äôd invested in index funds in 2011, not 2014/5, rather than a house, individual shares etc. I‚Äôd be richer. If I‚Äôd not invested in a second property after that I‚Äôd be a lot less stressed at the least.

More than likely you found the site through somebody linking through to the sub, it might have even popped up on your feed. Theres a plethora of blogs and youtube channels, you might listen to choosefi, but just as likely other investing podcasts. The dinosaur blogger portfolios have hit unimaginable heights. Mostly they seem pretty bored of blogging now and rarely post. You probably work in software, you really might just be browsing around and shaking your head at the incredible wealth, you might equally have come and cannot fathom why people think 10% returns are good, you might equally also think 4% of your portfolio sounds risky.

Conversation points now? Money is king. Lots more people that have stayed the course. It‚Äôs very common to be told that your portfolio isnt enough, its also pretty common to have to defend some luck you‚Äôve had. A lot of portfolios are bitcoin and meme stocks, but still really the minority on this sub. I personally hide out in leanfire in my safe space.

I‚Äôd like to think people were arguing about shiller cape ratios, but not really.  The estimates of FIRE have definitely ballooned.

Now what‚Äôs my point? My original thinking was to write this for my own benefit. But also just show people it‚Äôs important to run their own race and be nice to each other, but to also think in terms of decades rather than thinking in the present. It took 6 years for the stock market to recover in 2008, this time it took 6 months. So much happens, so many plans seem incredulous but work out, some people get lucky, some people don‚Äôt. The people that have stayed the course are more than likely frugal, more than likely good at sticking to an achievable plan, and more than likely good at tracking things so they can adjust quickly. However some people stayed rich from the 2000‚Äôs housing boom the same way some people will stay rich from bitcoin and the 1990s tech stock boom. This fact is not my problem, I have a plan and I‚Äôm sticking to it. I had to message my dad regularly in March not to sell, although thankfully this time he had a competent financial advisor that he actually listened to rather than his son.

Where will you be in 9 years? It‚Äôs good to think about that.

Journey, thoughts, and numbers below.

Journey before destination.

#This is way longer than I intended; it also has all the info in it I enjoy hearing about other people‚Äôs FIRE journeys. . . sorry for the length.

###Background (Skip this if you want; I enjoy reading these, so I lay it out for others)

I had terrible money habits growing up: they continued until I was 26.  *Really* bad.  I grew up on foodstamps, and we never had *any* excess money; anything that came in went right back out on expenses.  I‚Äôd like to say they were necessities, but looking back. . . I think we could have done a lot better.  The scarcity mindset that living at the financial edge instills is real, and I continued to spend every dollar available to me (by work or by loan) until I stumbled across FIRE.  Constantly racked up credit card debt, and took every dollar that was ever available on student loans.

I regret taking the amount of student loans we did; we could have done less (though not anywhere near zero)  They say ‚ÄúThat first 100K is hardest‚Äù, but it‚Äôs really that ‚ÄúThat first 100K from *zero* is hardest‚Äù because if you hit a low point of -172,000, compound interest doesn‚Äôt really help you for that first 272K. . .

Income/expenses listed are at the end of that calendar year.

* *2011, age 24:*

Graduated in 2011 with a Civil Engineering Degree, wife was a student, working on a Masters in Public Health.  This was the absolute peak of the financial crisis for engineering.  I took a (not quite full time) temp job as a web developer making $20/hr, and we maxed out taking my wife‚Äôs student loans:

**Income: 31K me, 0K wife, 31K comb  ||  Exp: ~40K  ||  NW: -$163,000**

* *2012:*

Wife graduated grad school halfway through the year and got a fellowship for $24/hr.  My temp work finished halfway through the year, and I ‚Äòworked‚Äô full-time applying to engineering jobs.  Finally got one after a few hundred resumes, but wouldn‚Äôt start until just into the new year, 2013.  Which left that year at:

**Income: 12K me, 26K wife, 38K comb   ||  Expenses: ~40K  ||  NW: -$172,000**

* *2013, age 26: the tipping point year for FIRE*

Note that we *moved significanly backwards* the previous year in net worth due to student loan interest and spending. . .

Started a job as an engineer!  $52k per year ($25/hr).  Straight salary, with a terrible (in retrospect) company.  Worked a *ton* of hours, but only got paid the base salary.  I shudder to think what my hourly rate (working a lot of 70 hour weeks) actually was averaged over this year. . .  Still a financial step up!

**Discovered FIRE.**  I cannot stress enough how big of a change this made for my wife and me.  My wife was naturally a frugal person (I was *not*) but we both had otherwise terrible habits.  Once about my third real check rolled in I googled ‚ÄúStudent Loan Repayment‚Äù and in the process of trying to find a more robust calculator (I was looking for, essentially, [unbury.us](http://unbury.us), though I didn‚Äôt know at that time it existed) and happened to stumble across Mr. Money Mustache in February.

I would like to pause for a minute to point out how terrible of a name this is:  I can credit this one website with legitimately changing my life in a very positive way, but if I ever try to explain what this life-altering blog was, it‚Äôs. . . mister money mustache.  Sigh.

I was consumed.  In less than a month I had read everything (and I mean *everything*) on MMM, MadFientist, and JL Collins; I devoured *Your Money or Your Life*, *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and *The Richest Man in Babylon*.  My wife and I planned out our financial goals (Get student loan free, then try to retire in 15 years; will finish well ahead of this) and drastically reduced expenses.  Started aggressively paying down student loans by ‚Äòminimum payment amount‚Äô first to reduce our DTI ratio, hoping to qualify for a mortgage.

I became obsessed with the idea of having a miniature empire of rental units that would help me reach FI faster: small, clean, well-maintained places that I loved and the tenants loved.  Planned to ‚Äòhouse hack‚Äô by getting a duplex and living in half ‚Äì the worse shape the better!  I‚Äôd always been handy, I was looking forward to sweat equity.  Started looking for a house in May.

Got married in July of this year; I suppose all previous references to ‚Äòwife‚Äô should read fianc√© before this. . .

**Bought a duplex:** We were approved for a mortgage due to having some *long* repayment lengths on student loans which kept our DTI ratio on *just* the right side of acceptable, and bought an absolute shithole of a duplex with 3% down in November in a pretty nice neighborhood in Minneapolis.  This was $196K, which seemed *really* high from the lows of 2009; that sounds funny in retrospect now looking back, but everyone was worried it was the midst of a second bubble at the time.  Moved in to one half, and inherited some tenants in the other.  Started rapidly fixing it up with every spare hour I had, as I was still working about 60 hours a week on average.

It was a busy year.

**Income: 52K me, 44K wife, 96K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$140,000**

* *2014:*

Hey, the NW is moving the right direction!!  But now we reach ‚Äúthe boring middle‚Äù part of FIRE.  My wife got a full time job with benefits (as opposed to a fellowship) with a pay bump.  I got a 12% raise from my terrible company, mostly in response to threatening to leave due to working conditions.  Working conditions did not improve.  At the end of the year I switched companies (wont‚Äô be reflected in this years salary) to the place I‚Äôm still with.  They are a hugely better company to work for, and they pay for *every* hour I work.  The pay was about the same per hour, but since I was working 60hr/week I essentially got a 50% raise.

We began to live on just my wife‚Äôs paycheck, and used 100% of mine to pay off student loans/invest.  This hasn‚Äôt changed to this day. . . except we now also invest some of hers.

**Income: 58K me, 56K wife, 114K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$97,000**

More of the same, paying off student loans in 2016, continuing the aggressive saving until 2020. . .

* *2016:* **Income: 86K me, 70K wife, 156K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$33,000**

* *2017:* **Income: 101K me, 72K wife, 173K comb   ||  Expenses: ~60K  ||  NW: $45,000**

* *2019:* **Income: 92K me, 75K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $300,000**

* *2020:* **Income: 110K me, 76K wife, 186K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $700K**

Note that NW has some weird jumps once we got past zero because the duplex went from essentially zero cash flow (lot of costs going in tended to burn all the rental income) to positive cash flow as we started to wrap the years of renovations, to a huge jump upon sale.

 
###2020:  Deciding to Simplify (Start again here, this is the point of the post!)

We had a kid.  

I had already been getting worn out of rental maintenance, especially as we had moved out of the duplex entirely and were renting both halves, now that it was nice.  Working a ton, and feeling like between a (more than) full time job, child, and rental, something had to give.  It was amazingly difficult to find a decent rental manager.

Our personal expenses had slowly shrunk down to be about $4,000/month, $1,500 of which was the mortgage on our new house.  In addition were the duplex costs, and the possibility that I had to have enough cash reserves to cover three furnaces, three water heaters, three stoves; also potential vacancies, other big ticket items (like a $14,000 roof job on the duplex, water damage from ice dams, etc) that were always potentially looming.

The rental income *did* cover these expenses: The duplex was working as a business.  But I was having basically $7,000 a month in expenses despite a fairly frugal lifestyle that had to be covered; **$84,000 a year that *had* to be earned and burned no matter what.**  My wife took a big chunk of time off for maternity, and I wanted to do significantly less, but this ‚Äòburn rate‚Äô was weighing on me.

Our three biggest expenses were the duplex, our house, and taxes.  Taxes are as low as they can be (all tax-advantaged accounts maxed out) and I‚Äôm happy to give back to the education and food programs that helped me, growing up.  But, I could sell the duplex, and roll all the profit into the new mortgage, and potentially go from needing to earn and burn $84,000 per year to $30,000. . .
 
###Rent out vs. Sell

I ran the numbers on if I kept the duplex, vs selling and investing it in the stock market.  I looked over the the next 6 years, which is about/past my FIRE date.  My estimated net worth difference would be around $80,000!  Nothing to sneeze at!  However, it also would be the difference between ~$1.3M and ~1.2M, both of which are over my FIRE number of $950K for 3.25% SWR.  If this had been the difference between $0 and $100K, that‚Äôd be huge.  That 1st 100K is the hardest.  The 13th 100K, however, is not.

I also had the added wrinkle that if we sold in 2020, it counts as a primary residence, and we don‚Äôt pay gains tax on the part we had lived in two of the last five years; this reduced the calculated 80k difference.

**Purposeful ‚ÄúMistake‚Äù number 1: The duplex is gone.**

Was it worth an 8% reduction in net worth in 6 years to me to not have to deal with the rental property with a young child or two?  A thousand times yes.  I will have, I think, significantly less wealth in 30 years because I sold the rental duplex back in July.  But I will have *enough* either way, and I shall never get these years back.

I think buying, renovating, and renting that duplex was the best single financial action I ever took.  I‚Äôm happy I ground it out and did the completely hellish task of gutting a 110 year old building in the evenings around a 60hr/week job.  I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever do it again. . .

### Pay off Mortgage vs Invest

What about, now that I‚Äôve sold the duplex, putting it all in the market vs. paying off our home mortgage?  The numbers are pretty simple:  

5% real returns in the stock market (8% returns, 3% inflation, assumed).  Mortgage was, by happenstance, almost the same amount we got out in cash from the duplex, $153K.  We would then not have to pay the $1500/month that was going to principal and interest, and could invest that.  All number ‚Äì as always ‚Äì in 2021 dollars for simplicity.

* $153K invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $205k.
* $1,500/month invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $125K.
* A difference of, again, $80,000.  At least I‚Äôm consistent. . .

This one was much harder; I really wanted to reduce my ‚Äòburn rate‚Äô, but this basically means that selling the duplex **and** using that to immediately pay off my mortgage made us (statistically) $160,000 poorer in about 6 years, another $80k of gains gone.

However, despite me not believing (allegedly) in timing the market, the CAPE is currently quite high. . . and I‚Äôm getting awfully close to being able to FIRE anyways, 4-8 years, pending variables.  I also intend to transition my 100% equities to a [100/60/100 V-shaped Bond Glide]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) to maximize safety at the cost of potential gains.  I also believe that [it doesn‚Äôt make sense to carry a mortgage into early or regular retirement]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/10/11/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-21-mortgage-in-retirement/).  These aren‚Äôt just numbers in a spreadsheet, I actually have to be able to shift the funds to be able to do this, in a way that‚Äôs not crippling from a tax perspective.  It‚Äôs going to take years to shift to a bond allocation slowly; trying to pay the mortgage off at the same time could very well be impossible.

I don‚Äôt have a target FIRE date; I intend to work less and less as I slide into ER, and having the mortgage paid off means that my wife and I can do this whenever we want, without having to do 5 years of financial maneuvering in the background to ‚Äòpull the trigger‚Äô.  

The flexibility is worth it.  **Purposeful ‚ÄúMistake‚Äù number 2: The mortgage is gone.**.

We now live very comfortable ‚Äì I would say luxurious ‚Äì lives on about $2,500/month.  This will increase sporadically for large trips and childcare, but is our past and current expenses, and will be further in the future too.  I intend to build a fairly large cushion in passive income over this for unforeseen events, then charity, if those don‚Äôt materialize, but we don‚Äôt feel impoverished in any way at this spending level.

We are privileged enough, lucky enough, and determined enough to now be making about $45/hr each gross, $36/hour each takehome.  This means we need to work a combined 70 hours in a month to be able to cover our expenses; that‚Äôs 35 hours each, or  an average about 8 hours *a week* throughout the year.  We are primed to be able to slowly ‚ÄúBaristaFIRE‚Äù with reduced hours and benefits in our current jobs, which we both (mostly) enjoy.  

We will both be only when we want ‚Äì which might be not at all ‚Äì by age 40.  If you had asked me at 25 if this was possible, I would have laughed in your face.",328.0,financialindependence

I grew up elsewhere in the Rust Belt, in an economically stagnant area -- and by that, I mean the median family income in this city last year was $24,000, and the median home value sits around $40,000. My family clocked in at about 2x both of those figures, which represents the approximate average for a family of four in the US. However, by my town's standards, we led a comfortable middle-class life.

My upbringing makes me think of one of most common criticisms of the FIRE concept: that FIRErs are  mainly high-income earners that happen to live in LCOL areas, and that this isn't as obtainable for those without high incomes or those whose jobs can only be done in or around H/MCOL markets. I'm not rich, but I pulled in about $63k last year. Not stellar, and slightly above average for the US as a whole, but not bad for a 27-year old with a mediocre accounting degree from a Tier 4 state school, and a pretty far cry from my hometown's median of $24k. My job can be done remotely from anywhere, which allows me to live in a $900/month apartment about 45 minutes from the city with no roommates and no family to provide for, and save roughly 30-50% of my take-home pay depending on the month. I've been dealt a pretty favorable hand as far as income goes, and that level of privilege is what makes me think about how the FIRE concept relates to the US as a whole, even pre-COVID. It seems to be that a lot of the FIRE literature is aimed at people who are already middle to upper-middle class, but who have a spendy lifestyle that keeps them from accumulating wealth. Oh, if only they could get out of their BMW lease or their Starbucks habit, and FI would be theirs...or such is the theme of all of these books.

It makes me chuckle a little when I hear things like ""cook all your meals at home! Take public transit! Exercise in the park instead of paying for a gym! Use your library instead of buying books/DVDs!"" because in my neck of the woods, ***everybody was already doing that***. Not as a lifestyle choice -- it was their *only* lifestyle choice.

It's this reality that makes me think twice when I hear Millionaire-Next-Door-esque comments like ""anyone can FIRE if you work hard enough."" While that is theoretically true, there's no escaping the reality not everyone is running this race out of the same gate. My quick and dirty calculations would have more more-or-less leanfire at 50, or FIRE at 55 or so, without taking into account Social Security or FERS pension. This is so far removed from the reality in my hometown that it isn't even funny, where most young workers live hand-to-mouth and retirees live entirely on SS. I'm not doing anything they are not doing; practically the only difference is that I was able to increase my income to a slightly-above average level that is honestly not that impressive on the national scale.

I'm not sure if comments or thoughts like this are typical of FIRErs, especially those from bottom-quartile income backgrounds, and I'm wondering what, if anything, we as a FIRE community should be doing to improve access to financial education for the country at large.

I‚Äôm 34, male, single and as of 1 November this year, I have officially been FIREd for 1 year.  I did not create a FIRE post when I pulled the trigger because I actually was laid off from my last job a couple years before I had originally planned to FIRE.  I did not really feel motivated to look for another job right away so after looking over my finances, I determined that I was leanFIRE ready and decided to go for it.  I chose to use my first post-FIRE year to determine a. Whether my lifestyle was financially viable and sustainable, and b. Whether I actually enjoyed the FIRE lifestyle.  After 1 year the answer to both these questions is YES and here is my 1 year post-FIRE report.  It‚Äôs going to be lengthy.

&#x200B;

**Brief bullet point breakdown of how I reached FIRE:**

\-9 years in the Army as an Officer after I graduated college, 3.5 years of that spent overseas (combat deployments earn bonus pay and salary is not taxed)

\-Low spending, high savings, aggressive investment into the stock market starting in 2009 (almost exclusively index funds), and all throughout the bull market recovery over the following 10 years.  Savings rate ranged from roughly 30% (early in my career) to 95% (during a year of combat deployment in which I spent almost no money as I was living in an Army base in the desert with no bills to pay and not much to spend money on)

\-Always looked for ways to save money, cut my own hair, made my own lunches, took advantage of military benefits such as the GI Bill to further my education for free, didn‚Äôt make a purchase if there was a free/cheaper alternative etc.

\-Left the Army due to health issues, received military disability, which makes me eligible for VA healthcare as well as receiving a monthly disability check.

\-Got a job as a manager for a manufacturing company for 1 year after the Army, but was then laid off due to restructuring.  Decided to leanFIRE early after that as opposed to finding another job for another couple years.

&#x200B;

**Major financial events over the last year (tldr at the end):**

**Buying a new property:**

So, after I decided to FIRE, my first major decision was to buy a permanent home as I had been renting all of my professional career due to moving a lot in the Army.  I decided to purchase a duplex/multi family property so that I could live in one unit and rent out the other for additional income.  I ended up getting one for cheap because the previous owners had not maintained it well and it needed a lot of cosmetic work, but structurally it was fine.

The building had 2 apartments, a 1200 square foot apartment that a family of long term renters lived in (they had lived there 12 years and raised their kids there, they had paid rent on time and taken pretty good care of their apartment, at least considering how little the landlord had done).  It did have a number of issues though, they had pipe leaks, a broken dishwasher, a toilet that needed replacing, a few holes in the walls that had never been patched up etc.

The other unit was an 800 square foot apartment that was in very bad shape, lots of water damage/mold that needed to be completely renovated (walls, floors, kitchen/bathroom cabinets) pretty much the entire apartment needed to be stripped down and redone.  There was also work that needed to be done on the outside of the house such as broken gutters, a broke down shed in the back that was just a pile of scrap and other stuff.

The property was valued at approximately $117,000 according to tax estimates, the owner had it on sale for $111,000, and it had been listed for almost half a year (most people don‚Äôt want to own a duplex and have to fix up a lot of issues after buying a house).  After a lot of haggling back and forth, I bought the property as is for $90,000.  This also is why there is a jagged ‚Äúslice‚Äù in the first part of my net worth chart, where I sold investments and then added the value of the property shortly after.

The negotiations took place at the end of 2019, but I scheduled the actual sale to happen in January, reason being was I was planning on selling off investments to pay for the house in cash, but as I would be earning no salary in 2020, my taxes would be very low for my long term capital gains.  Everything with the sale went smoothly.  I worked with a real estate agent that I got through a Army Veterans housing program who had worked with Soldiers before, solid guy, would recommend.

**Renovation and Flooding:**

From January through May I had the house renovated, fixed a LOT of issues.  Everything was perfect, I fixed all the major issues in the renter‚Äôs apartment (they were very happy) and completely redid the 800 foot apartment which I was going to move into, new floors, walls, ceiling, kitchen, bathroom etc.  Took a video of a walk through of it to show off to my family and had my move in date scheduled.

The DAY BEFORE I was supposed to move in, the area was hit by the worst flooding in about 14 years.  While the flood did not directly flood the area where my house was, it turns out there is a drain right outside my apartment (which is much lower elevation than the tenants apartment) that led straight to the river, when the river flooded it pushed water up the drain and into my apartment.  I rushed down to find 4 inches of standing water in my brand new apartment.  I cancelled the move, bought a pump to get the water out and called servpro for water damage cleanup.  Brand new flooring and cabinets had to be replaced and the walls had to be cut into about halfway up because they had soaked up too much water.  This was not only expensive but soul crushing as well, my brand new apartment was wrecked.

Second renovations happened from May-June, I salvaged what I could.  I didn‚Äôt want to buy brand new cabinets/counters all over again so I reused what I could, but it definitely lost a lot of the ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù feeling that it had had before.

Anyway, the move in finally happened at the end of June.  I had also been renting an apartment during the whole renovation process, so was paying rent and apartment utilities from November 2019 through July 2020 on top of everything else.

**Tldr:**

Bought a duplex for $90,000, valued at $117,000, but it needed a lot of repairs/renovations.  Long term tenants already living in one unit.

Spent roughly $23,000 on the first set of renovations to fix up both apartments.

Area flooded, flooding my new apartment.

Spent roughly $17,500 on the post flood cleanup and second round of renovations 

See expenses/earnings spreadsheet linked at the top of this post for more details.

Also spent roughly $7,000 on rent and utilities from November through July for a place to stay while renovating the new place.

Amazingly, even though I was spending a large amount of money during this time, my net worth still continued to increase (see the net worth chart) thanks to the market continuing to grow.

&#x200B;

**Current financial situation (see earning/spending spreadsheet for full budget breakdown):**

Current annual income (Sources are Investment dividends/interest, rent and military disability):

\~$31,000

Estimated annual expenses (not including unplanned expenses)

\~$15,000

After all the ridiculous amount of spending I did during the first half of the year (And also why I do not have a spending tracking chart as it would look bonkers) I have now settled down into a regular schedule.  I am continuing to be thrifty, as it‚Äôs the lifestyle I‚Äôve lived for the last 10 years and is routine now.  Thanks to my 3 streams of passive income I am now actually generating more income than expenses.

I‚Äôve tried to make my budget as detailed in terms of planned expenses as I can, but there will always be outliers.  For example, due to how unusual my finances are this year (no salary, huge sale of investments, purchase of property and many tax deductible repairs) I‚Äôm hiring a CPA to do my taxes for the first time.  It will cost $400 for him to do my taxes, and I also had a 1 hour meeting with him in which I asked him a whole bunch of tax related questions regarding my current citation, which cost another $200.  After this year I expect I should be able to go back to doing my own taxes as I have in years past, so this expense is something that lies outside my normal planned budget.  But even with these one time/unexpected expenses, I‚Äôm still very much in the green in terms of my budget.

&#x200B;

**Satisfaction with the FIRE lifestyle:**

I am a very unusual person, in that I am quite happy being by myself 95% of the time.  I‚Äôm also very easy to keep entertained.  Books/audio books, movies, TV shows, games, most of my entertainment is digital.  And it‚Äôs actually only in the last year that I‚Äôve realized just how vast the amount of entertainment that there is available.  I‚Äôve got a giant list of TV shows, movies, books, games that I‚Äôve been interested in consuming, and if anything that list has only gotten bigger over the last year.

I also find myself mini-side projects to occupy myself with. For example,  I joined an online consulting website early in the year where you post your resume and companies will contact you if they want to get feedback/testing on a product/website/procedure that they have.  Given my experience in the military and logistics, I was able to enter a few of these interviews/testings, and also make a bit of money on the side doing it.  Naturally, as my skills deteriorate, I‚Äôll be less eligible for this type of thing but it was fun.

Over the last year, I honestly can‚Äôt think of a single moment where I thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, I‚Äôve got nothing to do‚Äù.  If anything I‚Äôve spent many late nights absorbed in something (which is ok since I can wake up whenever I feel like it now).

And afternoon naps, they are a thing that I love so much.  When I was in the military I would typically get up around 5:30-6:00 in the morning, go exercise with my unit for an hour, then shower/change and jump into the work day.  It would usually be right after lunch when things had calmed down a bit that I would usually start to get drowsy and would have to stay on my feet so that I wouldn‚Äôt risk dozing off if I sat down.  Now if I‚Äôm tired after lunch, I can take a nap and it‚Äôs awesome.  It does wreck my sleep schedule on occasion though.

Retiring right into the middle of a pandemic has not been ideal of course.  I did want to travel a bit after retirement, there are a number of annual conventions/conferences I‚Äôve always been interested in but never attended due to my focus on work.  They are a no-go this year and probably next year as well.  The same goes for socializing, while I‚Äôm perfectly happy to be alone most of the time I do occasionally want to engage in social activities.  When I was in college I was big into pen and paper role playing games with a group of friends but have not gotten involved in it since then.  There are a couple gaming stores in town but they have shut down during the pandemic.  Fortunately I found a website that lets you form/find groups of people to play with online, and there are a number of digital tools that let you create characters, maps, roll dice etc.  So I‚Äôm now part of a weekly online gaming group that are currently deep into our first campaign together.  It‚Äôs great fun and fills my social interaction itch while being stuck at home.

Many people say that ‚Äúpeople need to work in order to have purpose and direction in their life‚Äù to which I say BS.  I‚Äôve experienced a lot in my life so far.  I was raised overseas,  I‚Äôve traveled to over 20 countries in 5 continents, am an eagle scout, have been to war, have been in leadership roles my entire professional career.  At this point, living a boring, relaxing life is just what I want and need.  I‚Äôm not ambitious, I don‚Äôt want to be a CEO, hold political office or live like a celebrity.  I just want to live a relaxing life and enjoy my hobbies.  That may change some day, and if it does, then I‚Äôll make adjustments in my life.  But right now I‚Äôm living a life I very much enjoy and have no reason to change it.

&#x200B;

**Future plans:**

Here are some things I'm interested in accomplishing in the next year or so.

Travel - as I mentioned above, once the pandemic is over (second half of next year seems to the general estimate from experts) I plan on visiting a number of conventions/conferences/locations that I‚Äôve been interested in but never got around to seeing while I was working.  The good thing is that I can also take advantage of the off-peak traveling season for lower prices/less crowds for any places I want to sight see.

Getting a dog - I love dogs, but never got one before because of how often I was either out of the country or away from home for extended periods of time.  Especially since I am single I didn‚Äôt want to end up ditching it somewhere whenever I was gone.  I held off on making any serious commitments during my 1st year post-FIRE just in case I changed my mind but most likely I‚Äôll start looking for a dog to adopt early next year, there are a couple animal shelters near me that I‚Äôve already stopped by to check out.

More time with family - Again, something that has been derailed because of the pandemic.  Due to being in the military I did not get a chance to spend much time with my parents (especially when overseas).  I only saw them 1-2 times a year for a good chunk of my career.  We are quite used to it given that my family has moved pretty frequently all my life (we were ex-pats living overseas when I was growing up) but I had hoped to be able to visit them more often now that I have so much free time.  Unfortunately that‚Äôs not been possible given the current citation as I don‚Äôt want to risk possibly infecting them.  But we do talk much more frequently than in the past.

Becoming more handy with home improvement/repair - I‚Äôve been learning basic home improvement skills (As have many people who are stuck at home during this time, lowes is always packed).  I‚Äôve learned to take apart and clean a window AC unit, caulk a bathtub, hang curtains etc.  I‚Äôll leave the more complicated stuff like plumbing and electrical to the experts, but it‚Äôs nice being able to take care of minor stuff myself.

Boosting my emergency fund - I currently have about 7 months of spending in my savings account, I intend to increase this to 12 months of spending over the course of the next several months.  The economy is wack right now and it would not surprise me at all if we have a full blown recession and market crash in the near future, so while the market is strong I‚Äôm going to boost my emergency fund.  After that I‚Äôll probably stop withdrawing my dividends from my investments in cash and just let them reinvest back into themselves, I think I can live quite easily on the income I get from my military disability and rent while leaving my investments to grow.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

So, to conclude this very long post.  It‚Äôs been a crazy year, I‚Äôve experienced a lot of things I‚Äôve not done before, but overall, I‚Äôm very happy with my current lifestyle and have no desire to change it anytime soon.

There was a time when I liked doing it, being good at it, and being paid well for it. But now I feel unmotivated, lethargic. I feel like what I do now is so inconsequential to the world - I wanted to do something with more meaning. I have cycles of feeling neutral then negative at work. Recently, I've been at a low point, which is forcing me to think about what I want and what I should do.

But I kept going on because it paid well and every day slogging through inched me closer to FIRE. 

I've realized this a year or so ago now, and my action was to start a Master's degree at a field I think I would like, and it's being going well so far. I love learning this new field, and I feel like I could make real change happen if I get good with it. It's been a long time since I felt genuine excitement and curiosity and the want to learn and push through with it.

I was thinking, what if I just funded myself, lived on my savings, while I move forward in my degree and dive myself fully into the new field? The risks are that I might not be employable for an unknown amount of time which would have adverse effects on my timeline to FIRE. Being stuck in this dilemma has made me more miserable wasting away my days at a job I hate. 

It's not even my workplace. They're amazing and supportive. My manager is understanding, everyone's working for a great cause. It's just what I do specifically that I no longer get satisfaction from. Which is making the decision harder - why waste a good job with good people and good benefits?

The light on my head lit when I told myself this sentence: **Is FIRE worth delaying for n years if the change I'm attempting could make that journey less miserable?**

What was the point of me trying to free myself from work in the future, if in order to achieve that, I have to enslave myself right now? I am clearly unhappy, and have been for a long time.

I think it's time I make the jump. I'm going to be quitting to focus on my studies and prepare myself for my career pivot ahead. I'm lucky enough to have savings to give me the freedom to be able to do this, so I will.

I think what I want to try and say is, we all are invested in the FIRE mindset because we want to free ourselves from decisions that we only make because we need to earn the money to eat, live, survive. While FIRE is the penultimate goal, please check in with yourself and ask if you are happy now. Maybe there is a way your money now can give you the freedom you're earning for yourself in the future, now, albeit in a lesser, temporary form.",263.0,financialindependence

I found it interesting that inflation adjusted, $100/month then is \~ $18,000 year now - mighty close to 401k limits. Also, it uses a 6% return as an example. In their case, they talk about using bonds but that's pretty much the same rate people target today in a balanced portfolio.

Plugging in to inflation and compound interest calculators, they're talking about the modern day equivalent of getting to $440,000 in 15 years, or \~ $17,000/yr at 4% rule. Within striking distance of leanFIRE!

One of my parents was recently hiring and someone came in with a two year gap on their resume. During the interview, he explained that he had taken a temporary early retirement since he could. Neither of my parents had ever heard of this and both thought it was ridiculous when we talked about it at dinner. I introduced them to the ideas of the FI movement since it seemed pretty obvious to me that this guy was a part of it. They‚Äôve been asking me a lot about FI ever since which is pretty cool. That said, they were also worried he might just decide to walk out one day as well.

People here regularly talk  about others not understanding FI when discussing budgets, lifestyle, etc. but I haven‚Äôt send much on coming back to work after an early retirement. Many hiring managers don‚Äôt know about FI. My parents immediately assumed it was a lie to cover up for the inability to get a job (he could have been lying too, who knows). Just keep in mind that an early retirement may hinder getting another job when going back into the workforce.

124,The fallacy of buying stocks on the way down,,1178.0,kgxe9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kgxe9x/the_fallacy_of_buying_stocks_on_the_way_down/,1608483142.0,"In yesterday's [thread about timing the market](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kg7mym/i_graphed_out_all_the_guesses_from_the_contest_to/) there were a lot of people who talked about buying stocks on the way down, either towards the end of the drop or throughout the drop. 

This leaves out one important thing: They *had* money to put into the market on the way down. If so, that also means they didn't have that money in the market *on the way up*.

Once you have your allocation set (e.g. 80% stocks / 10% bonds / 10% cash), you should stick to that allocation. Sacrificing your cash position (or worse, your emergency fund) to buy more stocks could work out well, but it could be a disaster too. And if you had extra cash just sitting around that was available to buy stocks, then you almost certainly missed the chance to use that cash in the run-up before the drop.

Don't time the market. Choose your allocation and stick to it. Dollar Cost Averaging is fine, but that should be an automatic process that is independent of what the market is doing.",297.0,financialindependence
125,The 7 Rules of Money,,1150.0,f169o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f169o2/the_7_rules_of_money/,1581239150.0,"**1 - Fools and their money are soon parted:**

In the digital landscape, you will see many people selling courses. To put it bluntly, the three so called evergreen niches are generally: 'how to get rich quick', 'how to attract a supermodel partner using THIS specific pick up routine', and 'how to get a six pack in six weeks'.

This is a simplification but is not far off the mark.

Of course, there are some experts in certain fields providing specific and high quality information at a reasonable price - but this is the exception rather than the rule.

Possibly the most lucrative evergreen niche is ""How to Get Rich Quick"" and by the way this is not a new phenomenon - it has been going on for many years before the Internet.

However, the scale provided by the Internet means that it is more lucrative today than ever.

For example, if you are selling a $1000 course, you need to sell 1000 courses to generate a revenue of $1MM. You have to give a chunk to Uncle Sam, or you can set up shop in a more tax friendly nation if you are not an American citizen.

Using ad campaigns on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube and getting it out to millions of people, you can see why some have raked in the cash by selling thousands of these courses.

So remember that just like the Wild West, there are many scammers who want to part you from your money. If it sounds too good to be true, it is.

**2 - Understand what money is:**

Money of course has specific characteristics, but to simplify money is just the mechanism by which we transfer time and wealth. Provide value at scale by applying leverage (code, people, capital) and you will become rich.

**3 - Money can't buy happiness:**

Having enough money to be financially independent and avoiding financial stress *is* important though - studies have actually shown that financial stress can temporarily lower IQ. Not good.

In terms of happiness, some prefer to view it using the lens of excitement = happy, and boredom = sadness. This is generally more practical, as doing things that you enjoy and are aligned with some sort of purpose leads to a greater level of fulfilment (or happiness).

**4 - Beware of the Diderot Effect:**

In the words of Warren Buffett:

""If you spend money on things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.""

Now, we can probably think back to numerous occasions where we've bought something, and cringe thinking about how unnecessary the purchase was, and more importantly what he true opportunity cost is if it had of been invested instead.

We of course live in a consumer driven culture, whereby material possessions are the Holy Grail of one's achievement in life. This is starting to shift with the emergence of trends such as minimalism and FIRE, but it is still prevalent in popular culture and advertising.

In terms of consumer goods, there is an interesting social phenomenon called the Diderot Effect.

It is named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot.

Diderot was the co-founder and writer of Encyclop√©die, one of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time.

Diderot lived in poverty for most of his life, but all that changed in 1765 Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot‚Äôs financial troubles and offered to buy his library from him for ¬£1000 GBP (which is the equivalent of around ¬£178K today).

Suddenly, at the age of 52, Diderot had money to spare.

He acquired a new scarlet robe. And that's when the spiral began...

He noticed this is beautiful robe was out of place when surrounded by the rest of his common possessions.

According to Diderot, there was ‚Äúno more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty‚Äù between his robe and the rest of his items.

He felt the urge to buy some new things to match the beauty of his robe. He replaced his old rug with a new one from Damascus. He decorated his home with beautiful sculptures and a better kitchen table. He bought a new mirror to place above the mantle and his ‚Äústraw chair was relegated to the antechamber by a leather chair.‚Äù

These reactive purchases have become known as the Diderot Effect.

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled.

This spiral of consumption is one of the reasons why many former Sports stars go broke after they retire. When they got their big break and signed their first contract, they had more money than they knew what to do with. Then, they buy a huge mansion with a colossal mortgage and numerous Super-cars. Their lifestyle expenses then inflate to obscene levels such that once they retire and lose their main income source, they go broke. They were rich, but they weren't wealthy.

**5 - Avoid the Lifestyle Inflation Trap:**

Speaking of lifestyle inflation, this applies to mere mortals and not the Sports stars we see on TV.

In his best seller The Four Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss, examines the concept of 'the New Rich'.

The essence is the following: ""Who is better off: the person on $40K per year but working 30 hours a week, living well within their means, investing aggressively and spending the rest of their time pursuing other passions, or the Investment Banker on $400K working 100 hours a week, sacrificing their long term health, and living a very expensive lifestyle."" Of course, this is a simplified example: the Investment Banker could of course come from a wealthy family and have an eight figure inheritance, there are exceptions - but generally lifestyle inflation is a trap and something to watch out for.

**6 - Money is not necessarily the root of all evil:**

It is possible to make a lot of money ethically - you don't *have* to turn into a super villain to obtain it (although it does help!). But if you view money as evil, it will probably elude you forever.

Money just exacerbates what type of person you naturally are.

If you a decent person without lots of money, at your core, you're still a decent person in the long term with lots of money. In the short term you may see some people change for worse, but over the long term you'll find they're fairly consistent.

If you are a...not so decent person without lots of money, you'll still be a not so decent person with lots of money.

Also, unless someone is a genuine psychopath, humans are generally not completely ""evil"" or ""good"" anyway - it is a complex and dynamic situation, where the very definitions of good and evil vary depending on culture and period in history.

So, don't view money as completely evil, otherwise it may prove elusive.

**7 - Remember the Goal is Wealth:**

Finally, something that the wealthiest individuals understand, is that money is emotionless. It doesn't care how hard you work, it doesn't care about the sacrifices you make to obtain it, it doesn't even care if you don't buy avocado toast, it has no emotion.

It is more about realising that the real goal is to acquiring assets and diversifying to create genuine wealth, and having sufficient cash flow to maintain whatever sort of lifestyle you prefer.

There are ups and downs, salary fluctuations, job loss, career rut, unexpected expenses, lifestyle changes, the possible marriage which means possible kids, and the everchanging spreadsheet where your assumptions can change monthly/yearly. 

I have been trying to tell myself lately that it is OKAY to not achieve FIRE. Not achieving FIRE by age 45 for 50 doesn't make you a failure. More than likely, you will have more money saved than most people and the financial pressure will be lightened. If the pandemic has taught me anything it is that a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck and even having a little bit of a nest egg has given me some peace of mind. I am grateful for that.

127,A different way to think about your FIRE number,,1134.0,hdvy9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hdvy9v/a_different_way_to_think_about_your_fire_number/,1592844661.0,"A topic I see come up regularly in this sub is about how a mindset shift can have a drastic change on behaviors and happiness. Related to that, I'd like to share how I think about my FIRE goal.

For a metaphor, I recently had to do a 24 hour drive. That's a long drive. I could break it up into 2 days, 3 day, or hell, I could muscle through it and drive for 24 hours straight. Most people wouldn't recommend the last option, but it does allow you to reach your goal the fastest. So what I did for my drive is establish ""checkpoints"". As I reached major cities, I did a sanity check to see if I'm alert enough to continue driving.

I'm trying to take the same approach with my FIRE goal. While the end goal to my drive was reaching the destination, the goal with FIRE is to be financially independent. The journey to FI can look very different - it appears that everyone is trying to plan ahead exactly what that journey looks like. My proposal is to play it by ear. I have NW ""checkpoints"" where my goal is to re-evaluate my path at each turn.

\-When I reach $500k NW, I could consider a less stressful job where I don't continue to save as much, but elect to have a longer career. Maybe barista FIRE is right for me at this point. Or I can keep pushing along at full speed.

\-If I continue along at full speed, I'll keep going the course until I reach $1MM. At this point, could I lean/barista FIRE? Could I reduce my workload? Maybe start investing more heavily in real estate and become a full time landlord? Or have things gotten better in my current environment to where I'm okay with continuing on my drive?

&#x200B;

This doesn't change anything fundamentally outside of your mindset. Doing this way allows you to stop fixating on how many years of grinding your job remains, because there is no set number of years anymore. That fixation can be unhealthy and make you hate your job even more.  Just keep driving down the highway - when you're capable of taking a pit stop, you can decide then if you need to take a piss or nap.

If you asked me what my FIRE number is, the honest answer is ""I don't know."" But that doesn't mean I'm not properly forecasting or preparing for my future. I just find it less stressful to not get fixated on a specific end goal. We're in the middle of a long journey, stop kicking my seat and asking me ""are we there yet?""

&#x200B;

Edit: I highly recommend reading through the comments. Some people bring up great points to add to this discussion. Some people asked great questions to which I expanded my thoughts on a little. The most important thing that came up is that your checkpoints don't need to be based on net worth. They should be milestones that are meaningful to your financial future - new promotion, burnt out from work, family member gets ill, have a child, etc. The important aspect is that you don't treat FIRE as a straight line, obsession doesn't get you there any faster.

**THE JOURNEY TO FIRE**

[Link to graph I can't figure out how to upload](http://imgur.com/a/HcsEMQt)

&#x200B;

* *2008 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $5,000. NET WORTH: -$20,000.* Let‚Äôs start from rock bottom. I taught traditional art classes and worked odd jobs for less than minimum wage. Luckily my parents paid for most of my education.
* *2009 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $6,000. NET WORTH: -$19,000.* My first internship! I was pumped even though it was drudge work the full time folks didn't want to do.
* *2010 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $8,000. NET WORTH: -$17,000.* I freelanced and it crushed my soul. I made two dollars an hour for mostly terrible clients. One called at 2am to yell at me and I wasn‚Äôt sorry when his company shut down.
* *2011 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $12,000. NET WORTH: -$14,000.* My first real art job! Sadly only for the summer. I also freelanced but couldn‚Äôt line up any jobs for the next year. I realized I hated depending on art for money.
* *2012 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $31,000. NET WORTH: -$1,000.* After hundreds of applications to ‚Äúcreative‚Äù jobs, a tech startup hired me (my only job offer). Flush with cash, I treated my family to dinner, bought some fancy art books, and paid off most of my student loans. Then I got laid off.
* *2013 ‚Äî¬†EARNINGS: $62,000. NET WORTH: $20,000.* After intense hustling, I landed a job via my old manager visiting an agency that referred me to a startup (so bizarre). My dad told me to save in my 401k so I maxed it out and continued to do so every year.
* *2014 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $88,000. NET WORTH: $65,000.* I worked like crazy and got a raise and a bonus! I saved all my money in the bank until a friend told me about investing. Work felt tedious so I applied to grad school for art.
* *2015 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $93,000. NET WORTH: $115,000.* I rejected art school to work in consulting. The work was impactful and creative but also toxic and demanding. After my first vacation I didn‚Äôt want to go back. I learned about FIRE through wistful googling.
* *2016 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $95,000. NET WORTH: $175,000.* I read about investing and realized I was doing it wrong. I maxed out my IRA and HSA, and made my portfolio all index funds. Work got worse: 70+ hour weeks and a manager who made me feel like the worst creative on the planet.
* *2017 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $230,000. NET WORTH: $604,000.* I got married and we combined finances! They had \~$200k savings + $100k salary. I successfully negotiated for a job that paid $150k.
* *2018 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $262,000. NET WORTH: $667,000.* My new manager rocked and I never worked more than 40 hours a week. Unfortunately the year ended with a bad health event that rocked me.
* *2019 ‚Äî EARNINGS: $282,000. NET WORTH: $1,055,000.* I accepted an offer from a huge tech company for a stupidly high salary of $250k. It took 8 months of interviewing and negotiation.
* *2020 ‚Äî EXPECTED EARNINGS: $420,000. CURRENT NET WORTH: $1,203,000.* We had a baby! It's been immensely satisfying seeing my child grow every day. I was shocked find out my stocks at an old employer become worth a lot. I didn't count them in prior years. We'll make a disgusting amount of money this year. Counting my lucky stars.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**RANDOM REFLECTIONS**

I've been very lucky. I grew up as a poor immigrant and everything I have now feels so fancy. My relatives overseas are still farmers and use outhouses. They work hard for very little and their kids are their retirement. This would have been me if my parents didn't dare to dream bigger.

The skill that transferred over from art was getting joy from the creative process. Even in the most terrible of jobs the hours would fly by when I had an interesting challenge to focus on. I‚Äôm really looking forward to creating non-digital things and learning how to use my hands again.

If I could tell my younger self anything it would be: don't let your job define you. I thought I failed as an artist, I beat myself up for not succeeding in consulting. No! My job is a tool to get to where I want to be. I see colleagues and friends stressing out and bending over backwards to be better employees, and I am thankful I don't need to do this.

Throughout my career I invested in myself. I developed niche skills in a huge growing market. I asked for payment in classes and education when salary was low. The setbacks I thought were terrible at the time helped me get ahead. If I wasn't so bad at making money as an artist, I wouldn't have gone into tech. The consulting job that burned me pushed me to discover FIRE (ba-dum ching).

Overall, our budget has held steady at \~$45k with inflation over the past few years even with luxuries like eating out when we feel like and traveling around the world. FIRE mentality has helped me zero in on what I value the most. When I think about dollars buying freedom, suddenly all the stuff and experiences others want me to buy feel like a burden and distraction.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**GOING FORWARD**

I plan to work another year to reduce sequence of return risk. If things hold steady I should be at 3.25% withdrawal rate. My mom asked me why I don't work for even longer. Well at that amount of money I have a WAY higher chance of dying than my money running out. I can't buy more life with more money. You can't put a price on spending time with your kid, exploring a beautiful new city, eating a home cooked meal with loved ones.

I still work on art projects as a hobby (or at least I did before baby) and I want to do more once I quit my corporate job. They‚Äôve made a few thousand each year so I suppose that‚Äôs my insurance in case the market crashes or health costs blow up. More importantly, it's something that I love to do and adds joy to the world.

My rough plan:

* Optimize our last year of earning. Fill up the 401k, HSA, tIRA for me and my partner and get that sweet matching bonus + tax deduction.
* Enjoy big company benefits like massage chairs and free food. Get medical and dental things out of the way. Get TWO pairs of new glasses because I'm petty.
* Go on COBRA which buys me 1.5 years to figure out how to insure my family
* Maintain $45k annual expenses and cut during leaner years. It wouldn't be too hard to get down to \~$37k if we stopped traveling internationally and cooked more.
* For withdrawal, set dividends to not reinvest. Take the rest of expenses from the taxable funds on quarterly basis
* Convert company stocks to index funds and convert 401k -> traditional IRA and build a Roth Ladder. Do this as fast as possible without incurring taxes.
* Make a YOLO purchase of a fancy professional camera, the kind I dreamed about owning as an art student. Secondhand of course, I'm not fatFIRE  :P

We'll likely move out of our VHCOL area, hang with parents for a bit, then... travel around the world, build our own house, start a company? We don't know yet. It's a lot harder figuring out what to do with your life than what to do with your money. At least there are somewhat objective answers for the second.

131,The 401k early withdrawal penalty is really not that bad,,1108.0,k78klb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k78klb/the_401k_early_withdrawal_penalty_is_really_not/,1607179176.0,"I often hear of those not wanting to contribute much to their 401k due it being ""locked away until 59.5."" However in my view, the penalty does not make the 401k an untouchable lockbox. All it is is a fee, not some illegal or super complicated thing.


In fact, if you were to FIRE, you could very well come out ahead by putting money into your 401k and then eating the fee vs investing in taxable brokerages. The combination of tax deferment, compounding growth, and effective tax rates could work in your favor.

**Quick and Dirty Math:**

Alice and Bob both plan to FIRE and each needs $40,000 per year to sustain their lifestyle. Alice has $25,000 gross income per year to invest and contributes it to her taxable brokerage account. Bob will take the same $25,000 gross income and invest it between his pre-tax 401k and traditional IRA. We will assume both Alice and Bob are in the 24% federal tax bracket, making about $100k/yr as single filers, and that they receive a 5% annual return. 

Using the 4% rule, Alice's FIRE target is 25x40,000 = **$1,000,000**. She does not meet the threshold to pay any capital gains taxes on withdrawal.

Bob has to adjust his FIRE target since he knows he will be paying the early withdrawal penalty (10%) plus the effective tax rate on his annual withdrawals. His FIRE target is **$1,225,825**, based on 25x ($40,000 + 10% Penalty + Federal Effective Tax Rate of ~8.4%)

|Year|Alice's Year-End Amount|Bob's Year-End Amount|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$19,000|$25,000|
|2|$38,950|$51,250|
|3|$59,898|$78,812|
|4|$81,892|$107,753|
|5|$104,986|$138,140|
|..|..|..|
|25|$906,814|$1,193,177|
|26|$971,115|**$1,277,836**|
|27|**$1,038,713**|$1,366,728|

**Summary:**
Due to the upfront tax burden at a top marginal rate of 24%, Alice can only contribute $19,000 out of the $25,000 she allocates to invest per year. She reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 27.

Bob reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 26, about a year ahead of Alice, despite having a higher target. He gets there first because:

 - He can shovel significantly more money into his investments each year
 - Compounding is working harder in his favor 
 - His effective tax rate in retirement (~8.4%) is lower than the marginal tax rate (24%) he would have paid while working

**Other Thoughts:**

 - If Bob had received an employer match, he would have gotten there even sooner
 - Bob isn't going to pay the penalty forever. At some point he will reach 59.5, stop paying it, and his nest egg will remain larger than Alice's.
 - Alice is going to have a tax drag during her working years due to dividend income, so realistically she'd perform worse (thanks to lurker_cx for making this point)
 - If Alice and Bob made between between $60k/yr and $80k/yr and were in the 22% tax bracket, Bob would have still gotten there sooner but by a smaller margin
 - If they were each married filing jointly, their marginal tax bracket goes down to 22% and Bob's effective tax rate in retirement falls to ~4-5%. He still gets there sooner.
 - It doesn't matter whether you plummet the rate of return to 0% or ratchet it up to 20%, Bob reaches his goal sooner.

**Conclusion:**
The early withdrawal penalty will not kill you. While this is a simplified scenario and your situation may vary, it's very possible you can eat the penalty and *still come out ahead* of investing outside retirement accounts. Of course there are caveats (don't eat the penalty too early) and **there are better paths than doing what Bob did** - diversifying your tax buckets, Roth conversion ladder, etc - but he committed what is often seen as a financial sin and still comes out just fine.",354.0,financialindependence

It's been 20 years of often working 50+ hours, working on growing my career, playing defense with the personal finances and then offence with the investments.  I'll try to write up my path for some future Milestone Monday, but for today, it's just a stake in the ground.

I can't tell many people in my life so I wanted to do a little celebration post.

I'm a 26 year old chemical engineer in the midwest.  I started working full-time in 2015, with about $25k in student loan debt.  I've been saving aggressively since I found MMM and this sub a couple years ago.  It has definitely changed my life for the better.  Most importantly, it's helped me deal with the desire to live at or beyond my means and instead focus my effort on being the person I want to be.  I feel a lot more free nowadays.

If there's anything in particular that you'd like to know about my road here, let me know!

Edit:  Alright, here are some more details about how I got here.

I've been working basically since I could get a job at 16 years old.  I started off making minimum wage in food service, absolutely hating it.  I knew I couldn't do that for the rest of my life like some of my coworkers.  In high school, I studied harder than I needed to.  I was obsessed with getting good grades and not disappointing my family.  I did enjoy some subjects like math and science though (hence the chemical engineering route).  I ended up taking the ACT and SAT and getting near perfects on both, which was exciting at the time.  It felt like a ton of doors were opening for me.  

I ended up applying to a bunch of Ivy League schools and getting rejected by all of them (best thing that could have happened probably, but it didn't seem like it at the time lol).  I ended up going to school in the midwest, meeting a bunch of lifelong friends, and learning a shit ton in my small, interactive classes with great professors.  I still studied too much and didn't have enough fun in retrospect, but I guess it set me up to be successful so I shouldn't be too hard on myself.  I ended up leaving with a bachelors degree, $25k in loans, and a dream.

I applied to 41 jobs before getting a call back for an interview.  This interview went really well, and I ultimately accepted the offer.  My starting base salary was $55k.  For the next few years, I traveled and worked a lot.  60-80 hour weeks weren't uncommon back then -- lately, I'm down to 40-45 as I get more efficient and have a more manageable workload.  Anyway, I ended up paying off my loans in about a year.  Then I started investing harder and saving up for a new car.  I bought my dream car, a challenger, when I could pay cash.   I have rented apartments/houses this whole time. 

As far as investments go, I have roughly 90% in index funds, 5% in short term bonds (might be buying a house soon), and 5% in a taxable account that I trade options in for fun.  The option trading stuff isn't to try to beat the market necessarily, it's just to stay engaged and for a bit of excitement because passive investing alone wasn't doing it for me.  I don't YOLO wsb style, I recently have only been running the wheel strategy on stocks I'd like to buy anyway.

I don't budget in the traditional sense.  Everything is set up to ACH from checking to my taxable account and Roth IRA.  401k and HSA contributions are also automatic through work.  I believe automating your saving is the most important step of all to be successful.  I shamelessly can spend any money that's left over in my checking account (I also have an emergency fund, of course) because I'm *automatically* saving over half of what I make.  Target savings rate lately is about 60% of gross.   

The more I accumulate, the less I stress about most things in life.  I think it's made me significantly better at my job, relationships, and other aspects of life too.  If I missed anything important, let me know and I'll add it.  Thanks for the positive responses to this post!",301.0,financialindependence

Financially, I would consider myself both fortunate and comfortable. My wife and I are both established in our careers, and combine for a gross income of $250K-ish Canadian. We have 3 lovely children, though we‚Äôre ‚Äúold parents‚Äù for having them in our mid to late 30‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm sure 60 or 70 year old me will be thankful, but I feel like I‚Äôm sacrificing the middle third of my life for a future that is not guaranteed. Friends in similar positions are enjoying new(er) and large(r) homes, vehicles, family vacations (pre-COVID), etc., while I‚Äôm living in a 1000sqft bungalow built in 1956 and drive vehicles 10-15 years old. My wife and I had to accomplish everything ‚Äúthe hard way‚Äù and had little to no financial assistance from our parents. They just didn‚Äôt have to ability to help in that capacity. Many of our friends were able to live at home during university, paid very little tuition on their own, received assistance on home down payments, purchased their first home before the housing boom, made a small fortune selling their first home and are now on their second... gah! My wife and I lived on our own and paid our own way through university, bought our home at the housing market peak, and on and on.

Quite frankly, I‚Äôm unhappy with my daily life, and the promise of a comfortable retirement is not compensating for my growing resentment. It‚Äôs because all our income not dedicated towards living expenses (mortgage, utilities, food, childcare, etc.) is being saved an invested. Though we both have retirement plans through work, we have secondary RSP‚Äôs through our financial planner. RESP‚Äôs are in place for our 3 children. After allowing ourselves a minimal monthly ‚Äúallowance‚Äù everything else is put in to savings. Our net worth (assets vs liabilities) is already over the million dollar mark, our mortgage will be paid off in less than 5 years, vehicles were bought with cash, and we have no other debts.

And I fucking hate it. It‚Äôs a bizarre feeling, because I should feel comfortable and content, but I feel trapped and limited.

Here are some decisions I‚Äôm making as a \~30 year old pursuing FI with an aggressive risk tolerance. I think of all of the items below as more productive financial planning moves than agonizing over falling account balances. Obviously your situation is your own, but I'm posting them here for feedback and anyone looking for a sanity check.

**1 - Increasing 401(k) contributions:** I am tightening other areas of the budget to direct more money into my 401(k) due to the recent dip. I expect that 30 years from now when I can use this money I won‚Äôt regret it.

**2 - Continuing scheduled investments:** My wife has a Roth IRA invested in 80% stocks and 20% bonds. we have a home purchase goal for next year invested in 100% bonds. Continuing to fund these regularly as we have.

**3 - Rebalancing accounts:** This is happening automatically, so I‚Äôm not actually lifting a finger. But my accounts are being rebalanced which is effectively selling bonds and buying stocks because most of my accounts have drifted from their 80% stock, 20% bond allocation.

**4 - Trying (and mostly failing) to stop watching daily market swings:** It doesn‚Äôt serve me at all to watch this stuff so I‚Äôm trying to pay less attention to sensationalist headlines on things I can‚Äôt control.

**5 - Keeping my home purchase and emergency fund goals conservatively invested:** In tempted to dump these in stocks but recognizing the power of goals based investing. These portfolios have held up well in the volatility, so I‚Äôm going to let them keep doing their boring thing.

**What I'm not doing.** As you filter your decisions, think about what I‚Äôve decided not to do as the opposite of the decisions above. Those choices would be:

* Stop contributing a 401(k) or withdraw money. Not happening.
* Cancel scheduled investments. Don‚Äôt get spooked, hamburgers are on sale.
* Let accounts drift. Not rebalancing means you end up with style drift.
* Staying glued to the ticker tape. It‚Äôs a cruel rollercoaster.
* Putting my emergency fund or home purchase money into stocks to ‚Äúbuy the dip.‚Äù That‚Äôs short term money and I don‚Äôt want to put it at risk.

**4 steps I would take if I could:** These are things I would consider doing but they don't apply because I've already done them (option 1), I don't have the ability to (option 2/3) or don't need to (option 4).

1. **Convert traditional IRAs to Roth.** It could be a solid time for a Roth conversion, paying taxes on money held in a traditional IRA now to never pay taxes on it again. If you have one this could be a good reason because 1) you won‚Äôt pay taxes on this transaction for 13 months, 2) it‚Äôs likely your account value dropped, 3) there may be additional tax relief next year depending on stimulus measures.
2. **Tax-loss harvest.** I don‚Äôt have many opportunities to do this with my portfolio primarily in retirement accounts. But this can be a powerful choice if you suddenly find yourself with losses.
3. **Dollar cost average in a large cash position.** I don‚Äôt have much dry powder, but if I did now is a time I would be aggressively averaging into stock indexes over the next few months as this plays out.
4. **Switch investment managers.** Not happy with your investment manager? It may be less expensive to switch to new management if you now have less in taxes to worry about. It‚Äôs important to leave for the right reasons, ‚ÄúI lost money‚Äù is probably not a good one because that‚Äôs the same story every long-term investor is dealing with right now.

I imagine you've heard what I'm about to say, but hopefully it'll encourage you to hear that these coping mechanisms aren't just theoretical, but are actually effective. They're working for me right this very second.

**STOP ENDLESSLY BROWSING REDDIT AND OTHER FORMS OF ANONYMOUS SOCIAL MEDIA.** This is huge. For human interaction switch largely over to what let's call intentional conversation. Communicate with friends and family and acquaintances directly by phone or IM or whatever best suits you instead of getting lost in a crowd of strangers. Target your support. This brings out the best in people.

**Stick to hard news and stay away from sensationalized coverage.** Despite what I just said about Reddit, /r/covid19 is a great central source for hard science. The science is encouraging, and it's great to see how the global scientific community is coming together.

**Find stories about everyday heroes, like the teacher who's right now leading my daughter's virtual classroom.** In 2009 we were all uplifted when Captain Sully safely landed that American Airlines flight in the Hudson River. Stories like that were what we needed to hear. Honest to God, I'm pretty much worshiping the linoleum my pharmacist walks on.

**Futurology doesn't have to be negative.** Like: the distributed manufacturing systems springing up are gonna be huge in the post-COVID-19 world. I seriously wish I owned a 3D printer right now. This event could also blow a lot of bullshit out of our healthcare and college systems. Etc., etc.

**Keep exercising.** No need to belabor this. Yoga and burpees if nothing else.

**Establish a routine.** Old convicts frequently tell new ones how important it is to structure their day instead of sitting around playing cards and doing constructive things only when they feel like it. This is good advice for anybody. Keeps one busy instead of sitting around mooning about stuff or smoking weed all day or spanking the monkey fourteen times an hour. It takes some self-discipline, but it's totally worth it. Incorporate an educational component. ""I like birds, so today I'm gonna replace a half-hour of Netflix with a half-hour ornithology lecture.""

**Remember that as a FIREee or an aspiring one, you're already ahead of the game because you have some money put by.** Our community's gonna hear a lot of ""Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were, eh?"" Whatever. We were at least smart enough to make money and keep it and put it to work for us. A direct reason I was able to FIRE is that my grandparents survived the Great Depression and passed what they learned to my parents and to me. This is a hell of an opportunity for us to be ambassadors for sound personal financial management.

**Figure out ways to spend locally.** There are gonna be a lot of cottage industries springing up. My wife and I have more or less pledged to each other that if it should work out that we get stimulus checks, we're gonna spend them on our friends who are trying to earn money. Like: my friend forages for wild mushrooms and such for selling to restaurants. That market has dried up. We just started buying watercress from him. Everybody wins.

**Check out live-streaming performances.** Did you catch the Dropkick Murphys live show last week? I was like, damn, this is exactly the breath of encouragement and normalcy I needed. /r/festivals is doing some great work curating this stuff. My wife's over here watching a video Steve Martin just posted. He's out in the woods somewhere playing the banjo. It's awesome.

I guess that's it for the moment. Last thing I'll say is that while I don't know you personally, I care about you and I want you to feel healthy and happy. Stay strong and be well.

I am 31F working in tech(non-engineer). I am really proud of myself for taking the time to gain invaluable knowledge to grow my net worth to what it is today. I have been able to more than double my net worth in the last 2.5 years, with the help of this sub. 


https://imgur.com/wlrfIxP


In 2019, my total income was over $200k, which I was stunned at, but really shows the power a growth company (non-FAANG) can have on your NW. I have worked for a tech company for 5+ years in a VHCOL city and didn‚Äôt always sell my RSUs/ESPP, against conventional wisdom, but it paid off for me last year when the stock took off and was up over 100% YoY at some point. I took advantage of that and sold a lot (but not all) of my stock.


My NW was down about 50-60k during the March 2020 selloff but has more than recovered since then. I have more than recovered from that low, up about 92k from the low. I stuck with the advice that I‚Äôve read on here and didn‚Äôt panic sell. I kept my investment allocation to what I was comfortable with(70% stocks/ 30% bonds/cash) and it rode it out. I believe that having some cash available in retirement accounts is good for when the market sells off. I know it‚Äôs not the advice always given here but I believe it works for me. I try to keep about 10% minimum of cash in my retirement accounts just in case.


I max out my 401k(19.5k+4.5k match). I stopped contributing to my IRA/Roth IRA a few years ago once I hit the income caps. I currently have about $170k among my 401k/Roth IRA/IRA accounts. I am hesitant to do the mega back-door Roth because I‚Äôd have to pay tax on the amount I have in the traditional IRA(~15k) and I feel like my tax rate is high as it is. I know it‚Äôs a one time hit but I am saving money for a condo/house instead. I am not in a rush to buy a condo/house right now but continue to save up for one in the near-term(1-3 years probably) which is why I have a lot of cash on hand($100k+). I know it could be invested but in this environment I am too nervous at the potential of losing some of my savings. I also don‚Äôt know if I am ready to be a homeowner as the thought stresses me out. I think there are so many things that could go wrong(like repairs) and I don‚Äôt know how to really fix anything. Right now, I like the convenience of renting but I know I am not building equity.


I also sometimes wonder whether I am saving too much for retirement but I continue to max out my 401k because I believe it‚Äôs the prudent thing to do. I am targeting $2.2-2.4M for retirement with a 4% withdrawal rate. It‚Äôs hard for me to estimate my retirement expenses so I think ~$85k/year should be sufficient for now but I don‚Äôt know. This is not factoring in any income from a potential partner either.


I have no student loans, my car has been paid off for a couple of years now, and I pay my cc bills in full each month. This gives me flexibility, security, and financial freedom. Arguably, my rent is high (~2900/month) but most of the other spending is discretionary and during quarantine my expenses have come down and my biggest expense is probably groceries and things from Target/Costco(~$300/month). I try not to eat out as much as possible and max spend $100/month but normally closer to $50).


For those of you who are new here or are unsure about getting on board with the advice you‚Äôve read here, I can attest to it and it‚Äôs really made a positive change to my life. I feel stable and secure financially, which I have learned is one of my most important values, which puts me at peace. I am thankful. Thank you.",262.0,financialindependence
145,Thoughts and decisions that led to debt free with paid off mortgage in early 30‚Äôs,,1039.0,gur5bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gur5bv/thoughts_and_decisions_that_led_to_debt_free_with/,1591039674.0,"My wife and I are early 30‚Äôs, have worked hard, caught good breaks, delayed gratification, and have paid off student loans and our mortgage. We are now debt free and own our home outright. 

I realized if you want something different than everyone around you, you will have to do things differently. This may lead to people calling you frugal, or saying you shouldn‚Äôt pay off your mortgage. 

Each choice I have made to attack debt or not take on new debt has led to the next, and once you pay off debt it impacts your decision making moving forward. You really don‚Äôt want to take on any more debt. It is too much work to pay it off to go through it again. 

I realized after graduation that paying off my student debt in 3 years instead of 15-30 will save $100k +. Lifetime earnings are finite. I turned down my ego, moved in with my parents, worked and worked overtime and put everything I made towards my student loans for 3 years. 

Sacrifice: living with parents for 3 years and driving a $3,500 car while most people in my cohort were living on their own and driving nicer cars

Luck: having parents willing to let me live with them.

I met my now wife, bought an inexpensive home. We continued to drive inexpensive cars and contributed to 401ks / HSAs. Extra money was put in stock for down payment for next house. 

$100k more or less on a new mortgage at ~3% does not change the monthly obligation drastically- it is so easy to take on a big mortgage with today‚Äôs rates. I realized the true game changer for us is not having a mortgage. We decided to use the money saved to payoff our current house instead of upgrading to one that would take us 15-20 years to pay off.  It is amazing how much money you pay in interest on a $300k-500k mortgage over a 15 or 20 year period, even with low interest rates. If you think that this is ‚Äúfree money‚Äù you probably have not met a banker. Banks are rich off this. 

I don‚Äôt necessarily want to retire early. I don‚Äôt want a second home. It just puts a huge smile on my face knowing that I am actively choosing to go to work every day and I have no debt / financial obligations. It is really a much more carefree existence, and exponentially more so than when I had ‚Äúmost‚Äù of my mortgage paid down. Being grateful for what you have every day and realizing that even owning a car is a luxury in this world is helpful in getting there and avoiding upgrade-itis. Marie Kondo is also helpful- sell the stuff you don‚Äôt use and need. Ask yourself- is this item you have or want something you want to take with you into the next part of your life?

Hope this inspires others to do the same, or whatever makes them happy

Edit: this forum cracks me up. I posted here because this forums definition of financial independence is ‚Äúnot having to work for money.‚Äù To me, this is different than debt optimization or leverage. If you have a huge mortgage and are choosing not to pay it off despite having significant investment income, the markets will dictate your level of FI at any given time. Are you wealthy? Maybe. Will your money earn more this way over your lifetime? Possibly, or even probably. Do you own your house? No, the bank does. Does a large market downturn mean you are walking around with your pants around your ankles, like a clown? If so, then no, you are not financially independent.",337.0,financialindependence
146,The ennui of wealth vs the power of obligations,,1025.0,hrq13b,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hrq13b/the_ennui_of_wealth_vs_the_power_of_obligations/,1594828212.0,"It‚Äôs common to the point of being a clich√© on these subreddits: the wealthy people complaining about their meaningless, purposeless, unfulfilling lives.

Financial Independence is at its heart about achieving an extreme level of freedom, where constraints are removed. The Obligation of the Mortgage: gone. The Obligation of the Workday: gone. The Obligation of Maintaining A Luxurious Standard Of Living To Impress Your Neighbors: gone. 

Many FI writers imply, or explicitly state, that these obligations should be replaced with your own personal desires after you RE. Some people default to Travel, because on the internet, everyone is supposed to like travel. Some people talk about volunteering in some abstract sense. Some people talk about hobbies. 

It‚Äôs easy to see how rich people who fill their lives with nothing after their working careers are miserable. It‚Äôs less easy to see, but still fairly visible to careful readers of /r/financialindependence, that filling your life with nice sounding, but basically self-centered wants (self-enrichment through travel, self-enrichment through volunteering) doesn‚Äôt do it for a large number of people on anything better than a superficial level. 

I think this is because of a fairly basic mistake in FI thinking. By removing the obligations of material scarcity in your life through savings and investment, you are not removing your obligations as a human being to the culture and society you live in. A financially independent person who wants to avoid a life of meaningless ennui needs to understand that what they do after they stop working needs to be ‚Äì in large part ‚Äì determined by your obligations to your fellow human beings. Not by what feels good in the moment.

I don‚Äôt mean you need to start a school to teach Financial Independence and the 4% rule to 8th graders. FI is, in many ways, a system hack that will never be available (or even the right choice) for everyone in a society structured like ours. And I‚Äôm not saying that need to fight for Full Communism or some overarching political ideology. You don't.

What I am saying is that, once you‚Äôve eliminated material scarcity from your life, a good fraction of your energy needs to go to helping other people in specific and material ways, and which is *not* determined by your desire for self-enrichment, but rather by you obligation to your fellow humans. 

Maybe this means teaching the working class neighbor kid who loves computers how to interact with APIs with python.

Maybe it means starting a business from the ground up built around employee ownership, and with a culture designed to prevent life working there from being a miserable slog to retirement.

Maybe it's a million other things.

But don‚Äôt do it to make yourself feel fulfilled. Do it because you‚Äôre obligated, as one of the lucky ones.

Tl;dr stop focusing on yourselves or you‚Äôll be fucking miserable. You‚Äôve got to pull other people up behind you.",318.0,financialindependence

One of them included a prohibition on over-the-counter medications without a prescription, which makes it a little harder to withdraw money from an HSA without penalty.

Well, thanks to a very minor technical change that's easy to miss on page 364 of the [COVID-19 stimulus bill,](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20200325223111/FINAL-FINAL-CARES-ACT.pdf) that's about to change.  See below:

148,FI gen-xer about to RE in 18 months | first post,,1017.0,i6lbc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i6lbc8/fi_genxer_about_to_re_in_18_months_first_post/,1596987385.0,"Greetings to my fellow FIRE enthusiasts, and welcome to my wall of text.

I am a long-time (11 years) redditor and have been very lightly engaged in this subreddit for much of that time. I‚Äôve created this alternate account specifically for personal Accountability, as well as a way to Interact with the reddit FIRE community. Here‚Äôs what I mean by that:

**Accountability**

* One key enabler of my ability to RE is a very early start to index fund investing, and a set-it-and-forget-it approach.
* Perhaps not surprisingly, I haven‚Äôt been very active in actually **planning** to FIRE, and I‚Äôve developed certain lazy behaviors in the intervening years. I could have been more aggressive with my current career. I should have been more thoughtful about real estate decisions. I could have done a better job communicating my specific FIRE goals to my wife (she‚Äôs now on board). Etc.
* So, I‚Äôm looking to drive more Accountability for myself in actually taking concrete steps to RE. And, there are some specific milestones that I‚Äôm setting for myself.
* Obviously, an anonymous account doesn‚Äôt drive Accountability terribly well, being anonymous and all. But I‚Äôm giving a go nonetheless. As many in this community know, communicating FIRE goals with your friends and family as a means to Accountability is fraught AF. I don‚Äôt care to blog. So I‚Äôm putting it all on you.

**Interaction**

* I personally find the Personal Journey content in this community to be the most engaging, though the technical and financial discussions are helpful as well.
* I suspect that most of my contributions will be of the ‚Äúhow it‚Äôs going/what it‚Äôs like/what I‚Äôve learned‚Äù sort, versus robust financial advice. But I‚Äôll share what advice I can. Think of the updates you see from[ u/FIRE\_and\_forget\_it](https://www.reddit.com/u/FIRE_and_forget_it)  and[ u/jasonlong1212](https://www.reddit.com/u/jasonlong1212) ‚Ä¶ that is what I envision.
* This also obviously runs the risk of being solipsistic and indulgent. So I apologize in advance and graciously accept your downvote.

With that Purpose out of the way, here‚Äôs some deets around yours truly:

**Quick Demographic info**

* I am a Gen-X American white male. Married with no children. All of our close relatives are self-sufficient. We are generally healthy (though with pre-existing conditions) and very in-shape for our age. We have a social network in the Goldilocks zone. Our community reflects our values.
* Right away, you can see the privilege. More on that below.
* I currently live in a large city in the Northern half of the US. I have lived in several different cities in my life, but spent the vast majority of my career in a single region of the US.

**My Educational Background and Career (the over-long section ‚Ä¶ tl;dr at the end)**

* **Public Schools.** The most consequential test I ever took was in 5th grade. I grew up in a public school system with several tracks of study at the Middle and High school level, the most advanced of which was called Gifted & Talented. The test I took alongside all of my peers in 5th grade happened to put me in the G&T track starting my first year of Middle school. I didn‚Äôt even know what the test was for at the time. It was easy sailing from there on out, literally through college, kicking off a virtuous cycle of achievement and positive reinforcement. This is surely an indictment of the US public school system.
* **State University.** I moved around a bit as a kid, which did not advantage me in terms of developing a record of extra-curricular achievement, reputation and rapport within any given school. Consequently, many of my friends I grew up with ‚Äúback home‚Äù ended up going to some really prestigious schools (the Ivies and the ilk), whereas I went to a large public University system in-state with a fair amount of scholarship support. This was a huge blessing in retrospect. It was an incredible bargain, and I graduated with zero debt.
* **First Job.** A year after graduation, and after a ‚Ä¶ light academic adventure, let‚Äôs say ‚Ä¶ I started applying for jobs. I had probably applied to 10 or so companies when I was asked to come in to interview at a local software company. The interview process was very rigorous, and I think describing it in detail may give away too much. Not FAANG though, (in fact, there was no FNG at the time, and barely a second A), and nowhere near FAANG-level compensation, at least initially. I was offered a job over the phone one Friday afternoon, and started work the following Monday AM. My starting salary was $31K. The job search lasted probably two months. I realize this sounds crazy nowadays.
* **Career Path.** My career trajectory from that point has been: software > MBA > consulting > corporate gig. That ‚Äúgig‚Äù term is carrying a lot of weight. On paper, each of these moves looks like a step-up in salary, but in reality each represents an unintentional down-shifting of earning growth. I can elaborate on that if there‚Äôs interest. I‚Äôve been working full time non-stop (except for the full-time MBA) for over 20 years now. I can elaborate on the value of a full time MBA if there‚Äôs interest.
* **Lucking Out.** As I look back on this education and career trajectory, I feel like I was getting through some really critical gates just before they got tougher to pass through. That G&T exam in 5th grade was barely a blip on anyone‚Äôs radar (I think), but now I suspect parents view it as a make-or-break moment for their child (if it exists anymore). AP courses were just becoming prevalent after I left high school, so that wasn‚Äôt a big stressor for me. My University was still easy-ish to get into (a two-page application without an essay, if I recall correctly). College tuition really didn‚Äôt explode until after I was out. The software company I joined was very particular in who we hired, but didn‚Äôt really didn‚Äôt draw large numbers of applicants until after I joined. I was oblivious to any career guidance and interviewing/application support at my university. It probably existed, but I view that as a reflection on how unserious we were about competing for jobs in the 90‚Äôs. Maybe it‚Äôs a Gen-X thing.
* **Modest Spending the past 20 years.** All along the way, my appetite for material things, and consequently large expenses, has remained relatively modest. There are vices here and there (eating out at nice restaurants, international travel, organic groceries, craft beer), but on balance, I have deliberately not cared much at all about the Joneses. Maybe it‚Äôs a Gen-X thing. Obviously, not having kids is probably the single-biggest variable here. So, I‚Äôve been able to sock away a fair bit, and invested it primarily in broad-based mutual funds. My grandpa opened an S&P500 index fund for me with probably about $500 when I was very young and barely able to understand the concept (maybe when I was 13). At age 23, without really thinking, I just started adding to that. Again, privileged. I would estimate my lifetime savings rate at over 50%, but I haven‚Äôt seriously calculated it.

I tell you all of this to emphasize that I didn‚Äôt blaze my own way to FI, not really. But there are still lessons to be had (more below).

**TL;DR**: heads-down student, unstrategic and overall lucky career trajectory, modest spending levels, DINK, all generating what you might call ‚Äúpassive-aggressive‚Äù saving.

**The Numbers**

* Our net worth is currently $2.4M, setting aside the value in RSUs that I would forfeit if I RE‚Äôd right now.
* The vast majority of this is in index funds, split between Taxable and Retirement accounts. I have about an equal split between Taxable and Retirement, though not due to any deliberate strategy, and is something I probably haven‚Äôt given enough thought to. I have about $100K in home equity and a bit in cash that makes up the balance of the net worth.
* My relatively small proportion of net worth in home equity reflects my own belief that I would be better off investing in the broader equities market versus local real estate market (i.e., my home). I may or may not have been correct in that belief, I truly don‚Äôt know.
* Very little of this originated as equity compensation until recently, even from my software days (which is a sad tale for another time).
* Our 10-year trend in non-healthcare spending is about $65K/year. A fair chunk of this year-in and year-out is Home Improvement, which is shocking and sad to me.
* Based on certain assumptions around income next year, tax rates in retirement, stock market valuations, RSU vesting, and healthcare premiums and other costs, if I were to RE at the beginning of 2022 (a year and a half from now), our WR would be 3.2%. This WR is about what we‚Äôre comfortable with. For context, a WR of 3.5% would allow for $75K in non-health spending, which we‚Äôve never exceeded in the past 10 years.

**How I Got Here/Advice if you‚Äôre interested**

(Thanks to[ u/CripzyChiken](https://www.reddit.com/u/CripzyChiken)  for ideas to make this post more helpful than it was about to be.)

Moving beyond my own biography, here are some things that I think enabled our ability to FIRE:

* **Appreciate the power of compounding interest**. As a former student of economics, I refuse to call it ‚Äúmagic.‚Äù But **saving early** has non-intuitive benefits. Debating between saving $15/month vs spending it on HBO? You won‚Äôt remember what you watched on HBO ten years from now, but you‚Äôll certainly enjoy knowing that extra $3K gets you much closer to retirement.
* **Think in terms of Opportunity Cost, constantly.** This is a concept I think most of us know, but which seems so overlooked when I see my friends‚Äô and family‚Äôs spending behaviors. The incremental expense you take on now isn‚Äôt just a trade-off at the moment of purchase, it‚Äôs something that has long-term consequences of what that cash could have provided you. Similar to the HBO example, I like[ MMM‚Äôs swimming pool example](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/07/25/the-twenty-dollar-swim/) even more. This has the unfortunate consequence of being debilitating (is anything truly worth it?), but is a good baseline attitude to have.
* **Understand your values with respect to material things.** As a household, we spend $65K/year. That‚Äôs not nothing. But we definitely under-index in spending relative to our peer group here. And we‚Äôre more than OK with that. In fact, we are looking to downsize and economize with our next home. Life is to be lived, sure, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to think about what things deliver happiness to you versus what social pressure would have you spend. I currently drive a Honda Civic that I bought in 2011. My previous car was a Honda Civic that I drove for 14 years.
* **The ROI on a graduate degree may be iffy**. I can elaborate in future posts, but my decision to get an MBA likely had a profoundly negative ROI. A graduate degree is by no means a ticket to a better financial outcome, and the opportunity cost you pay in taking time off of work should be measured not only in terms of the year or two you take off work, but also all of the foregone goodwill you would have otherwise created in your field. Happy to elaborate if there‚Äôs interest.
* **Deliberate career decisions with those you trust,** ideally with more experience than you. A story for another time, but my leaving the software company when I did was arguably the most consequential financial decision I ever made (and not in a good way). If I were to do it over, I would have consulted my dad and others 20+ years my elder for their view. (Correct, I did not run the idea past my dad - I have an independent streak.) I‚Äôm sure I would have been advised to wait it out a year or two. And, in my case, if I had followed that advice, I would definitely be retired by now, no question.
* **Understand that you have tax and healthcare burdens when you think about a SWR.** Too often I see people in this subreddit compare annual expenses to net worth, and believe that they‚Äôre golden when that ratio dips below 4%. You need to account for capital gains taxes (potentially at the state level too), as well as healthcare insurance premiums that you‚Äôd incrementally incur when estimating future expenses. In my case, I will need to draw down my investments by $95K/year to fund my non-healthcare spending of $65K/year, though I do live in a high tax State.

**Acknowledgements**

* The biggest contributor to my ability to FIRE is the profound privilege I experience as a white American male. It‚Äôs probably obvious from the above, but I have encountered very few material hurdles in my life.
* One one hand, I haven‚Äôt actually received an obscene amount of financial support from others after graduating high school. My parents helped to pay for some living expenses early on in college, through perhaps my Sophomore year, but tuition and later expenses were covered by my scholarships and through my part-time jobs. I stayed at their home for the two months-long job search, but moved out shortly after that. I covered the down payment on my first house (I think many Americans get support from their parents on this, though it doesn‚Äôt seem to be discussed much in polite company).
* On the other hand, I am by no means self-made. In fact, I feel the opposite. The non-financial investments my parents made in me were significant. And, I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of this country‚Äôs firehose of white privilege since birth. Since before birth, if you think about it. In a sense I have a different kind of debt that I believe I need to pay. More on that in post-FIRE posts, I hope.

**Why FIRE sooner versus later**

* **I do not draw meaning from my work**. I undoubtedly have an impact on the company, create shareholder value, etc. But my company‚Äôs mission is not something that fulfills me at a personal level.
* **I am a tired imposter.** While I fully acknowledge how easy I‚Äôve had it in the grand scheme of things, I have been working pretty damn hard for 20+ years. Early on, in software and consulting, the hours and effort and travel were insane. Insane! Nowadays, thankfully, it‚Äôs just a low-level burning grind, but it‚Äôs still taxing. I do somehow feel a cumulative mental wear-and-tear from work over the past 20+ years. I don't handle stress as well as I used to. I should be supremely in-control of the work and team by now, but I don‚Äôt feel I am. And I feel like an imposter oftentimes: my Millennial and Gen-Z colleagues (how‚Äôd THAT happen so fast?) are twice as bright and three times as productive as I ever remember being. Maybe I‚Äôm just getting old. Maybe it‚Äôs a Gen-X thing.
* **I owe.** Even though this is an anonymous account, I realize this will sound self-aggrandizing -- but this fucked-up year has really opened my mind to my privilege and I need to do something more. It‚Äôs time for me to get off the pot and create a domino of openings for others at the company who have had to work a lot harder than me to get where they are. This is a concrete and specific thing, and my company would almost certainly take it as an opportunity to increase diverse representation (my company is serious AF about this issue now). So, I intend to quit within two years, ideally at the beginning of 2022, depending on certain constraints.

The above are the immediate drivers, and may seem to violate the ‚Äúcreate the life you want and then save for it‚Äù credo of FIRE, but to me it does not. I have a very happy life outside of work, which I intend to maximize post-FIRE. My retirement will be overfilled with a backlog of interests groaning to expand. The above are just pushing me to an earlier vs later RE date.

**Next Steps for Me**

Why am I setting my RE date at the beginning of 2022 instead of right now? There are a few constraints I need to work through:

* Constraint 1: Healthcare coverage. While we are generally healthy, we have pre-existing conditions that I worry will impact our ability to secure coverage upon RE. The ACA is currently being challenged in the Supreme Court on severability grounds, and I believe it will be heard in October 2020.  A decision will likely come by June 2021, so that is an important milestone for me.
* Constraint 2: COVID and Mortgages. We would really like to move out of our current home to a smaller home in a different location in the metro area for the first many years of FIRE. I know that asset-based mortgages are a thing. But I would much prefer getting into a traditional mortgage, and then RE after that. We are choosing to wait until after the pandemic is resolved (however that happens) before we get out into the market, and show our home for sale. So, I don‚Äôt expect to put our current house on the market until late 2021 at the earliest.
* Constraint 3: RSUs. Some of my RSUs vest in early 2022, so would be worth waiting out even if RE were possible earlier than the above two constraints seem to allow. This is of course the goal of RSUs.

Immediate next steps I‚Äôm taking:

* Constraint 2: Make a plan around moving to a new home. This still involves a build-buy decision we need to make. I have a lot of research to do.
* Also: Build a relationship with community organizations in the coming months, so I have a plan for post-FIRE engagement in my community. I have plenty of interests that will divide my time, but none of them really contribute to the community meaningfully.
* Also: Stay employed until then. No small thing -- I know how close I am to RE, and my energy and motivation to exceed expectations at work is flagging. Stated differently: the senioritis is real. Granted, I will be fine if I were laid off tomorrow, and perhaps needn‚Äôt work full time again. But I‚Äôd much prefer to keep to my plan.

This post may not be particularly intriguing now, and may not generate much interaction. But consider this the first entry that I‚Äôm hoping you all can come back to as I journal my FIRE journey in the coming years.

In the meantime, what would you like to see in updates going forward? I will share what I can.

Finally, to the Millennial and Gen-Z redditors who aspire to FIRE: I am sorry for the fucked up world you are in. You will face many more challenges to save for retirement than I (and especially the Boomers) ever have, and you do not deserve that. I am in awe of your resilience (I see it all the time at work), and I am trying to do my part to make it better. Keep at it!

**TL;DR:** American guy wants you to read about his FIRE journey in the coming years as a means to his achieving personal accountability. This is a ‚Äúkick-off post‚Äù of little immediate interest, and likely worthy of your downvote, but may be something to read again later on in the journey to see how well he stuck to his goal. He also wants to know what you want to hear from him about.

**Edit:** I appreciate all of the early responses, I can feel the accountability growing -- yikes!  A quick note as a number of you have told me not to apologize for being white.  I think I understand where you are coming from, but I didn't intend this to seem like an apology per se.  I mean only to emphasize the reality in my own life that so much opportunity has come from this.  I understand the point some of you make that there are examples of privileged individuals from all races.  I would offer this way to think about it: Let's take the one example of the critical G&T test I took in 5th grade.  I was able to take that test because my parents moved into a plum public school district, which they were able to do because they were able to get a nice(ish) home, which they were able to do through rolling over the home equity from another city, where they were unencumbered by redlining because our family was white.  Now, multiply that by everyone I went to school with in that district (not every family had the same path, sure, but the systemic privilege exists).  It wasn't just me in that boat at school, and I can count on one hand how many Black friends I had at that school.  At any rate, I will likely not change any minds here, and while this is a deeply held belief of mine, I will probably delve little to not-at-all into this in future posts.

**Edit:**  I have updated the post to fix a violation of a posting rule.

**Edit:** Just to set expectations on the Interaction note, I will probably not post again on this topic until Spring 2021.  I've been advised that every 6 months to 1 year is about the sweet spot for update frequency.  Thanks for the engagement on this post.",251.0,financialindependence

Here are screenshots of the Mint Trends, which has every single expense from the past year categorized.  I've added comments on each page.

[**Expenses Overview**](https://i.imgur.com/qk7ZwDM.png)

[Auto Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/MMjwVUE.png)

[Food Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/wk7TgOm.png)

[Home Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/MLAOnxS.png)

[Utility Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/qslLk4f.png)

[Tax Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/AdkWVZk.png)

[Healthcare Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/upxiRUs.png)

[Entertainment Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/bKd5Ycb.png)

Main takeaways, my total expenses for the year was $37,700, but I'm going to dismiss about $15,000 of that as ""one time"" expenses from paying off my car and my furniture loan.  A more reasonable number for my annual spend is $22,700.

With my car payment gone, my highest expense category is Food, averaging $500 per month.  This has room for improvement. 

Healthcare will look artificially low last year because of taking Tax Credits up front.  This year I am not and will be paying $325 per month for health insurance.  At ~$4000 per year, this puts healthcare at nearly 20% of my total expenses.

Nothing else is particularly interesting.  That $22,700 figure is a reasonable real-world number for me, but for future planning I'd still inflate that to $25,000 just to have more wiggle room.  I may look into traveling this year, which would add some expense.

**Investments:**

Vanguard Investments: (All in VTSAX)

* Traditional IRA:  $299,000 -> $348,000
* Roth IRA: $14,500 -> $18,150
* Brokerage: $18,400 -> $22,900

* **Total Rollup**: $331,800 -> $389,100.  ~17% return

Other LTCG holdings: $145,000 -> $291,000 (other investment accounts and bitcoin)

HSA Investment Account: $6000 -> $7400, with another $1700 in the ""cash"" holdings of the HSA.

$9000 cash in Money Market & Checking Account.

**Finances Going Forward**

I had earned income last year so I didn't start my Roth Conversion Ladder last year.   This year I decided I will be converting the $12,400 standard deduction + $9600 of the first tax bracket for a nice round $22,000 converted.   Yes I'll owe a little bit of taxes, but it sets up my Roth with $22k in 5 years which should cover the majority of my expenses.  And with $350k currently in tIRA and converting $22,000 per year, I won't be able to chew through it all before actual retirement age.

I have about $20k from an old stock purchase plan that unlocks come April, which I will be selling and likely moving over to my money market account to shore up my ""cash"" holdings.

My plan is to not really tap any of my ""normal"" investment accounts for as long as possible.  I've been deferring to selling Bitcoin if I need to move some cash over.  Last year I sold 3 bitcoin, one for $9300 in June, and then two at the end of December (for tax year Capital Gains reasons) for $7300 each.  These were all LTCG at 0% taxed.   AGI for last year is around $35,000.  

**The Living Part:**

There's all the boring expenses and financial stuff.  Now for the ever painful question that my beloved Grandmother loves to ask, ""But gosh, what do you do with all of your time!  I can't imagine being retired at your age!""

Step 1, restful sleep.  During my working career I lived off 6 hours of sleep every day.  It made for exhausting weekends trying to ""make it up.""  And luckily I'm not a generally stressful person or else it'd have been worse.  But now I go to bed when I'm tired, and whenever I naturally wake up, I get up.  This can lead to VERY weird hours since I'm often an extreme night owl.   But I generally get 9-10 perfect restful uninterrupted dream-filled hours of sleep.

I'm betrayed by my ""Food Expense"" breakdown, but I really am cooking more and eating better.  I drink a lot of coffee and water at home and generally try to eat only one meal per day, but sometimes lunch and dinner.  I don't normally eat breakfast, just have coffee when I wake up.  And did I mention how much less painful it is to go grocery shopping when it's in the middle of the day and everyone's at work.  It's so nice.

I spend a lot of time on reddit browsing my front page, and I check out the YouTubers I follow that post daily, then check out any of the irregular posters.   Depending on how much good stuff there is, this could go on for a few hours.

I have a lot of hours playing video games.  I tend toward puzzle games or building games (Factorio, Satisfactory) because they scratch that itch in my engineering brain.   There are times at night where I'll spend **hours** on this website: https://www.puzzle-sudoku.com/ and play Sudoku or Nonograms or any of the other puzzle types on the bottom of the page.

I'm doing my best to watch every single last show on Netflix.  It's a daunting task, though it's surprising how often I drift back toward watching the same smattering of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes rather than try something new.  But I try and take recommendations and work my way through shows.

And Podcasts!   The joy of joys is when I come across a new-to-me podcast that has a huge backlog.  I found a great ST:TNG rewatch podcast that had 108 episodes already done.  I spent like 2 months watching the episode of TNG then immediately listening to their podcast about that episode, repeat repeat repeat.   I'm currently working my way through The Adventure Zone, I'm on episode 46 of 155 with them.  And they keep advertising the other podcasts The McElroys do so I'm sure I'll roll into one of those next.   For many people podcasts are background noise, but I'll often just sit on the couch and concentrate on just listening the podcast.

Outside of home, I can't wait for the weather to get nicer so I can go on more walks.  Being a night owl I like going for walks at night.  I live near our city center so I'm within blocks of city hall, the main library branch, and the fountain / park.

I jump at any opportunity to hang out with friends.  It's just about every weekend that we are getting together to hang out and play board games.  Like I mentioned in one of the breakdowns, I've started to play D&D with my buddy and his wife.  I'd never played before but he's been DMing for years (but hasn't had a group for 10+ years now).  He's glad to be playing again, his wife **loves** it, and it's super convenient for them to stay home with the 5 month old daughter.  (And baby gets to hang out with Uncle Oracle.)

I get together with former co-workers every few months to keep in touch with them.  One in particular I have a standing every-2-month bar date with.   I remind them every so often that if they want to go out to lunch **ever** to just call me.

**Personal History**

Just a quick personal history in closing.  I was an automotive engineer working for OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in the Metro Detroit area.  In the 2008 downturn I lost my job and was unemployed for 2 years and ended up getting my house foreclosed in 2010.  By the time i got a job in March of 2010 I was basically at $0.  I had a tiny amount in an 401k, had about $20,000 in credit card debt from being unemployed.

But then I got a very well paying engineering job ($108k annual and eligible for time-and-half overtime).  I kept living like I was unemployed, spent as little as possible and saved as much as possible.  Through my parents I secured a mortgage on a nice 1 Bed / 1 Bath 900 sq ft condo.  I paid off my CC debt in less than a year and kept banking cash and maxing my 401k every year.

I heard about bitcoin in early 2013 (from a guildmate in World of Warcraft, believe it or not) and jumped on board.  [All time bitcoin price chart (log scale) for those unfamiliar with the history.](https://i.imgur.com/NkJ2BMR.png) I got in before the first spike to $1000 in December of 2013, and kept buying throughout the downswing in 2014 / 2015.   In 2017 I sold 5.6 BTC for a total of $6000 and paid off the last of my student loans and my car, then a few months later I sold 4.25 BTC for $6700 and paid off the last of my condo mortgage.  So in May of 2017 I was officially debt free and had a net worth of about $200,000.

Then in the fall of 2017 was when bitcoin exploded.  I knew I had to take profits here.   Every time the price went up 10% I sold another bitcoin.  $7500, $9000, $10700, $13000, $15500, $18600.  I sold all the way up.   I ended up selling about $100,000 in bitcoin that year and I pushed most of it into my Roth IRA and Brokerage accounts.

Then I really started thinking about FIRE in early 2018.  Started doing the math, tried to see what my expenses would be, and thought I'd give it ago.   I've told myself from day 1 that I'd give this trial a solid 2 years.   If I don't feel good about it, or the money doesn't seem right, then I'll still only be 40 years old and could (IMO) easily jump right back into an engineering gig.  So I targeted early 2019 so I could frontload my 401k for two months, grab the annual bonus, then peace out.

152,Early Retirement Update (EOY 2020),,1004.0,ko2559,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ko2559/early_retirement_update_eoy_2020/,1609463330.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (with home/land). Our actual withdrawal rate is much less than the original 3% of portfolio due to: occasionally earning additional passive income; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (below). The budgeted maximum withdrawal amount for 2021 is $3,904/mo or $46,858/yr (now 2% of net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We‚Äôre so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an ebay business while in college ($10k), and student loans ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average. My parents initially promised to cover the student loans out of what they deemed to be principle, but we assumed them when purchasing their home/farm in 2019 ($380k + assumption of student loans + free rent for life, for an estimated $750k home/farm that is now probably closer to $900k).

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was initially 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents‚Äô home/farm, our net worth is closer to 50% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another house with 66 acres) / 50% VTSAX (total US stock market). We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment, social security, other inheritances, universal health care, or universal basic income. The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**2020 RECAP**

**Spending**: Living expenses for 2020 came to $39,458 (max budget $41,736). We generated $8,045 of income this year from some almost entirely passive stuff. Our investment withdrawal was $31,413 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.51% for the year (max budget 2%). Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 1.89% for the year. Spending guideline for 2021 will be $46,858 (2% of net worth). Our net worth has gone from $1,333,772 (start) to $2,342,926 (current). Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out, got all of it back, and padded the portfolio even further. The New York Times reached out to me again in March to see if I was financially ruined, but I had to disappoint them.

**Experiences**: I ran nearly 2000 miles after my competitive running career came to a close (personal records: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). That‚Äôs way down from 3000 miles in 2019, but I switched over to cycling (2000 miles) primarily during the summer (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete). I allowed the pandemic and others‚Äô imbecilic denial of reality surrounding the pandemic to make this a less productive year. I mostly stayed home and stuck with existing hobbies (reading, gaming, watching movies, web browsing, vintage card/nintendo collecting, hiking, bird watching, shopping for my parents, following the near demise of our republic). I even reapplied with my old employer and the state volunteer medical core to help with immunizations for the upcoming year, but I am apparently not wanted.

**Upcoming**: In 2021, I want to get vaccinated so that I can return to society, learn to swim effectively without a snorkel, learn to play some basic piano, look into becoming a race director, continue running for my physical/mental health, find some new volunteer opportunities, decrease my time in the digital world, spend more time with existing hobbies, make up for lost traveling (California #3, Hawaii #2, Japan #3), and continue to do whatever the fuck I want.",277.0,financialindependence

I think it's not a realistic position if you want to maintain relationships with people you grew up with if you're from a low income background. 

I'm from a very low income background (daughter of migrant farm workers) as is my husband. We each come from families where we each have 30+ cousins and are very close with our extended families. My husband salary is quite obviously high, as he is a nurse in a top hospital. I'm in a job position that many people are familiar with but don't actually know can earn quite a bit of money, so I'm able to hide my salary more. 

So, if you come from a very tight knit community, how do you deal with the wealth gap? Do you encounter a lot of guilt when your family and friends are suffering? I always wish that I could help everyone, but I also don't want to fall into the trap and become poor again myself. My husband and I both agreed that we would pay off our parents mortgages. This then helps our siblings too, because if anyone is ever struggling or homeless, they have a place to stay without a steep mortgage. 

But then I have my friends. The community I was raised in had very strict values, similar to the ""snitches get stitches"" mentality, where you shouldn't be doing well if you're friends are struggling.

I FIREd last year at 45.

Ha! That whole ""what happens if you retire at the height of the great depression?""

I may be testing that.

However currently things are actually good. Its been a quiet year for me on the home font. 

Since I am FI already I'm not stressed about not going in to work or trying to work from home or hoping not to get laid off.  My checking and saving have enough to get me though for quite a while. 

I have basically been on my own ""social isolation"" for a year. Its hard to have a social life when all your friends and ex- coworkers are busy with employment!  I was catching up with all the new release moves until the shutdown. 

I have finally been able to catch up on a bunch of the games I neglected over the past few years. My biggest ""splurge"" was building a new PC to play the modern games.  I enjoyed ""The Outer Worlds"" and Fallout 4 has been great. Epic has been giving away games weekly so I have a bunch in my library I haven't even had a chance to try. 

My health has actually dramatically improved since I no longer have to deal with the stresses of my old job. I am able to cook at home and not not eat out as much.  I lost a bunch of weight and all my vital stats are back in the green!  Still plenty of room to improve.  I was getting out and doing some exercise before Covid. That has died down and I really should get back to walking a bit more, even if I need to wear a mask. 

My net worth has taken a bit of a hit but I still have enough ""slack"" in my budget that I'm not stressing. I even picked up a little stock that I feel will do well in the next couple of years. I'm not going hog wild but I'm betting on an eventual recovery even if it takes a while. I have some time. 

My main yearly worry is heath insurance and how to deal with it. Since I can control my conversion from my 401k/ira into my Roth I can have enough ""income"" to qualify for ACA. That's my current plan until we finally fix the heath care system in this country.

Extreme saving to build up capital equaling 25x your expenses is one way to achieve FIRE. 
Retirement, in the traditional sense of retiring to a life of no particular work responsibilities is one type of retirement. 
BaristaFIREing to a quiet life of easy work is another option. 

All of these things have names. But all of these things are merely arbitrary points on a spectrum of infinite possibilities. Life isn't a forking path, with traditional FIRE going one way, with baristaFIRE pointing in the other direction, and no middle ground between them. You're ""allowed"" to retire to a life based on the 6% rule, with baristafire as a backup. You're allowed to become financially independent and never quit your job if you don't feel like it. You're allowed to retire at 32 fully FI, get bored, start a pottery studio, live off the income from the pottery studio for a while, get bored, close it down, then get a job with the county government cutting down trees. Life is too short to limit your choices to the default options on a forum. 

I think everyone here is aware of this, on some level. But, really  often on this sub, I see people falling into the easy ruts, like treating the 4% rule as an actual rule. Or, they let the easily defined concepts, like coastFIRE, define their goals, when it's pretty clear based on reading their writing that their real goal should be in the Grey Area Of FIRE That Has No Name Yet. Grey Area Fire That Has No Name Yet is perfectly fine.

I thought I would share my story since I enjoy hearing how other people are doing on their path to FIRE. I have laid it out effectively in terms of school years since I still think in those terms. I only discovered FIRE in the last three years so I also don‚Äôt know my net worth for most years but have included estimates that are likely close.

**College and background**

I grew up in a low income household and felt very poor. Ended up at a highly selective liberal arts school. Their financial aid was pretty great at first but fell off a bit. I remember paying only $4,000 for my first year. This jumped to about $10,000 per year for the next three years. Not bad for the experience though. I had only saved a few thousand for college and I wasn‚Äôt excited about the prospect of debt, so I worked during school. 25-30 hours a week generally. On top of a very difficult course load (40-60 hours a week on coursework) I ended up feeling very tired and stressed. Looking back I regret working so much. I didn‚Äôt even make that much money really.

I studied Physics. A friend of mine tried to get me to take Economics, but it never fit my schedule. I tried to take a Computer Science course, but I couldn‚Äôt take it due to demand. I regret both of these things.

**Year 1 (June 2012):**

**Salary $52,000 Cash $12,000 Debt $17,000 NW $-5,000**

While I had always wanted to get a Doctorate, I became disillusioned with the post graduate school job market and decided to enter industry instead. I started working at a small manufacturing company as a Physicist/Manufacturing Engineer. It turns out there are not a lot of options to pursue as a physicist. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing but at least there wasn‚Äôt too much pressure on me. Moved to a MCOL area.

Paid off my debts in several months thanks to dirt cheap living expenses (<$1000/month). This was thanks to $400/month rent due to sharing a house with four other people in a not great part of town. I didn‚Äôt really track my net worth. I just deposited money in my checking account and tried not to spend too much. I think I put around 8% in my 401k. Looking back, I should have maxed it.

**Year 2:**

**Salary $57,000 NW $20,000?**

Not much to report here. Just worked. Started graduate school part time in Mechanical Engineering. I felt a lack of options with only a Physics degree and felt I would have more options with an MSME. Probably a great choice especially since my work paid for it. I also initially enjoyed classes.

**Year 3:**

**Salary $63,000 NW $50,000?**

I bought the house that I was renting. I probably overpaid for it, but I rented out rooms so it more than paid the mortgage. I guess I was house hacking. It really was about doing something with the money that was just accumulating in my savings account. Investing was scary to me. I borrowed $25,000 from my mother to help me cover the deposit and avoid PMI. I agreed to pay her back over the next 2.5 years.

I also got engaged this year. More on this later. I continued taking classes.

**Year 4:**

**Salary $70,000 NW $100,000?**

I got married! My wife was an artist so didn‚Äôt bring in very much money but also was debt free. We kept two renters, but they no longer covered the mortgage. Between a decrease in rent, paying for healthcare for my wife (an extra $400/month), and paying back my mother, things felt very tight. I kept contributing to my 401k though. This brought a fair amount of stress to the relationship. **I highly recommend talking about earning expectations before marriage.** We talked about everything else, but somehow this didn‚Äôt come up. I think in part because I was doing fine on my own and didn‚Äôt connect the loss of rental income plus increased expenses with marriage. What we did that helped was to budget. This was absolutely critical.

**Year 5:**

**Salary $77,000 NW $140,000?**

This was a big year in many ways. Finished graduate school. Woo! Unfortunately part way through graduate school I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be an engineer. I enjoyed the business side of work and should have gotten an MBA.

My wife applied to graduate school as we decided she needed to have a more steady career. We paid off the loan to my mother. The payment was the size of a mortgage, so it felt like we finally had some breathing room.

Perhaps most importantly, this was the year that I discovered FIRE. This was good because I really started disliking my job at some point this year.  **Started maxing my 401k.**

**Year 6:**

**Salary $87,000 NW $175,000?**

I got promoted at work and started managing a team of engineers. I again liked my job though it was more stressful. I also applied to MBA programs. Missed out on top tiers schools (screwing up my Wharton interview is a very sad memory) but got an offer for full tuition at a mid-tier. Thanks to the promotion I decided to do part time grad school again since the company would pay for it. This was painful but probably a good choice.

Started ROTH IRAs for myself and my wife. My wife started graduate school. She worked part time as well. Between part-time work and scholarships, most if not all of the cost was covered.

**Year 7:**

**Salary: $95,000 NW $250,000**

Started grad school. Sold my house and moved to a small 1 BR apartment in a nice part of the city we live in. It was nice to get money out of the house and be able to invest it. I didn‚Äôt make a ton from the house sale but it lowered stress. Home ownership, especially for an older home, requires a lot of work.

Started tracking balances every 2 weeks. Felt like this was a good balance of knowing what is happening without getting obsessed.

**Year 8:**

**Salary: $123,000 NW $325,000**

I finished grad school part 2. Wife finished graduate school. I negotiated for a much higher salary at work. Started disliking work again though. Unfortunately covid happened so my wife was furloughed and went to doing gig work. She definitely made some money but it isn‚Äôt included in salary here. Started to finally not feel poor as well. That may be silly that it took so long but growing poor leaves marks that take a long time to fade. Something about hitting a significant income level and living in a nicer spot made a big difference.

**Year 8.5 (Present)**

**Salary: $130,000 NW $400,000**

I accepted a job offer in a HCOL/VHCOL city. I will be making less when accounting for cost of living differences, but I think I will enjoy it more and have more growth options (edit: its a technical marketing role). My wife also just started work (another \~$60,000/year). The last time I checked finances we just crossed $400,000, which felt like a big milestone. Hitting six figures in a taxable account just happened as well and this was very exciting.

**My recommendations**:

1. Use a budget. I have had a high savings rate thanks to budgeting.
2. Max out your 401k early (unless it is a terrible fund or something). It will hurt but you can get used to it.
3. Talk about earnings/career expectations before marriage. Create a budget together before getting married.
4. Invest in yourself. Doing part time grad school twice was a good career choice even though it was very difficult. My company paid for it both times.
5. Home ownership can be a great vehicle for wealth building. I found it stressful and detracted from work. Investing in myself and my career will likely end up being a better choice for me. YMMV.

Thanks for reading and for all of the encouragement that this community provides!

Edit: I got a question about NW allocation:

\- Savings: $50K (about to buy a car and move so have been hoarding cash for the last few months)

\- 401K: $185K

\- Roth IRA: $60K

\- Brokerage: $105K

Further edit: target number is $1.25 million. Probably another 12-15 years of work.  


Last edit: A fair number of comments about whether or not I was poor growing up. I grew up in a single-parent family as the youngest of four children. We were below the poverty line until I was at least 12 when a second sibling moved out. I was on free school lunches until it was just me and then I was on reduced school lunches. My mother was a saver who had a full-time job and always took part time gig work as well. So once she was able to save due to her kids moving out, she did. That is why she was able to loan me money at that point (20+ years from when my dad left her). I am sure that plenty of people have worse situations than mine, but I assure you, we were indeed poor when I was young. ",313.0,financialindependence

1. I‚Äôm not working a high paying job. I actually FIREd 5 years ago and am living off my investments.
2. Last year I lived in 4 different countries and traveled to 11 others
3. My expenses for 2019 were 70% less than the average American in a MCOL city
4. I‚Äôm still eating out, being social, and traveling extensively

I did a [Q3‚Äô2019 Spending update](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/dobzp3/overseas_fire_spending_update_q3_2019/) a few months ago. Based on the feedback of that post, rather than just review my Q4 2019 spending, I did a full year review: this breaks down my spending, my income, my investments, and a brief pro/con of places I lived.

**2019 Highlights**

* $1,000,000+: invested retirement assets as of Jan 2020
* 5: Number of Years FIREd
* 11%: Year over Year growth to reach One Million Dollars
* 2.6%: Withdrawal Rate as % of Beginning of the Year balance of Retirement Savings
* $22,000: Annual passive income generated from invested retirement assets (cash flow only, excludes appreciation)
* 15: Number of countries visited
* 0: Number of 10-second handstands held (was my goal for the year)

**UPDATE**: As of February 29th, I am no longer a member of the 2 comma club. But F\*ck It, I took a long time getting this information together and writing this post. I‚Äôm not shelving it because of a bad cough named after a crap beer.

Besides, I think it‚Äôs even more relevant. Though my Net Worth has dropped due to market volatility, I‚Äôve diversified enough that my WR doesn‚Äôt change. The passive income from my investments is still 1.8X my annual expenses.

The changes I have made in 2019 have given me additional levers to pull and reduce my spending level even further if there is a protracted market correction.

**2019 Year in Review**

Homebases:

***Q1: Medellin, Colombia***

PROS: Medellin has become one of my favorite cities. The weather is literally the best I have ever experienced: not humid, spring temperatures, no bugs, [mountain views](https://imgur.com/NE20EZx), lots of green. Cost of living is lower than many places I have lived in SE Asia.

CONS: While SIGNIFICANTLY safer than 25 years ago (Pablo Escobar died 1993), you still have to take precautions (take cabs at night, be extra vigilant of your belongings, never take your eye off your drink, etc) that I wouldn‚Äôt take in any of the other cities I lived this year.

***Q2: Vienna, Austria***

PROS: Voted the most ‚ÄúLivable city in the world‚Äù for the second year in a row, it‚Äôs easy to fall in love with Vienna. The city is drop dead gorgeous. Public transportation is extensive. The culture and arts scene is world class.

CONS: It‚Äôs expensive. It‚Äôs still cheaper than a MCOL city in the US (roughly equivalent to Kansas City, Mo), but about twice the price of Medellin. Also, it‚Äôs a Schengen Agreement country, which means US Citizens only get 90 days out of every 180 days to live there (or any of the 26 other European Schengen countries). Schengen is a pain in the ass visa situation for me, which led me to applying for a Retirement Visa in Spain this year. Results and process to the Spain Visa to be posted in the near future.

Additional cities visited: Slovenia, Croatia (Dubrovnik), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Mostar). Austria‚Äôs central location in Europe allows for easy trips via bus, train, and cheap flights. I took a one week trip through the Balkans to [Dubrovnik while watching the final season of Game of Thrones](https://imgur.com/CrTW2Pt).

***Q3: Sofia, Bulgaria***

This was the [subject of my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/dobzp3/overseas_fire_spending_update_q3_2019/), so rather than repeat, you can read up on what Sofia was like. TL;DR- Bulgaria is extremely underrated: beautiful mountains, [sunny beaches](https://imgur.com/OqUPVtJ), and low cost of living.

Additional cities visited: Austria (Vienna), Czechia (Prague), Serbia (Belgrade), Bulgaria (Plovdiv and Rila).

***Q4: Limassol, Cyprus***

PROS: Sunshine for days. Seriously. Cyprus averages 340 sunny days a year. We lived a [15 minute walk to the beach](https://imgur.com/a/7NAWhNQ). Cypriots are very friendly folks. Had the workings of a social circle forming, which makes any place 10 X better.

CONS: It‚Äôs expensive. Also not worth the cost, which makes any place 10 X worse. COL is roughly equal to Vienna, but has none of the advantages. Urban sprawl is a significant issue. Walkablility is restricted and public transportation is scarce. Food choices are limited (every meal involves meat on a stick). Our shared flat was $450 per month and I felt like I was [re-living my impoverished college days](https://imgur.com/IME4AKU).

Other cities visited: Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Kyrenia), [Israel (Jerusalem)](https://imgur.com/3ETPzLf), Palestine (Bethlehem), Italy (Rome), USA (Las Vegas).

**Income:**

|(In USD)|**Full Year 2019**|
|:-|:-|
|Dividend and Interest Income|10,383|
|Rental Income|19,111|
|Rental Expenses|(8,090)|
|Misc Bonus|933|
|**Annual Income Average**|**22,336**|
|*Monthly Income*|*1,861*|

***Dividends and Interest:*** Earned roughly 1.7% in dividends and interest. I have moved about 18% of my funds into VYM, a Vanguard High Yield ETF, which pays about 3.3% in dividends. This was a mid-year move, so 2020 should have a higher amount here.

***Rental Income:*** I had zero vacancies this year, which both increases my income and decreases my expenses. I like my renter, hopefully she will re-up this year with a modest 3.5% increase.

***Rental Expenses:***

Homeowners Association (HOA) Dues - $4,211

Property Taxes - $2519

My two biggest rental expenses and I have no control over either. The dues covers maintenance, insurance on the property, a movie theater, pool, hot tub, gym, billiard room, and racquetball court.

Management Fees - $1077

I changed property managers last year, and it‚Äôs been great. My new manager charges me 5% per month plus one month of rent if we have to find new tenants. Other than an occasional email to approve a maintenance request, this income is truly passive.

Renters Insurance - $140

Cleaning and Maintenance - $1410

***Misc Bonus:*** I received $900 as a sign up bonus for rolling over my 401K to a Merrill Edge IRA. But the bigger story here is I lost THOUSANDS because I was a lazy dumba\*s and kept my previous 401K in my prior employer‚Äôs plan for 5 years. This cost me $90 a month in 401K fees to T. Rowe Price. $90 a month FOR 5 YEARS. It‚Äôs my own fault for not paying attention. Sometimes I wanna kick my own ass.

As an added bonus, my account with Merrill boosts my cash back reward on my Bank of America card to 2.6%.

**Expenses:**

|(In USD)|**Total for 2019**|**Per Month Avg**|**% of Spending**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Food|4,303|359|35%|
|Housing|2,735|228|23%|
|International Flights|1,741|145|12%|
|Health Care|1,064|89|9%|
|Fitness|959|80|8%|
|Shopping|715|60|6%|
|Transportation|461|38|4%|
|Entertainment|122|10|1%|
|Utilities|62|5|1%|
|**Total Spending**|**12,163**|**1,014**||

*\*Note expenses above are only my costs. My girlfriend and I shared expenses. Her share is NOT included in the numbers above.*

My expenses for 2019 are the lowest I have ever had. 2019 is the first full year I have had a girlfriend living with me and splitting my living expenses. Having a partner really drives my COL lower than I expected. She pays for 50% the rent and 40% of the food budget. In addition, I don‚Äôt go out partying as much, so my alcohol and nightclub budget is drastically reduced. With the side benefit of watching her wake up and smile at me every morning, this was a major savings bonus.

***Top 4 Expenses:***

***Food:*** Continues to be my biggest expense, even with the GF paying 40%. No way around the fact I‚Äôm a wanna-be fat ass. I detail why my food budget is expensive in the [Q3 post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/dobzp3/overseas_fire_spending_update_q3_2019/) Check it out for details. TL;DR- I eat a protein heavy diet (equivalent to FIVE 4 oz (114 g) steaks a day) and I avoid simple starches (potatos, rice, pasta, etc) that could fill me up on the cheap.

***Housing:*** For four months this year, we were house sitting in Vienna. I would not choose to live in an expensive city, but my girlfriend is Austrian and she has family about a one-hour train ride away. House sitting provided me the opportunity to keep my housing costs low (I estimate our flat would have [rented for around $1,000 per month](https://imgur.com/eRhbM52)), while living in a beautiful expensive city, and at the same time making my girlfriend happy. Definition of a WIN/WIN.

Excluding house sitting, we spend between $320 to $500 per month TOTAL ($160 to $250 each). In LCOL cities such as [Medellin, Colombia](https://imgur.com/uOZfx27) and Sofia, Bulgaria, $500 per month covers shared housing in desirable upper-middle-class neighborhoods.

***International Flights:***

Two trans-Atlantic and one trans-Pacific drive the bulk of this cost. Flights within Europe continue to be shockingly inexpensive. Deal of day for me was the $45 round trip Cyprus to Israel flight that allowed me to visit the Middle East for the first time in my life.

* Medellin, Colombia to London, England = $370
* London, England to Vienna = $65
* Dubrovnik to Vienna= $77
* Vienna, Austria to Varna, Bulgaria = $20
* Varna, Bulgaria to Larnaca, Cyprus = $30
* Cyprus to Israel (round trip) = $45
* Larnaca, Cyprus to Skopje, Macedonia= $19
* Skopje, Macedonia to [Rome, Italy](https://imgur.com/a/vHNjNBQ) = $20
* Rome, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada $230
* Las Vegas to Manila= $375

***Healthcare and Insurance:***

* Travel Health Insurance = $680
* ACA Subsidized US Insurance = $230
* Out of Pocket = $154

These numbers do not include my HSA contribution of $3,500. I count that as a long term investment, not an expense.

I discussed my healthcare strategy in my prior post, but to recap, I have a three tier approach:

1. Use Local Healthcare for out of pocket costs. As a rule, I can get all routine checkups and medical tests done cheaper overseas. [Out of Pocket Health Care Costs](https://imgur.com/a/98uoXPN)
2. Travel insurance is my transition safety net. If something more significant happens that can‚Äôt be handled in a country I am living in, travel insurance is used to stabilize me and get me to the US. My travel insurance, which covers me WORLDWIDE (except the US) is $680 per year.
3. US insurance for anything catastrophic. Once my travel insurance brings me back to the US, ""Obamacare"" takes over. I have an ACA subsidized High Deductible Silver plan. This plan allows me to invest in Health Savings Accounts (HSA). I rarely use US medical care. But \*knock on wood\*, if anything catastrophic happens, my ACA is my fallback.

As part of the Spain Retirement visa I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I am required to have Spanish Private Health Insurance. I have a future post I‚Äôm writing on cost and coverage of Private Health Insurance (non-government-subsidized) in Europe vs. Worldwide Travel Insurance vs. US Health Insurance.

**Invested Assets:**

\*Amounts rounded for privacy

|Retirement Accounts (Trad. IRA, Roth IRA, HSA)|END OF YEAR 2019|
|:-|:-|
|VTI|315,000|
|VYM|130,000|
|QQQ|110,000|
|Other|160,038|
|**Total Retirement Accounts**|**715,038**|
|||
|Real Estate|285,000|
|**Total Invested Assets**|**1,000,038**|

***ETFs and Index Funds:*** The bulk of my investments are ETFs. 78% of my retirement assets are in three funds: VTI (Vanguard Total Market ETF), VYM (Vanguard High Yield ETF), and QQQ (Invesco QQQ NASDAQ 100 ETF).

I am still in the process of transferring and consolidating my positions. There is \~$160,000 in random funds from a previous account that will be moving into the funds above in 2020. 

***Real Estate:*** 28% of my retirement assets are in a single unit condominium rental with no mortgage. As mentioned previously, the rental generates \~$11,000 in cash that pays for my living expenses.

***Real Estate Value***:  I update my real estate value once a year since there isn‚Äôt an accurate real-time way of getting appraisal costs. Sales of identical units in my condominium complex drive the estimated home value above.

**2019 Key Lessons Learned**

***Hitting the One Million Dollar mark felt good, but it does not fundamentally change anything I‚Äôll be doing.***

I‚Äôm tracking well under the 4% SWR benchmark. I‚Äôve lowered my sequence of returns risk with five years of Early Retirement. I don‚Äôt plan to ‚Äúreset‚Äù my SWR and my annual spending is unlikely to change.

**‚Äã**Compared to a MCOL city in the US, I am saving about 70% in living expenses. I don't make sacrifices in my standard of living. In some countries, my reduced monthly expenses still includes maid service and dining out once a day.

***Hitting One Million Dollars gives me more of a cushion.***

Even if the market continues to fall, I won't panic and make significant withdrawals from my retirement funds. I have set myself up for 2020 to reduce expenses further to prevent selling into a downturn.¬†

As an example:

* I‚Äôm ready for a home base. I don‚Äôt plan to stop traveling, but I‚Äôm looking to make Spain home base for the foreseeable future. Living in a new country long term will mean less international flights and more domestic day trips. International flights were one of my Top 3 expenses last year.
* Shopping and Food expense can be reduced. Every move I have has a ""start up cost"", as I buy a new blender, knives, pans, bed linens, towels, and cooking supplies. Settling down will reduce my upfront costs.

**2019 Summary**

It was a good year. Got a girl. Got the cash. Earned $22K in passive income. Spent $12K, while traveling to 15 countries. For 2020, I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my Spain retirement visa and for the Coronavirus to F\*ck Off.

Real Estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion in this sub so please consider if this isn't for you, it doesn't mean it's not helpful to someone. This post is for anyone that is willing to consider real estate as part of their portfolio.

I'm talking about holding physical real estate with a bank loan or mortgage. If that's not for you, consider REITs. Personally, I don't own any REITs since I own physical real estate but they have consistently proved to be less volatile and more profitable than total market indexes. [Average REIT Returns vs Stocks Over Long Periods](https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/comparing-average-reit-returns-and-stocks-over-long-periods)

In truth, physical real estate is one of the most powerful and accessible tools for people with common jobs to build wealth. I don't need to rehash why, as hundreds of articles have done before. [Why Real Estate Builds Wealth More Consistently Than Other Asset Classes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgreene/2018/11/27/why-real-estate-builds-wealth-more-consistently-than-other-asset-classes/#69a0ba2a5405)

Lastly, below's an illustration of a recent change I made that I hope resonates with the younger FIRE community. I went from living in a shared 2-bedroom apartment to a one-bedroom apartment, and am saving an extra $1296 per month doing it. How so? I invested $62k and bought a multi-family home, living in one unit and renting out the other 3. Don't have $62k for a down payment? You probably qualify for a FHA loan for 3.5% down. Below is my expense breakdown for the first month of ownership. My only regret is not doing it sooner... and cashing on in the current 3% 30-year fixed mortgage.

There's lots of advice about churning credit cards, cut out cable, reduce their cellphone bill, etc for a few hundred bucks a year. What about looking at your unused or underutilized assets. In this real estate focused post, that could mean renting out and extra room or garage.

While I love my VTSAX for it's simplicity and returns, I expect this investment will have 2-4x the returns of VTSAX and add diversification to my portfolio.

Edit: I should add I've been a landlord for 8 years but this is my first owner-occupied property. I stand by the fact I have 9 units and have done nothing but collect rent and place 2 tenants in the past year. I'm not living in some fairytale where I don't understand the work required.

There's also already a fair amount of people warning others about the dangers and pitfalls. Good, everyone should know the risk and it's not for everyone.

I should add the 2-4x VTSAX is largely based on leverage home appreciation. Cash flow is more in line with 1-1.2x VTSAX and requires some work.",460.0,financialindependence

In April I started working on a net worth tracker for myself. Somewhere along the way it morphed into a sheet for friends, family, and anyone looking to get a hold of their finances. The goal of the sheet is provide you certainty about your financial situation in a time of uncertainty.

Advantages of the sheet over other net worth trackers:

* 100% Free
* No APIs that constantly break. Other trackers that have APIs have to constantly update them and experience periods where the connection is broken.
* Your data is yours. We have no access to your data when you make a copy.
* The sheet is setup to last for many years with minimal to no updates
* Full user guide to make the sheet easy to learn and use

Highlights of the sheet:

* Motivating goal tracking
* Customizable dashboard
* High level of detail if you want it, high level overviews if you don't
* Ability to track self employed users
* Ability to track individuals and couples
* Wedding expense tracker if you need it

In addition to the sheet, I created a full user guide to allow you to jump in and start taking control of your finances.

## Intro ##

> Should I include my house in my net worth calculations for FIRE?

This question has been beaten to death on this subreddit, and the best answer is usually along the lines of:

> You can include your house‚Äôs principal in your total net worth, but what matters for calculating your FIRE number is the amount of investible assets which will generate the returns to fuel your spending in retirement. Even if your house appreciates in value, those assets aren‚Äôt giving you a liquid return unless you take out a loan against them, which probably isn‚Äôt the best idea for your primary dwelling.

But I‚Äôve never liked this answer, for the reason that eventually your mortgage will be paid off and your monthly housing expenses will drop. This throws a wrench in using your current monthly spending to estimate how much money you will need to spend in retirement, and it annoyed me enough at work today that I figured I‚Äôd solve it. This post is an attempt to give the best approximation I can to how you should really account for a mortgage when planning for FIRE, and just how many years of your life you are leaving on the table if you don‚Äôt do this.

----

## Once a Mortgage is Gone, It‚Äôs Gone ##

Say that you buy a $500k house, and put $100k down in order to avoid PMI. You get a 30 year mortgage at 4.25% APR. Your monthly mortgage payment will be:

    $400 000 * (0.0425/12)/(1-(1+0.0425/12)^(-(30*12))) = $1968

If we assume a 4% safe withdrawal rate, the amount we have to save to cover our mortgage payments using the standard SWR calculation tells us that in order to FIRE we need to accumulate:

    $1968 * 12 / 0.04 = $590 328

For context, your total payments over the life of the mortgage will be $1968 \* 30 \* 12 = $708 393, entirely generated by that invested sum, and this is a good bit more than just paying the entire $400 000 balance of the outstanding principal outright!

But I contend that this is a silly way to do things, since this means you will be have that $1968 every month in perpetuity. A ‚Äúsafe‚Äù way perhaps, but considering that a) that is a huge amount of money to save up (more than the total purchase price of the house!) and b) the greatest sequence of returns risk is in the early years of FIRE and 30 years down the road the extra padding will likely not be needed, this is unnecessarily conservative.

So how should we account for things instead? I would argue that the portion of your monthly spending allocated to mortgage payments should be accounted for in your FIRE budgeting using draw-down calculations. In other words, you should spend your mortgage-allocated invested assets at a rate such that they reach a value of 0 on your last mortgage payment, while still accounting for the fact that they will be generating returns throughout that entire time.

Luckily this is pretty easy in a spreadsheet ‚Äì it‚Äôs precisely the formula for calculating the Present Value of an asset. Assuming a 7% investment return, here‚Äôs how much you need to save using the draw-down method:

    =PV(0.07/12, 30*12, -$1968, $0) = $295 769

This is half of what the SWR calculation would tell you!

You can [check out my spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7Y692E_Za0nqJRJJbkerAEdFrQ8ut0dZUqTSqcAwXg/edit?usp=sharing) to see the calculation in action, check the formula against a manual month-by-month calculation, and make a copy of the spreadsheet to try out your own values. Cells in yellow mark the inputs.

## Your Money or Your Life ##

What does this mean in terms of how long you have before reaching FIRE? I‚Äôll grab my NPER() calculation from an older post of mine, [Tips and Tricks for your FIRE Spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5cmanl/tips_and_tricks_for_your_fire_spreadsheets/) so check there for how I calculated these times. Note also that since you pay down the mortgage through this time, there is a circular calculation that has to happen to update the 


Assume you have $60k / yr in non-mortgage spending, $50k / yr in investment savings (a post-tax SR of 37% after including the $1968 \* 12 = $26.3k /yr towards the mortgage), and current invested assets of $0. Now we calculate the time needed to hit the targets needed to cover the mortgage by putting all our savings towards it:

    SWR Method:       $590 k, 8.6 years
    Pay off in Full:  $400 k, 6.4 years
    Draw-down Method: $296 k, 5.0 years

But you probably have investments already, and you probably have a FIRE number in mind. Assume that you instead have $500k already invested, and with a SWR of 4%, your recurring spending makes a non-mortgage FIRE number of $1.5MM. We calculate our time to reach that using the NPER() method, and find that it will take us 8.6 years. Since we‚Äôve been paying down the mortgage over that time, we now calculate our remaining principal using the CUMPRINC() function:

    $400 000 + cumprinc(0.0425/12, 30*12, $400 000, 1, 8.6*12, 1) = $329 685
 
There are two sensible options once you reach this point - route your savings to paying off the mortgage in full, or save less and retire earlier by using the draw-down method. I'll also throw in the now obviously absurd SWR method, and a ""Simple Sum"" method for comparison which simply adds our current mortgage to our non-mortgage FIRE number. We calculate the additional money &amp; time needed for each method as before, and apply it to our original FIRE target to get final calculations:

    SWR Method:       $2.090 MM, 12.0 years
    Simple Sum:       $1.900 MM, 11.0 years
    Pay off in Full:  $1.829 MM, 10.6 years
    Draw-down Method: $1.761 MM, 10.2 years

By using a more realistic calculation for the invested assets required to cover our mortgage, we realize that we can retire **1.4 - 1.8 full years** earlier than expected! This is of course specific to this scenario that I made up, but [play around with the numbers for your own situation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7Y692E_Za0nqJRJJbkerAEdFrQ8ut0dZUqTSqcAwXg/edit?usp=sharing) and you should see just how significant a difference this makes.

One last thought - I played with a few different toy scenarios, and the benefit at FIRE of using the drawdown method over paying off your mortgage is only a few months in all of them. Fully paying off your primary home's mortgage is probably worth the reduction of risk for those extra few months of working.

## Notes ##

Assumptions I‚Äôm using here:

* You are not paying PMI because you put at least 20% down (though you could incorporate this by extending the methods presented here).
* You will stay in your house for your full duration of your mortgage.
* Your spending and savings are constant until you hit FIRE, and your spending remains constant thereafter.
* There are no market fluctuations. It would be good for someone to run this through an analysis to figure out what multiplier you need to add onto these results counteract sequence of returns risk. Just spitballing, add +20% if shooting for an exact number makes you nervous. 

Some more things to note:

* ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no way that I‚Äôm going to live in this house for 30 years!‚Äù No, you‚Äôre probably going to move a few times. But this method will give you an apples-to-apples comparison of how exactly your FIRE target will change when moving to a new house, and until then should give you an accurate estimate. And thinking it through, if you move to an equally priced home and your investment returns are higher than your mortgage interest, then the lowering of your mortgage payments due to the refresh of the 30 years means that the amount of investments you need allocated to your mortgage should *drop*. Maybe enough to cover closing costs?
* All spending/saving/FIRE numbers are in current-year real dollars. The mortgage payments are in nominal dollars. Market returns are after inflation. The calculations aren't quite apples-to-apples since the mortgage balance will devalue due to inflation over time in real terms. But this is a conservative approach, so consider it a safety factor - a more rigorous calculation would be crystal clear about nominal vs real terms and reach targets quicker.
* You should include non-mortgage housing costs such as insurance, taxes, upkeep, etc. in your monthly spending, since those will persist after you pay off the mortgage.
* Critiques very much welcome. :)",154.0,financialindependence

I made this post to explore this deeper and so we can have a discussion and learn together. Feel free to post anything about side hustles, regardless if I mention it below or not. 

**Popular side hustles** 

* Freelancing (programming, art, consulting, welding, etc)
* Tutoring 
* Working security at night 
* Bartending 
* Dog walking 
* Baby sitting 
* House sitting 
* Amazon FBA
* Property management 
* Online tech support 
* Uber/Lyft driving 
* Flipping things (cars, bikes, homes, etc)
* *If your side hustle isn‚Äôt mentioned, please share!*

**Misc questions**

* Do you report taxes on your side income? Do you legally have to?
* When should you set up a S-Corp or LLC for your side hustle? For example, let‚Äôs say I tutor and earn an additional $10k a year. What if I earned $20k or $30k?
* Which side hustles do you think generate the best $/hour? 
* Which side hustles do you think are most fun? 
* Some employment contracts stipulate that you cannot have another source of non-passive income. Do you just ignore this?
* Which side hustles are traps and not worth it?

Edit: for those that don‚Äôt think side hustles are worth it and time spent on a side hustle should instead be devoted toward your main job (OT, going for a promotion, getting certifications, etc.), please consider: 

* Not everyone‚Äôs job pays OT/has extra hours available or this just isn‚Äôt applicable. Think teacher, assistant, etc. 
* Sometimes promotions aren‚Äôt possible
* Not everyone is in love with their main job and people might want to do something different for diversity‚Äôs sake or for fun while earning some money. From u/sachin571

I recently read David Graeber's *Bullshit Jobs: A Theory* (2018) and came to the belated realisation that after more than a decade in the workforce, I‚Äôve really only had bullshit jobs. For those of you who aren‚Äôt familiar with the concept, here are some snippets from the book:

&gt; A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

&gt; Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They‚Äôre just pointless. Shit jobs are usually not at all bullshit; they typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society; it‚Äôs just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly.

&gt; ‚Ä¶ we have established three broad categories of jobs: useful jobs (which may or may not be shit jobs), bullshit jobs, and a small but ugly penumbra of jobs such as gangsters, slumlords, top corporate lawyers, or hedge fund CEOs, made up of people who are basically just selfish bastards and don‚Äôt really pretend to be anything else. The three-part list is not meant to be comprehensive. 

&gt; Those who work bullshit jobs are often surrounded by honor and prestige; they are respected as professionals, well paid, and treated as high achievers ‚Äì as the sort of people who can be justly proud of what they do. Yet secretly they are aware that they have achieved nothing; they feel they have done nothing to earn the consumer toys with which they fill their lives; they feel it‚Äôs all based on a lie ‚Äì as, indeed, it is.

See also Graeber‚Äôs [original essay](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs) on the subject.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve ever sought out bullshit jobs. Bullshit just came and found me. Over the years I tried a few different lines of work, even pursued lower paying public sector jobs in the hope of finding something worthwhile. They all turned out to be bullshit, the sort where I was just ticking a box or plagiarising someone else‚Äôs work for a report noone would read (‚Äúintellectual masturbation‚Äù). At this point in my career ‚Äì if you can even call it that ‚Äì I‚Äôve pretty much lost all hope that I will ever find a well-paying non-bullshit job. 

Of course I‚Äôm not saying that well-paying non-bullshit jobs don‚Äôt exist, just that statistically I‚Äôm not likely to get one. I suspect my jobs have been consistently bullshit partly because I don‚Äôt have any real specialist knowledge and skills (the knowledge to be a doctor, for example) and partly because I‚Äôve naturally gravitated to higher paying jobs (bullshit jobs tend to pay better than shit jobs). I also haven‚Äôt been driven enough to get a really high-powered  job (Graeber‚Äôs third category), the sort where you dispense with the pretense that you‚Äôre not a selfish bastard.

**My bullshit job**

I‚Äôm currently a risk analyst in a global financial institution. My job is ostensibly to produce risk reports for internal and external consumption but because of my employer‚Äôs conflicts of interests, I‚Äôm discouraged from doing any real analysis. I understand the existence of my job to serve two purposes: (1) to tick a box so that the organisation can say we‚Äôve analysed the risks, and (2) to increase the team‚Äôs headcount and thereby boost my bosses‚Äô standing in the organisation. It‚Äôs a classic bullshit job.

The downsides: 

* The organisation is highly hierarchical and I have little control over my work. Anything I write can be changed at any time by managers who have very little knowledge of the subject matter. This is obviously very frustrating and I now deal with it by putting minimal effort into any work. 

* The culture in my team is poisonous. Employees rarely get fired and generally don‚Äôt leave (on account of being overpaid) so there‚Äôs little chance the culture will improve. I‚Äôm sickened by the falseness and the relentless office politics.

* The job is 90% pointless. I‚Äôm a parasite on society and whatever skills I had in my field have atrophied. The perverse reality is that I would actually be more happy in my role if I didn‚Äôt have any related skills or knowledge, since then I wouldn‚Äôt know right from wrong.

The upside:

* By cutting corners, I‚Äôve managed to find carve out at least half of my work week for my own projects, mostly reading books and playing computer games at my desk. Thankfully I have my own office.

**FIRE**

My personal circumstance: in my mid-30s and married in Shanghai, China with two small children. We‚Äôve always tried to live frugally, although obviously many people in our city get by on much less. Our basic stats (in USD): 

* Income: $238k p.a. (75% is from my bullshit job)

* Spending: $46k p.a.

* Net worth: $1.6m, including $800k equities, $240k cash and fixed income, $1m real estate (no car, no other retirement accounts) and $440k debt (mostly home loan)

It looks like on paper we‚Äôre close to being able to FIRE but there are some important things holding us back:

* We‚Äôre fortunate in being able to keep expenses low living in Shanghai but I don‚Äôt imagine that this will continue indefinitely. I‚Äôm sure costs will increase as the kids grow up and we do plan to eventually move to a country with HCOL, e.g. UK, US, Australia. 

* I‚Äôm very concerned about future long-term returns given the current state of financial markets.

* We don‚Äôt yet have a concrete plan on what we‚Äôd do if we were to retire early. 

It occurs to me that my job (and other bullshit jobs) could be a potentially good way to reach FIRE, despite their many downsides. This is especially the case if my assumption is that any other job I‚Äôm likely to find will probably be bullshit as well. 

Anyone else currently in or been in a similar position? Would appreciate any thoughts or advice, thanks.

Edit 1: It‚Äôs heartening to hear that many others are in the same boat. And thanks to those who injected some much-needed perspective. For those in low-paying bullshit jobs or low-paying shit jobs, burdened with personal debt, I feel for you. To me, it all underscores the importance of FIRE, both as a journey (since it gives meaning to our daily struggles) and as an end goal (since it frees us from both shit and bullshit). 

I found the following replies especially insightful, as they go to the core of my and others' interest in FIRE:

u/CannonballUnder26:
&gt; I thought about this some more, and I gotta wonder, would anyone even bother with FIRE if it weren‚Äôt for bullshit jobs and neoliberalism? I don‚Äôt think many doctors and nurses pursue FIRE beyond just having an emergency fund and a safety net to catch themselves in lieu of a social welfare state. There aren‚Äôt many blue collar folks trying to get into RE, unless disability forces them to. I think this goes beyond a cultural difference, and is actually a manifestation of them recognizing their work has value, while ours does not.
These really are fundamentally tied phenomena, in my opinion. Many of us want to quit our soul sucking corporate bullshit jobs and focus on more purposeful work. ‚ÄúRE‚Äù isn‚Äôt usually about being an idle rich parasite for fifty years. It‚Äôs about freedom from bullshit. 

u/dlxw:
&gt; No one wants to stay in the ‚Äúshit job‚Äù layer where the actual work gets done, because true to its name your autonomy goes to shit, and then you start producing shit, and feeling like shit because of it. You try to get yourself out of it, and maybe you do some good work that stands on its own, but the more traction that work gets the more you get invited to the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù meeting and the more you realize all anyone is doing there is talking in circles spouting bullshit. But you‚Äôre comfortable and start getting paid more, and that just turns you into a bullshitter. The sad fact is that 95% of the human effort in that company gets devoted to coming up with bullshit strategies that create busywork for the shit layer, who is busy trying to ignore the bullshit and actually build and fix things. Then if you‚Äôre lucky, somewhere in the pipeline someone with a shit job, or a bullshitter who periodically descends into the shit layer to do some real work, is actually turning out good shit :) and that carries the whole company.

&gt; ‚Ä¶ When an entire economic model lionizes ‚Äúletting your money work for you‚Äù as a virtuous model of productivity, it stands to reason that the highest paid jobs closest to that faucet will revolve around legitimizing this system, creating the appearance of very difficult important work that is actually just moving some money and labor around between people who have shit jobs. You are an interface, a buffer between the true bastards and the people working shit jobs, creating the justification for extracting labor from the shit layer to hand profit to the bastards.

&gt; FIRE mentality can certainly become complicit in this (by basing an entire lifestyle around investment income) but I think the critical component is the work you will be free to do when you FIRE and no longer have to worry about the time investment of the bullshit job. I don‚Äôt see FIRE as a way to stop working; this world is too wonderful and broken to sit by doing nothing but subsisting on a pile of money. I *want* to work on useful things, which as he notes are often shit jobs, but with autonomy, where I am not just being crushed by bullshitters and only do the parts of the job I think are important. cleaning your neighborhood, caring for others, learning new skills like art, feeding people, raising kids, writing etc is all low paid shit work *when turned into jobs directed by bullshitters*, but i think is the most personally fulfilling thing I could do, and the actual work that would make society a better place. So my hope (we‚Äôll see how it goes) is to FIRE from my bullshit job and spend the time doing the work that actually makes life better.

Going forward I will probably do what u/LiveFastFiYoung does:
&gt; I spend maybe 15-20 hours a week on actual work, and spend the rest of the time in my workshop or writing. Those things keep me motivated and I dread having to send another pointless email that won't be read. I could likely go find another bullshit tech job that would pay slightly less that would have me working even less, but I guess I will coast until I can finally quit.

Edit 2: I just heard that David Graeber passed away yesterday, the same day as this post. *Bullshit jobs* was the last book he wrote. A great loss for the world to have lost such an original mind. RIP.",556.0,financialindependence

I'm positing that this is a valuable discussion topic because I've seen confusion on this sub about how Social Security works and whether or not you should even consider it in your FIRE plans. Given that many people here plan on retiring early, I think it's helpful to understand the eligibility requirements and mechanisms of the program.

**Disclaimer**: There are many contexts I'm not considering here, like teachers who pay into a pension system instead of Social Security. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone in the private sector in the US for their whole career. I'm not covering non-US citizens who have paid into Social Security or US citizens who worked abroad. Finally, I am not an expert, I'm just an internet stranger who has read a bit about the program. If I got something wrong, please correct me in the comments, we're all striving for a more perfect understanding.

# What is Social Security?

It's officially called **Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance**. For the purposes of this discussion, I'll focus on the old-age part. It is **not** a retirement vehicle where your individual contributions are placed for your later withdrawal, rather it functions more like a [QLAC (qualified longevity annuity contract)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_insurance), but with a strong tilt toward social safety net. It was officially signed into law in 1935 with an aim of reducing poverty among the elderly. 

From recent [CBPP research](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-keeps-22-million-americans-out-of-poverty-a-state-by-state) on Social Security and poverty:

> Without Social Security, the poverty rate for those aged 65 and over would meet or exceed 40 percent in one-third of states; with Social Security, it is less than 10 percent in two-thirds of states.

Alternatively an [excerpt from the PGPF](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2018/09/what-effect-does-social-security-have-on-poverty):

> Social Security drastically reduced poverty for the elderly. Without income from Social Security, two thirds of the elderly would be considered poor. Social Security reduced the poverty rate to 16 percent in 2008.


# How are benefits determined?

### Credits

To be eligible for Social Security you need a minimum of 40 ""credits"". As of 2020 you earn a credit for every $1,410 with a maximum of 4 credits per year. So if you make at least $5,640 / year (in today's dollars) for ten years then you're eligible. In keeping with the spirit of the program there's a low barrier to qualify for the most basic level of benefits.

### Averaged Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

Social Security keeps track of your eligible annual earnings. When calculating your benefits, they will count your top 35 years. If you've worked less than 35 years, you've got zeros counting against you. Past years earnings are adjusted for inflation by using multiplier values which the SSA [maintains a list](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/retirebenefit1.html) of.

Your AIME is then calculated by taking the adjusted total of those highest 35 years of earnings, dividing by 35, and then dividing by 12.

So if your total indexed earnings were $1,000,000 as of today, your AIME would be:
$1,000,000 / 35 / 12 = $2,380

### Income caps

Social Security places a cap on how much of your annual earnings count towards your AIME, in 2020 this cap is $137,700. It doesn't matter if you earn more, this is maximum value that will go into your earnings history for the year. That may sound unfair at first brush, but past this point you also stop paying Social Security taxes on income.

### Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

Now we get to the part people really care about, your AIME is translated into a PIA through a formula. PIA is what your monthly payment would be at full retirement age.

How does this formula work? You can read it from the source [here](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html). The short of it is that there are two bend points in the PIA curve, you can think of it as three brackets where each bracket gives you a worse return than its predecessor.

For AIME <= $960, you get 90% income replacement

For AIME > $960 and <= $5,785 you get 32% income replacement

For AIME > $5,785 you get 15% income replacement

---

This is where the social safety net behavior becomes most apparent, it's easy to qualify for the first $864 in monthly social security benefits since you get 90 cents on the dollar, but progressing beyond this is much slower going as you pass the first bend point and slower still when you hit the second bend point.

---

Let's run an example, carrying over our $2,380 AIME from earlier:

$960 * .9 = $864

$1,420 * .32 = $454

$0 * .15 = $0

= $1,318

This mean Social Security would pay you $1,318 a month at 67. There's a whole different calculation for starting benefits earlier or later which decreases or increases your payments, but I'll leave that for another discussion.

# RIP Social Security

### Isn't Social Security running out of money?

I hear this a lot. Invariably when Social Security comes up in the daily thread you'll see some people say they don't even count it because they don't think it'll be around when they retire. It's true that Social Security is paying out more money than it takes in but this is a [recent development](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v75n1/v75n1p1.html). Over the last few decades the program actually ran an overall surplus which went into a trust fund and was [invested into treasury securities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/policy-basics-understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds). That trust fund has $2.9 trillion dollars. 

You'll see [people say that Social Security went into a deficit in 2010](https://www.heritage.org/social-security/heritage-explains/the-state-social-security), which is true on a taxes in vs benefits out basis, but that ignores the interest income that Social Security receives from its invested trust fund assets. Up until 2020 or 2021, that interest income has been enough to make up the shortfall. Unfortunately this means Social Security is now starting to eat its nest egg.

Under current projections, the trust fund has enough money to [allow full payouts until 2034](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html). But what about after that, game over?

Not quite, if the trust fund is fully depleted, Social Security will only be able to pay out in benefits what it receives in taxes. As of right now, that's projected to be about 77 cents on the dollar. What that means is, if nothing else happens between now and trust fund depletion, you'll take a 23% haircut on your projected benefits. That's not great, but it's a far cry from the whole system imploding.

### No, seriously, I heard Social Security was going to explode

Every so often someone will write a [scary story](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/08/social-securitys-looming-32-trillion-shortfall.html) with obscenely large numbers. These are almost invariably based on the infinite horizon projections in the annual [Social Security trustees report](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2019/). 

The infinite horizon projection takes the 75 year projection and extends it into infinity. If this sounds like it might not produce sane numbers, [many actuaries agree with you](https://www.actuary.org/content/actuarial-perspective-2018-social-security-trustees-report-0):

> The infinite horizon projections project all annual balances beyond 75 years assuming that the current law, demographic assumptions, and economic trends from the 75-year projection continue indefinitely; in practice, this is highly problematic. Projections over an infinite time period have an extremely high degree of uncertainty. Troublesome inconsistencies can arise among demographic and program-specific assumptions. By assuming that longevity keeps increasing forever while retirement ages remain static, for example, the infinite time period forecast will eventually result in an extremely long period of retirement.

# What's FIRE got to do with it?

That was all interesting, but what are the takeaways for someone interested in FIRE? 

### Make sure you're eligible

First and foremost, get those 40 credits! Unless you strike it very rich early on, it's a good hedge to make sure you're eligible for at least the basic levels of Social Security benefits. You're hopefully looking at a long retirement and these payments may help considerably twenty or thirty years down the line.

### Max out the first segment of the PIA curve

If you work for at least ten years and make >= $40k / year, you'll both qualify for Social Security benefits and fill up the first (and most generous) part of the PIA curve. For most people here it'll probably just happen as a matter of course.

### Be realistic about Social Security

It's extremely conservative to entirely exclude Social Security from your plans. Pricing in a haircut seems prudent. Even if political action is taken to shore up finances, it may have the same net effect to a well-off FIRE person (i.e. heavier taxation of benefits, means testing, etc). I'd be wary of simply taking the stated monthly benefits you see now at face value if your benefits are more than 10 years out.

### A couple of naive strategies

Here are two different ways I've thought of Social Security over the years in my plans. I'm not presenting these as recommendations or fully formed plans, but providing them as an example.

##### Safe withdrawal rate

Goal: Boost your starting SWR by accounting for your eventual Social Security benefits

ERN has an [interesting write-up](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/) that discusses accounting for Social Security cash flows when planning your safe withdrawal rate. Admittedly he does not think it changes much for very early retirees, but depending on when you retire and what your expected benefits are, Social Security can have a non-trivial impact on your SWR.

##### Longevity insurance

Goal: Guard against an unexpectedly long life

In this scenario you're mostly planning on your own funds to see you through your early retirement, and you want to maximize the cash flow from Social Security in the event that you somehow live to 90 or beyond. In this case you'd want to defer your benefits as long as possible (70 years old) to increase the monthly benefit. The downside to this approach is that if you don't live that long (say you keel over at 75), you've made a sub optimal choice with regard to total payout. In the context of insurance though, this is could be a fair trade-off. A QLAC or deferred annuity is a more straightforward proposition for such hedging but for most people Social Security is mandatory anyway.

### Be aware of your progress

You can check on your current credits, AIME and PIA by plugging your numbers into [https://ssa.tools/](https://ssa.tools/). I've got no connection with this page, I just think its a nifty tool. You can get your numbers by signing into your [ssa.gov account](https://www.ssa.gov/). 

**Note**: If you're just signing up for an ssa.gov account, be aware that they need to pull your credit information from Equifax to verify your identity, so if you've frozen your credit with Equifax, you'll actually have to do a temporary lift before applying. Yes, everything about that last sentence is ridiculous.

From their [account creation page](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/create.html):

> If you have a security freeze, fraud alert, or both on your credit report, you can still open a my Social Security account by temporarily lifting it.

### Spousal benefits

Another fun tip is that if you're married and your partner has a much lower income and / or becomes a stay at home parent, you can look into [spousal benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/applying6.html). This lets your partner receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of your own regardless of their work record. Obviously you'd want to crunch the numbers to see if your partner is eligible for a larger benefit based on their own earnings history.

### Retiring abroad

Retiring abroad is a common theme amongst a certain segment of the FIRE population. 

SSA provides a [full page](https://www.ssa.gov/international/payments.html) of information regarding receiving payments while outside the US. The short answer is that if you're a US citizen who is eligible for benefits, you should be able to get your payments regardless of where you live, so long as that where isn't North Korea or Cuba. They even provide a [guided questionnaire](https://www.ssa.gov/international/payments_outsideUS.html) to help you determine if payments will work in your specific situation.

# Conclusion

At the end of the day, Social Security is a safety net more than it is a retirement mechanism. Its goal is to help cash strapped seniors make ends meet, not support a great or even good retirement on its own. For many people here, however, it represents a non-trivial cash flow on the back end of their retirement and it shouldn't be dismissed lightly. 

Don't assume Social Security will look or pay the same 30 years from now. On the flip side there would be objectively bad outcomes for a significant portion of the elderly population if it went belly up. I could be wrong, but I don't think eliminating Social Security would be a popular political agenda.

That's about as long a wall of text as I am willing to write, and probably longer than most people are willing to read. For those of you that did read it through, I hope it helped.",329.0,financialindependence

We could reach $250-300k for that down payment over the next 4-5 years, but part of me wonders whether we should just plan to rent forever, invest in index funds, and if there's a good opportunity 5+ years down the line, we can buy a home then.

At the same time, we do have a goal of retiring early, and we're not sure what path to take that will get us there. Or perhaps we could rent until early retirement, and settle down in a cheaper area.

Wanted to share my tale, as I love reading success stories and my journey has some twist and turns. Some details are obfuscated to protect my innocence :) 

### Some Background
2004 - Start in internship (during transition between High School and College) with a large defense contractor. My salary for an intern is great ($18/hr) and I'm given retirement benefits. Immediately start sinking 25% into my 401k.

2008 - Graduate college with a degree in Engineering. The job market sucks, and I take a few months off to backpack around Europe and Africa.

2009 - Come back to my HCOL city and start working as a government contractor. Salary is $55k. I'm fortunate to have the option to live with my folks so I can save up. 

2010 - Switch job/company for a new salary of $63k.

2011 - Internal job change to $68k. 

2012  - Switch job/company to $80k.

2013 - Buy a 1 BR cooperative in in the downtown area. The building is old, and the coop fees are high, but I love the location and the neighborhood. $229k purchase price with 20% down @ 3.75% interest nets me a mortgage at roughly $850/mo. All cooperative fees + additional costs add roughly the same, for a total monthly payment of $1700. 

2014 - Internal job switch. Base salary stays the same, but I get ~$20k in commission, bringing my total to ~$110k. Get married. Luckily decide to keep our finances completely separate, which was a great idea, because...

2015 - Get divorced. I decide to take a sabbatical in Q4; what was intended as 1 year off balloons into 2 years. I spend a year camping through Africa, 6 months in the Indian subcontinent, and 6 months thru-hiking the Appalachian trail. These were the best 2 years of my life. Total cost abroad for the 2 years was around 40k. When I return, I find that my NW is about the same as when I left. 

2018 - Find a new job with a salary of $132k. My two year sabbatical, surprisingly, does not seem to be an issue at all.

2019 - Find a new job with an F500 company. Lower base salary, but new company allows me to do mega backdoor roth, and there are stock incentives. Total cash comp ~135k. Over the next ~18 months, my company 401k is over 100k.

2020 - Get fired; with COVID happening decide to join a family member for a ~3 month camping road trip out west. Think a lot about what I want my life to look like, and how I can build that life. 

### Where I'm at now
* Mortgage down to ~$156k. With appreciation, my place is now worth around ~375k. (Have not refinanced, still at 3.75%. Coop fee is now almost exactly $1k/month, but this is my ""all in"" cost - includes all utilities, taxes, insurance, etc.)
* 205k in Betterment @ 100% stocks in default allocation
* 200k in an IRA @ 100% stocks
* 140k in a Roth IRA @ 100% stocks (I took serious advantage of the megabackdoor roth with my two years available)
* 13k in a solo 401k
* 6k in an HSA (invested)
* ~20k sitting in cash (for now)

### My Living Expenses
I don't do a super good job tracking living expenses, but I live a fairly simple life. My main hobbies are weightlifting, bike riding, and reading. My total household costs are roughly:

* $1850/month housing
* $250/month food
* $30/month cell phone bill
* $30/month transportation (bike share + public transit; no car) 
* $45/month gym membership
* $300/month everything else (hangouts with friends, apartment stuff, clothes, etc.) 

At my current salary, I'm able to comfortably save between $5k-6k a month. 

### Back to the story...
While on the road with my brother (this is over the summer, Jul - Sep 2020), I find two candidate companies and take interviews from hotel rooms in between camping under the stars. I'm trying to figure out how to best balance my love for the outdoors with ""professional"" jobs that allow a couple weeks off, at best. I know I don't want to go back to working full time, but I don't really know how to go about navigating the situation.

I take one final round interview, which goes really well. This is how the conversation goes:

> Boss: OK, cool, the interview is over. That went well. We want to hire you.
> 
> Me: ...Huh, what? You've decided already?
> 
> Boss: Yeah, let's talk about what that looks like, if you want to work here.
> 
> Me: ....Uh...yeah, sure. I mean, the company sounds awesome, but I'm not sure it would work out...
> 
> Boss: Oh, why not?
> 
> Me: Well....I don't think I want to work 12 months a year.
> 
> Boss: OK. Not everyone here works full time. What do you mean, you don't want to work 12 months a year? How often do you want to work?
> 
> Me: Uhh....I'm not sure? Maybe 6 months on, 6 months off? (I could feel my sphincter tighten up as I asked for this. I was totally unprepared for this conversation!)
> 
> Boss: ......We can accommodate that. Any other big issues?

I was shocked how easy it was! There was almost no push back, and no negotiations on my desire to work only 6 months a year. Luckily, I work as a consultant where projects are typically 6-9 months long, so this ask isn't as crazy as it sounds. We spent some time negotiating what the offer looked like, considering the unusual circumstances, and we settled at $75/hr 1099. 

### What the Future Looks Like
I'm super excited to have the flexibility to travel six months a year, and I know intellectually I shouldn't need to save any additional money to retire at ~60. I'm also extremely fortunate to work in a field where I love going into work every day. I plan on doing a lot more ""long hikes"" - the Pacific Crest Trail, the Te Aroroa, some hikes in Europe - as well as more backpacking/camping trips. 

In terms of finances, I should bring in 12.5k a month * 6 months = $75k. I haven't run all the numbers, but as a 1099 I should be able to shelter a ton of money from the IRS:

* $19.5k 401k
* $~12k 401k (""company"" match)
* $3.5 k HSA + ~3.6k in health care costs (Bronze Plan as a Single person)
* $6k IRA
* $~12k (20% passthrough as a sole prop)

So self employment tax notwithstanding, my federal and state taxes should be quite low.

### The Elephant in the Room - My Apartment
Every time I run the numbers, paying nearly 2 grand a month for my apartment seems crazy, especially if I only plan in living in it 6 months a year. Unfortunately my HOA rules do *not* allow renters for terms under one year. 

Another option I've considered is selling my apartment, and using the proceeds to either pay all cash for a place in a lower COL (Las Vegas? Charlotte?) and never worry about a mortgage again, or possibly try the digital nomad life for a year or two. 

In the short term, I think I'm OK holding it. When I travel overseas, I usually travel quite cheaply - either camping or staying in hostels, eating street food, walking around a lot, things like that. Even if my annual expenses balloon a bit, I would feel very comfortable pulling ~10k/year (5%) from my Betterment account to cover the delta. The other option, of course, is to work 8 or 9 months a year for a couple years if I'm drawing down my Betterment account too fast. 

### Wrap Up
I've been super fortunate with my life, and I'm really excited to see how the next phase unfolds. Please let me know what you think!

### EDIT - FOLLOW-UP Q+A
*Q: You had help!*

A: Yes, I thought it was so blindingly obvious that I didn't get here alone that I wasn't super explicit about that. I thought the most interesting part about this post was my desire to go half time, and how that unfolded, but I see in retrospect adding in numbers makes everyone wants to run their own calculation.

*Q: What help did you get?*

A: **My grandmother died in early 2019 and left me ~$70k.** This *absolutely* impacted my decision and probably moved my decision up 12-15 months. College was paid for. Leveraging family connections to get my first internship. I also kept about ~10k in cash wedding gifts even after the divorce, but that was mainly out of spite, so let's not dwell on it :)

*Q: The numbers still don't make sense!*

A: Technically that's not a question, but yes, they do. I'm not sure where some of the commenters were getting an ""estimated NW of 300k running the numbers"", but here's a more granular breakdown. These are estimates, I don't have everything tracked super well. 

Years | Yearly Cash Savings | Total Cash Savings | S&P Index Then | Equivalent $ Now | How?
---|---|----|----|----|----
2004 - 2007 | $4k | $16k | ~1300 | ~40k | Interns were eligible for 401 (+match). I took advantage of this, heavily. I also worked during winter break, so it was more than just 3 months/year.
2009 - 2012 | $25k | $100k  | ~1300 | ~250k  | I was living at home, with my folks. Expenses were close to zero. My savings rate some years was probably over 80%. $25k/year is lower than I saved, I excluded the ~12.5k/year * 4 years that went towards my down payment.
2013 - 2015 | $40k | $120k | ~2000 | ~200k | By 2014 I cross into 6 figures, these savings rates are not that impressive
2018 - 2019 | $60k | $120k | ~2800 | ~140k | Megabackdoor Roth, primarily.

Total ""stock equivalent"" savings = 40k + 250k + 200k + 140k + 70k (from grandma) = $700k in stocks. My actual holdings are less. The lion's share of this delta is when I pulled out $40k between 2015 - 2017 to fund my sabbatical, which has a total ""cost"", with gains, of closer to $65. (I also pulled out smaller amounts throughout the years for other trips.) 

*Q: There's an error in your math!*

A: Yeah, probably. It's not intentional.

*Q: It's impossible to buy a house for $230k in a HCOL!""*

A: I agree that it's probably impossible to buy an apartment in 2020 in a HCOL for $230k. I bought in 2013, and I technically didn't buy an apartment, I bought a cooperative. These are similar, but coops are typically more depressed in value than apartments because of restrictions. I also bought in what was a lower income, more racially diverse area, so gentrification (and therefore house prices) hadn't quite caught up. But yeah, I got an absolute steal of a deal, if I do say so myself. 

*Q: So you took 2 years off, spent about $40k, and when you came back, your net worth was about the same? Please, explain the magic of compound interest!*

A: For sure, my dude! I *think* I had about $350k invested in the market about that time. I pulled out about $40k, leaving me $310k. My sabbatical was almost exactly 2 years, Nov 2015 - Nov 2017. In Nov 2015, the S&P index was at ~2020. When I came back in Nov 2017, the S&P was ~2600. That's about a 30% gain. (350 - 40) + 30% > 350. Go, compound interest! (This excludes the ~8k I gained in NW by renters paying down my mortgage for me.)

I have a new chapter in my story.

NW:  $1.6M
Age:  43
Married with one child

Back story:  six months ago I received a glowing letter from my immediate supervisor on how well I was performing.  All the metrics the admin types look at, I was doing extremely well.  Had a good working relationship with my coworkers too.  Was extremely happy at the time.

Fast forward five weeks:  we have a facility closure in my region.  I am not being laid off but asked to relocate.  It felt like a gut punch and was without question a step down.  They told me they would keep me in my current role for another three months, despite being overstaffed, ‚Äúas a courtesy‚Äù.  

In time I was given some schedules and assignments on my way out that seemed punitive and were unacceptable to me.  

How I would have handled this if I didn‚Äôt have decent savings:  Tuck my tail between my legs and keep working

How I handled it given my current situation:  I got confrontational.  I told them this was unacceptable.  I provided ample evidence my peers were not given such assignments/schedule in short time.  I demanded them to make some changes.  They refused.  I resigned abruptly and told them to find someone else to do their grunt work.

Three months later, I have started my own business and found flexible side work I can do from home as I grow the business.  New business has been a bit slow to take off admittedly but we are progressing and increasing our marketing strategies.  I wish I could be more specific but it would potentially reveal my identity.

My income is right now a fraction of what it was before, but growing week to week.  I did have a moment or two after I was in the early stages of my new career path where I briefly felt panic.  But mostly that has not been an issue.

What has gotten me through those occasional moments:  reminding myself that my entire career thus far, saving aggressively for a number of years, was in order to help me in a moment like this.  Coming to that realization, I was able to accept the short term drop in income.  I recognized that if I let stress eat me up during this time then my entire career saving for the future has accomplished nothing.

So today ironically I spend zero time stressing about money.  Month to month when my income was an order of magnitude higher I was far more meticulous about it all.  I have given myself permission to relax and focus on the next chapter.  And it feels great.

Today I work on my own terms.  My side gig is enough to support my family month to month and my new business if it takes off will be more lucrative.  I still have a lot to accomplish but today I believe in myself and I believe I will look back on my last job and the way things went south as a blessing.",105.0,financialindependence

I had previously taken a more qualitative look at it ([HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ajp2y4/market_valuation_and_its_effects_on_the_safe)),  but I wanted to expand on the idea and actually see if it were possible to formulate a SWR forecast. Links to the paper are listed below. 

[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yO0K96Iyc09ihjk8f6j-yZizVGVJDCvw/view?usp=sharing)

[Excel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n8suK1EdGLvpuXJ_JtKRx9cF4rO0VrO/view?usp=sharing)

In the paper, I shared my methodology as well as proposed a variable withdrawal strategy based on this new valuation approach. 

I think it's worth the read (and it's not very long with lots of pictures), but I'll share some of the findings below. 



**Quick Intro**

I calculated the actual SWR for every year from 1928 to 1990. I compiled these SWR's along with the CAPE (Shiller PE) and 10 year treasury yield for each starting period, and performed a linear regression analysis on the data. The resulting equation showed good correlation (R^2 = 0.72). Refer to the paper for more details on the methodology. 

All data in the study is for a 70/30 portfolio.



**Findings**

The 95% confidence formula for SWR based on this valuation approach is as follows:

SWR_predicted = 0.55597 √ó (Implied Yield) + 0.11051 √ó (Spread) + 0.0082319

where, 

Implied Yield = 0.7 √ó (1/CAPE) + 0.3 √ó (Treasury Yield)

Spread = 1/CAPE - (Treasury Yield)



**Variable Withdrawal Method**

In the paper, I looked at one way to implement this valuation approach and compared it to the trinity study. The basis was simply withdraw the amount based on the predicted SWR and portfolio value at the start of each year. I set a withdrawal floor at the minimum of 40k or the 1st years withdrawal amount. Setting a floor is important from a practical sense as any methodology that could leave you withdrawing at the poverty level isn't very useful. 

Performing a back test, this method never failed in any 30 year period, and also reduces the likelihood of massive portfolio expansion like trinity study has in the past (1980's for example). Withdrawals taken from year to year are also relatively smooth with the variable approach. 

In the paper, I shared portfolio performance and withdrawal summaries for some interesting years: 1929, 1966, 1982, 2000.



**Current State of Affairs**

To kick off 2021, the current projected SWR is projected to be between 2.35% - 4.81% (likely a little higher after this morning). The lower bound of 2.35% ties the year 2000 as the lowest predicted SWR of all years in this study.

And rightly so.  Wouldn't it be incredible to never have to work again?  Work sucks, right?

I just wanted to offer my perspective.

I'm from a FAIRLY wealthy family, and by that, I mean wealthy enough to support me at a low-level income without my really working.  I have never been afraid to quit a job, because my family is always there to catch me.  I don't pay rent currently, because I live in an apartment that is owned by my family.  My jobs usually don't last very long, and I am able to go for long stretches between them without working.

Even as I'm writing this, it sounds pretty nice, but the truth is actually a lot dimmer.  I struggle constantly with insecurity, and I haven't been able to hang onto a relationship for more than a few months.  I'm always searching for purpose, because my life seems meaningless at times.  I spend a lot of my days acting out on addictions, just trying to get away from the feeling that I am wasting my life.  I don't HAVE to create anything productive, I don't HAVE to add value to the world... so why do it?  I feel insecure about my place in this world, because I haven't really earned it yet.

I'm not saying to stay in a job you hate, or that reaching for FIRE is a bad goal... but being financially independent, retiring early, not having to work... none of those things in themselves will make you happy.  You will just have a different set of problems to deal with.

I hope this doesn't offend anybody here.  I wish you the best of luck on your goals, and I hope your financial dreams come true.

177,Did free cash drive people to quit work? Not according to a new study of Ontario‚Äôs basic income experiment,,871.0,fe26z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fe26z3/did_free_cash_drive_people_to_quit_work_not/,1583442740.0,"https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/gta/2020/03/04/did-free-cash-drive-people-to-quit-work-not-according-to-a-new-study-of-ontarios-basic-income-experiment.html



I posted this article because I feel like it parallels one of the main benefits of FI ‚Äì More freedom to pursue jobs and activities that you deem as higher value.

 

To briefly summarize, there was a pilot project in Ontario that saw roughly 4000 people receive universal basic incomes (UBI) over the course of 13-17 months.  It would have been a 3-year study, but the provincial government decided to scrap the program half-way through.  So take the results with a grain of salt.  That said, the items that stuck out as most interesting were that:

 

1. Three quarters of people continued to work while receiving UBI.  

What does this tell us?  It could mean that these people derived value other than money from their jobs.  However, I'd say it's difficult to definitively conclude that since participants were aware that this was a short-term study and that after 3 years, the UBI would stop.  Work would be necessary for them once the UBI stopped, and if they quit their jobs now, they'd be three years ""behind"" in their savings/careers.  The amount of UBI paid (generally $17k CAD /year per person, $24k CAD /year for couples) may have also been a factor as to why most participants continued to work.
 
 
2. Of the three quarters of people who continued to work, more than one third were able to move to higher paying and more secure jobs.  

This to me is the most telling.  It seems like these people were able to take more risks in their jobs to move to better positions, or were able to leave precarious/toxic jobs and move onto something better.  Anecdotal accounts of that are within the article.  I think this is the point that mirrors FI the most.  Without having to worry about your next paycheque as much, you have more freedom to explore your ""highest and best use"", or at least find better employment.  You're no longer beholden to a bad job.  I've seen members on this subreddit express the same sentiments ‚Äì freedom to find better employment since money is no longer an incumbrance.
 

I'd be curious to get people's views on this article, or UBI in general.  How would UBI impact FIRE, if at all?",352.0,financialindependence

Many folks here probably do that already, but it's not as common as I expected. We have a lot of discussion in the daily threads about guilty pleasures, purchases that are/aren't worth it, the value of vacations, and so forth.

I grew up, ""we can definitely buy food but we if the car breaks again we'll lose the house,"" lower-middle class. For my early adult years, I experienced intense guilt whenever I made any kind of purchase. Surprisingly, this didn't go away once I broke into earning six figures. Non-stop buyers' remorse, even over good purchases. The guilt of a $30 brunch negated any enjoyment of such a luxury.

**Eventually, I created a checking account exclusively for guilt-free spending.** Every paycheck, I automatically put $X into it. When I got raises, I would funnel 80% of the raise into savings/investment accounts and 20% into the lifestyle/fun-money account. Managed lifestyle creep.

Now, I feel zero guilt when I buy things from that account. It's factored into my FIRE plan, after all. It's part of the budget, just like vanguard, just like monthly bills. Fancy cocktails? Zero guilt. New phone? Gravy. All-inclusive vacation with my wife? If the account stays > $0, we could afford it.

185,My Mega Backdoor Roth setup experience with Fidelity,,841.0,f2kgq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f2kgq1/my_mega_backdoor_roth_setup_experience_with/,1581477076.0,"Me and my wife make more than 200k$ a year, so we don't qualify to contribute to Roth IRA. We were basically maxing out 401ks then sending everything else to our taxable Vanguard account.

I was always curious about the Mega backdoor Roth i.e a way for high income individuals/couples to contribute money to Roth so that it can grow tax free. Today I finally had time to research if my company offered this (thankfully they do!) and I set it up with Fidelity. I learnt a few things so I thought I'd share my experience with you guys:

Fidelity doesn't let anyone set this rollover on their own via their website etc. You need to call them to make any kind of change to your after tax contributions' rollovers. There are two ways of doing this.

1. You will have an after tax contribution option in your Fidelity account, if your employer allows you to contribute to after tax. You can contribute to this after tax, then call Fidelity periodically and ask them to move this your Roth at any time you want. IRS limits your pre tax contributions(19,500) + employer contributions + after tax contributions to 57k. So you can contribute (57k - 19.5k - employer contributions) as after tax contributions.

2. The problem with option 1 is that, any growth/dividend accumulated in the period between after tax contribution and the time you call Fidelity to roll it into your Roth 401k is taxable. Also calling them each time is a chore. To avoid this, you can call Fidelity to setup any after tax contributions to automatically be rolled over to your Roth 401k immediately, so that the gains are not taxed. The official term for this is ""automatic roth in-plan conversion""


EDIT: Adding/editing a few things I learned from this thread, for the year 2020:

1. I mistakenly assumed that my only option was the mega backdoor roth after maxing out my 401k, due to income limits. You can also open a traditional IRA, contribute 6k to it, then convert this to a Roth IRA - provided you don't have any other IRA. This is called backdoor Roth and can be done by anyone irrespective of employer. On top of this, if employers allow, you can do the mega backdoor roth which is what this post is about. So this brings the total tax advantaged contribution amount possible to 57k(pre+post tax via 401k) + 6k (via traditional IRA to Roth backdoor) + 3550 (HSA)

2. You can rollover your after tax 401k megabackdoor contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401k. Looks like rolling over to Roth IRA can to be done only manually each time. Rolling over to Roth 401k can be done automatically, if that is part of your employer's plan offering. The advantage of rolling over to Roth IRA is that you can access the contributions any time. You can only access the contributions from the Roth 401k when you leave your employer. In either case, accessing the contributions are tax free. In either case, accessing the gains will be tax/penalty free only by age 59.5. Before that, to access gains, you have to pay tax + penalty.

She gets money from a few sources, including a weekly allowance, gifts from relatives, and a small amount from working in my business. I require her to save 30% of everything she receives, which goes into her savings account. I show her how the account is growing, and I told her that once it gets to $3,000, she can invest it in the stock market (mutual fund).

Still, I'm not sure that this is making any sense to her. Does anyone have any success or failure stories when it came to teaching your now-grown children about money?

&#x200B;

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your advice, experience, anecdotes, snarky replies and funny stories! After reading every comment, these are the takeaways that will shape my next steps:

&#x200B;

1. Some people (or their kids) ""got it"" (saving and investing) at a young age - like kindergarten. Others got it in their 20s or later. Some said their kids still haven't gotten it. I conclude that, for my daughter, investing for the long term is probably too abstract at her age.
2. A LOT of you gave incentives/were incentivized to save (e.g. like matching savings) and make money (chores or jobs). There were a couple examples of the bucket system and games. One person mentioned charity. Great idea.
3. Many of you taught or learned through example, and said kids are ""always watching"" even if it isn't readily understood at the time. Not just finance stuff.
4. It is better to teach than to not teach. There is a risk of backfiring or it may not have any effect at all, but many wished their parents had guided them when they were young.
5. On a technical note, some questioned the $3k investing threshold. I was still stuck in the Vanguard minimums. When the time comes, we'll look at ETFs.
6. There are a lot of resources for teaching kids about money. Books and YouTube.

Given the above, I've decided that first I'm going to show her how to budget the money she has and will be receiving in the near future (like allowance). Investing was just putting the cart before the horse so to speak. I talked to her about budgeting yesterday, and she showed me a note she keeps on her phone. It lists her current savings and money coming in. So that was good. I'm also going to kill two birds with one stone and show her how to use Google Sheets. Will be good to keep track but also to teach her about spreadsheets in general (not just for finance). She's also focused on saving up for a new phone,  so that can ""anchor"" the lesson. 

Next, I'm going give her some incentives for saving. Not sure exactly what yet, but something like matching 50% of the savings she's accumulated by each birthday (Initially I wanted 100% but my wife laughed and said that by high school we might owe her all of our money lol).

Finally, I need to be a bit more aware of my own habits. There were a couple times when she didn't have any money with her and I had to loan her $5 or so until the end of the day. I'm going to stop doing that for the most part. Also, I owe her some money for gift cards that I bought from her, but I've been letting it float for too long. Kids are watching, right?

Actually just a couple more things about what I ""read into"" many comments. There is a LOT of love (sometimes tough love) passed from parents to their kids through money lessons. Parents have done what they can, but also stressed that kids need the freedom to make their own mistakes. Hearing all these stories was very encouraging. Kudos to the FI community!

I kinda took offense of that notion in the past. I thought to myself that if I save enough to encounter 10% vacancy, have a healthy reserve, I should be OK. Who would knew this Pandemic just threw all of these conventional RE wisdom in the trash.

A huge part of my post FIRE income would have come from my real estate investments. It's totally rocky right now with very uncertain future due to the shutdown. But I am still hoping for the best.

I did take this sub's recommendation and built a pretty sizable Cash/Bonds/Stocks mix. FireCalc showed that I have a 98% success rate to live off that stash for 20 years without any additional income.  I am in my early 40's. And yes, I am counting on some SS and a sizable ""inheritance"" (It's a house I bought for my parents in the 90's. It's paid off. I still own it.)

Since this pandemic, I took an unpaid leave from my job and it suppose to end after 3 months. It has been 6 weeks without any work and I am feeling the best!!!

I don‚Äôt have to do the stupid daily stand up to report to the higher being what I have been up to.  No more nagging emails from HR, my boss, compliance and IT department. ZERO stress!

The dreadful feeling that eventually I still have to return to work really puts me down. If only if I could count on my RE investment, I would have pulled the trigger with no hesitation.

Some FIRE folks said that it doesn't have to be 0% or 100%. Deep down, I really want to just take a chance. I am good for 20 years at least using my savings. My real estate income didn‚Äôt go down to 0 even in this hellish climate.

188,On the Road to Achieving FI while making 66K,,819.0,hcuh9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hcuh9e/on_the_road_to_achieving_fi_while_making_66k/,1592689790.0,"Hello, all! 

I shared a post yesterday where I talked about hitting a milestone of maxing out 403B and getting my rental property self-sustaining all while making 65-66K per year and coming from an underprivileged background. 

I received a lot of DMs asking for specific details & insight so I thought I would share it in a post. (The mods removed the original post because it was a milestone better suited for a milestone thread). 

&#x200B;

Background:

I‚Äôm currently a 29F. I was born in India & moved to the US with my family when I was 5. My dad immigrated on a work-visa in the late 80s & worked in a convenience store, as a dishwasher, and a check-out clerk to provide for us. He & my mom got a loan to buy a small motel in rural OK when I was 6. They were making enough to pay bills, but not really saving. We then moved to Texas where they bought a bigger property (again with a huge loan this time from the SBA). They were able to save a little this time, but that was wiped out when the Great Recession hit. I graduated HS in 2008 & really had no idea how I would make it through college. My school was a rural school and we didn't have a guidance counselor. Most of the teachers expected us to not go to college. Somehow, using the internet, I figured it out and went to a state university. I worked during college (sometimes as many as 3 jobs) and graduated without loans. 

&#x200B;

Income & Investments:

After I graduated, I began working in education. I love the field & the impact education can have on lives. I love the field, but it doesn‚Äôt pay well. I‚Äôve been working for 8 years, but only started to make over 60K in the last three. I have worked in many aspects of education including K-12, non-profits, and now higher ed. Some of the orgs had 403bs and matching, but not all. My current org gives us 10% (5% base, 5% match). 

I basically taught myself about personal finance using the pf subreddit. My family didn‚Äôt really discuss personal finance as my parents were just focused on keeping their business running so I was starting at level zero. I didn‚Äôt know much from 2012-2014 expect that I wanted to eventually get an MBA so I was just saving cash for that. 

I just lived way below my means in a tiny studio and was focused on saving as much as cash as I could. I also got my first credit card in 2015- a BofA travel rewards card! Before, I used to pay for everything with a debit card lol. 

In 2015, I started a Roth IRA and have maxed it out every year. All in low-cost index funds using the Bogle method. 

In 2016, I started my MBA at another state school. I went part-time while working full-time so it took 3 years. It cost about 30K in all, but I was able to pay in cash installments every semester. 

In 2017, I became the Executive Director of a local non-profit and my pay was $62K, but it included no retirement or health insurance. I paid for health insurance out of pocket, maxed out my Roth IRA and put a lot of other cash into a taxable brokerage account still investing in low-cost index funds. 

I also bought a house at this time. I‚Äôd never lived in a house before! I put 5% down even thought I could have put more & I‚Äôm glad I did.  I also put into my closing contract for the seller to pay 5K of the closing costs and they did! So, my cash to close was something like 3K. Crazy! 

At that time, 62K seemed like a jackpot for me! My take-home pay was around 4K and that just seemed like a LOT of money (still does tbh). I just saved most of it. 

In 2019, I moved across the country to begin working at a university. My salary is now 66K. The org gives us 10% in a 403b as well as really good health insurance. The 403b is invested in low-cost Vangaurd index funds as well. 

One of my goals this year was to max out my 403B (19,500). I wanted to first hit 6 months‚Äô worth of expenses in my Efund and at least 15K in my house fund so I continued to stock away money. I put my tax refunds, stimulus, any extra cash into these accounts. I also stuck by a budget (but I definitely treat myself!). I had about 7K in my home fund in February and I swear once I became laser focused on growing this, different income streams opened up. I started a small side-hustle mentoring & coaching high school student and then I started an online conference business during the pandemic whilst working from home. 

I also finally increased my contributions enough to max out my 403b!

I was renting out my house as an Airbnb but decided to make the shift to long-term lease in April. My Airbnb manager was great, and she & a few other local contacts did some on the ground stuff for me, while I worked on marketing the property. I was initially going to go with a property manager but was barely going to break even with their 10% fees. So, I decided to DIY (and found a great online resource to help manage things ([Avail.co](https://Avail.co))). 

I just found some renters last week who signed the lease, paid their deposit & first month‚Äôs rent & move in soon! I had a very thorough vetting process which is why my place took a little longer to rent, but it was 100% worth it. I did all the research myself using website like [Avail.co](https://Avail.co) & Bigger Pockets. 

I also worked with a great tax accountant to got me the full benefit of active loss clause for small-time landlords (folks who make under a 100K can get a 25K loss benefit to their W-2 income). Since, my rental income was a net loss esp including depreciation, I was able to have my MAGI lowered by the amount of my loss. That helped at tax time. 

&#x200B;

Keeping my expenses low has been mostly easy. I‚Äôm a pretty relaxed person. All of my hobbies are free. Literally, my favorite things to do are go on walks with my dogs and read books in my hammock. I enjoy travelling too, but obviously that‚Äôs on a pause right now. 

&#x200B;

Future Goals:

My future goals are 

1)	Continue maxing out my 403B

2)	Move into a director level role at my org or a similar org (ideally making 100K+ and ideally being remote)

3)	Buy rental property in cash (maybe‚ÄîI want to see how like being a landlord!)

4)	Continue really liking my work (very important to me)

5)	Make an impact for others (I‚Äôd like to financially support girls‚Äô education)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyways, I hope this answers some specific questions people had! I‚Äôm happy to share ÔÅä

&#x200B;

TLDR:

I have never made more than 66K and I‚Äôm sharing my journey on how I was able to max out my 403B, rent out a property and more.",110.0,financialindependence

190,My (Delayed) FIRE Journey,,824.0,jfzqps,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jfzqps/my_delayed_fire_journey/,1603373751.0,"TLDR ‚Äì Unmotivated kid that barely made it out of high school, joins the military, gets educated, and travels the world as a Corporate cog before retiring comfortably at 54.

 
A lot of the posts here seem to follow a common pattern:  Young person gets a good degree, lands a great high paying job at a tech company, starts saving right away, and retires in their early 30‚Äôs .  Absolutely nothing wrong with that ‚Äì wish I had done it that way. 

 I have been FI for a few years and figure I am about 5 years from RE, so I thought I would share my story for those of us that did not have our act together, early on.

 I barely graduated high school in 1989.  I think I failed 2 classes my senior year solely because I skipped too many days.  With absolutely no interest in school, I got a job doing construction work.  Getting bored with that, I enlisted in the Air Force in 1991 (starting pay $697.20/mo).  A co-worker convinced me to take a college class with him.  What started as 3 semester hours, quickly increased to 15/18 semester hours.  While I would not say it was enjoyable, it did give me something to focus on.

In 1996, I completed my degree in business (from a school I guarantee you have not heard of) and was accepted to Officer Training School.  Along with the 52% bump in pay with becoming an officer, I met my future wife.  Fortunately, she was way better at managing money than I was.  When I got to my next assignment, I started my MBA.

 In 2000, my wife and I welcomed our daughter.  After 10 years, I left the Air Force in 2001 with about $40K (wife/my IRAs) and $10K for a house down payment.

I started off an IT consultant.  My pay was about twice what I made in the military, but the first job did not last long as the company went out of business.  Fortunately, I was able to quickly move to a client, doing the same work - with a raise.

 Over the next 20 years, I continued to work/advance in this field, moving to different companies and getting progressive bumps in pay.  During this time, we kept saving more.  Maxing out IRAs, 401ks, Coverdell, even a Mega Backdoor Roth for a few years.  At the peak, we were probably saving 70% of my income. 

 Most of my jobs required a lot of international travel, so I was able to travel the world in business/first class, on the company‚Äôs dime.  While I have been to around 50 countries on 6 continents, there were probably 15-20 countries that I traveled to a bit more frequently.  My wife and daughter were able to accompany me on several of these trips.  For personal trips, I had lots of points/miles.  I tease my wife and daughter that they are spoiled because the first time they had to fly economy for an international trip was in 2018.

 After moving on from my last job (completing my 2nd Master‚Äôs degree, while I was there), I came to the realization that I really did not like working anymore.  I was always one of those guys that thought I would work forever.  Then that number dropped to 67, then 65, then 60.  Now I have got 54 as my number (~5 years away).

 I have $2.6M in retirement savings, a rental house that is paid off, and my daughter has 3 semesters of college left.  We just used up her college savings, so will pay off the remainder as the bills come in.  Our only debt is our current residence and we just got that refinanced to 2.75%.

 My goal is to get to $4M in retirement savings before retiring.  Using conservative numbers, along with our current savings approach, this is doable.  Our rental property will get sold off to purchase our retirement home, wherever that might be.  My wife and I are starting to research areas.

 Compared to most people, I am in a pretty good place financially.  Especially when you consider how I started off and that I am missing 10 years of work-related retirement savings/matching.  I put this story out there to demonstrate to others that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible‚Äù or will ‚Äúnever be able to do what these other people have done.‚Äù  It will not be easy, and it will take a lot of effort or commitment on your part, but it is possible.

 
Some general thoughts/recommendations from my experience:

-Get a degree!  Do not overpay for it and make sure you can get a job with it.

-Max out your tax advantaged accounts.  You will never get to where you want to be without doing this.  It is going to be painful, but once you adjust, you will not miss it.

-Being a landlord is OK, but it is nowhere near as simple or handsfree as people make it out to be.  I would have been much better off (with a lot less hassle) if my money sat in the market.

-If you are saving money for your kids to go to college ‚Äì save MORE.

-The Air Force is a perfectly good way to get started.  However, you will need to maintain focus.  Get into a career field with a marketable skill and go to school.  It is a lot more fun to drink with your buddies than it is to go to classes at night.

**""Okay cut the shit, what is 'Average'?""**

**Lifestyle/Expenses**

I am a ""low maintenance person"", so I have a fairly cheap ($750/mo) room rented with housemates (edit: After 6 years, I am finally starting to getting sick of this. Time for an upgrade soon...). No car, bike to work, bus if I'm going somewhere I don't want to bike. Gracious friends help for rides if I'm going somewhere I can't bus or bike to (and then I treat them to lunch, if they'll let me).

Food cost \~$380/mo. I do most of my cooking/bring lunch to work, but don't consciously try to penny pinch at the grocery store. I get the good ice-cream. Food is expensive where I live.

The rest of the expenses are small, but add up to \~$1,800-1,900/mo. Happy to share more info about expenses etc. if you have any questions.

&#x200B;

**Strategy**

Basically, Index funds buy & hold. Nothing too complicated here.

I mostly follow the FIRE investing meme hivemind.

&#x200B;

**Reflecting/Looking Forward**

I definitely realize the market has been an absolute beast for helping me reach this milestone. I'm not sure I expect it to work quite so hard for me in the future (either way, it doesn't affect my approach to investing/FI).  Currently planning for a conservativeish 3.75% withdrawal rate, and have just reached \~50% of my average expenses, \~25% to my arbitrary FI number, which I'm sure will increase. Current planned FI number allows for just over 2x my current expenses. Slow and steady wins the race.

I tried posting in a few other subreddits at the time, but never ended up with any meaningful discussion on the topic.

In a nutshell, if your parents ran themselves flat broke because they were irresponsible - and yet you were very responsible and FIRE‚Äôd, your state may be able to come after your hard-earned finances too.  Your parents credit card debts may not be able to be transferred to you, but depending on your state their medical costs potentially could.

Has anyone consulted with a lawyer or trust attorney in order to build strategies to protect assets from these types of cases?  I wonder whether certain asset classes are beyond reach - such as retirement accounts, and a home.

I know a lot of people here are working hard to reach FIRE, and have some very smart ideas on how to get their and how to live on a safe withdrawal rate.

If you choose the right location and the smaller home isnt particularly terrible why wont it rise in price the same way? I could always sell the smaller home and move up right?

Another year, another 100k, and in the middle of a pandemic to boot -\_-. I‚Äôve kept my previous post mainly intact but have made changes in ***bolded italics. All mentions of currency are in CAD.***

***Side note: I‚Äôm definitely at the point where market volatility is very noticeable on my portfolio. Stay the course peeps!***

**About me**

Hi! I‚Äôm a ***28F*** CPA living in Toronto, Canada. I wanted to post this to show the non IT people in this sub that there are other careers where it‚Äôs possible to increase net worth quickly despite not making 100k right out of school. I‚Äôve always been a saver but I discovered MMM in December 2015 (when I was 24). The realization I could retire at 35 really lit a fire under my ass to save even more and actually invest it. I was working through my CPA at a big 4 accounting firm at the time and hated every second of it. To be honest, accounting is boring and a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô career at best, but the money is good so I will most likely stay on this path until I feel FI enough, if not actual FIRE.

I live in the most if not second most expensive city in Canada, sharing a small home with my SO that we purchased last year. I have no expensive hobbies other than travel and lead a pretty ‚Äòboring‚Äô life. I‚Äôm slowly getting healthier and into exercising but those things are harder for me than saving money.

The privilege ‚Äì My parents paid for 3 out of my 4 years of university. That‚Äôs about 36k that I got for free which will never have to be repaid (I asked). That one year I paid for and for the 2 years I lived on campus I paid for myself through part time jobs before and during university. I also went back to live with my parents for one year rent free during my ***7*** years of working, which was a nice boost to my net worth during that time.

Here are the numbers!

**The goals**

My spending goal in retirement for one person is $20,000-$30,000 per year (as part of a $40,000-$60,000 spend household). I expect my SO to pay their own way on this FIRE journey. The dream at the moment looks like one year on one year off long term slow travel, most likely for 5ish years of travel. On the off years, we could work, volunteer, whatever. These FIRE plans are not that defined because who knows what I‚Äôll feel like in 5-10 years.

All else being equal (is it ever?) I expect to achieve the following net worth milestones at the following ages:

   

**Annual Spend (individual)**

&#x200B;

| **Annual Spend (individual)** | **$20,000.00** || **$25,000.00** || **$30,000.00** ||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| FI @ 4% | $500,000.00 |29| $625,000.00 |30| $750,000.00 |33|
| FI @ 3.5% | $571,428.57 |30| $714,285.71 |31| $857,142.86 |34|
| FI @ 3.25% | $615,384.62 |30|$769,230.77|32| $923,076.92 |35|
| FI @ 3% | $666,666.67 |31| $833,333.33 |32| $1,000,000.00 |35|

\^the above does not account for market corrections/recessions. If one happens tomorrow obviously those ages will change. ***(BAHAHAHAHA COVID)***

My flair is based on the first goal - $500k for 20k of spending at 4%. Is that going to be the number I FIRE at? Probably not, given the expectation of a low growth environment in the near future and my young age at the expected time. But it‚Äôs a number that I would feel comfortable about enough to shift into something more chill. It‚Äôs possible and even likely that I‚Äôll experience the golden handcuffs phenom and stay for a while past that though to feather the nest and add security.

Future plan/goals ‚Äì I have no interest in having children, which enables my fast FIRE journey and long term travel plans. ***Currently we live in a small bungalow in Scarbs with a basement unit that pays rent. Looking forward to selling in the next few years and buying a teardown to re-build, no enjoying living in an old house.*** While Canada is great, it‚Äôs also possible that I will be OK with living somewhere else with single payer health care long term (I hate winter).

**Income history and Net Worth**

I started my career at a big 4 accounting firm making 45k, then 50k the next year, then 60k the next. These are standard salaries for this job in my city ‚Äì Toronto. During this time I was renting a place downtown with a roommate or SO.

After leaving the firm my first job out was at 75k, and I moved to live with my parents for that year. Getting rid of rent was amazing for my net worth. Then I moved to a more interesting job that I thought I would love for 80k and started paying rent again. ***Then I got bored and moved to my current job, where I made 95k the first year and now 100k with very generous 20-30% bonuses. First year we (my SO and i) lived downtown paying rent, now paying down a mortgage.***

I do have access to a side hustle that I started participating in around 2016. It‚Äôs very CPA specific and involves helping incoming CPAs get feedback for their practice exams in preparation for the qualification exams we have to write in this profession (PEP and CAP for those in the know). I think I made <$2000 the first year I did it, but it grew steadily and I made $***33,000*** last year from this.

My net worth started at -$10,000 on the day I graduated university in the summer of 2013. That debt was owed to my parents for a lavish long trip I took that summer which I repaid in my first year of working. No regrets. After I started working and saving, it began steadily going up. My records are spotty in the beginning, since I was just saving to save.

All else equal and barring a downturn, I hope to achieve the 300k milestone around winter 2019. Depending on the side hustle this year and with my increased income, here‚Äôs hoping for Dec 2018 instead of March 2019. Well that didn‚Äôt work out, but that was mainly because of saving up for the house during the low market in the 2018 winter and the closing costs.

Why the big jumps toward the end there? Bonuses and side hustle money coming through (it comes in large chunks) and the tenant providing first and last helped as well.

The 300k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2019, one year after 200k. It‚Äôs definitely getting easier and easier to amass more money as my income grows and the growth compounds due to the nest egg size.

I‚Äôm hoping 400k comes around the same time next year. Side hustle should be around the same this year but we‚Äôre planning a lavish vacation and some minor renovations***.***

***Variable mortgages are great during times like this, April was our first reduced month. Renovations are about halfway done; hopefully we‚Äôll finish in a few months. We pay insurance in a lump sum payment, my work pays for my phone, and any medication/dental not covered by work health insurance is in misc. I‚Äôve worked from home for majority of March and all of April so transportation costs are not normal. Unfortunately it looks like vacation is out of the question this year so we‚Äôll save a few thousand there in the overall figures.***

Please keep in mind that these expenses are for myself only. My SO and I split household expenses and spend our own money on items like clothes or video games. I don‚Äôt foresee our essentials spending increasing above what it currently is and the tenant is very helpful in reducing those costs to a level where it is cheaper to live in the house than our previous condo rental without taking into account future selling prices, etc. We did consult a rent vs buy calculator before purchasing and the house was still in the buy zone which is rare for Toronto. ***I foresee us staying here for around 2-5 years before flipping into a newer home.*** 

**Investments**

My tax advantaged accounts are maxed out and self-managed through a DIY brokerage. My taxable contributions are split evenly between the same self-managed DIY brokerage and a robo advisor for shits and giggles. The robo advisor is winning at the moment, because I view my DIY brokerage holdings as a whole unit so my taxable account gets the brunt of the bonds (low rate environment).

The DIY Portfolio is as follows:

***Cash: 0.6% (preference is 0%), everything is in the market J***

***Bonds: 1.9% (preference is 5%), sold it all in March to buy more ETFs.***

***REITs: 2.3% (preference is 2.5%), VRE mostly. Also meh about this allocation.*** **~~This will go the way of the bonds when I need to rebalance if the market makes moves. Since I own a home now this is not required.<~~** ***that‚Äôs what I said last year, thinking REITs are inversely related to general market performance. Not for this recession‚Ä¶.***

***Canadian dividend stocks: 4.1% (preference is 2%, my investing strategy used to be dividend based so this is a remaining position from then), CDZ.***

***Canadian Market: 1.7% (preference is 2.5%),VCN***

***US Market ‚Äì hedged to CAD: 24.6% (preference is 25.5%),VUS/VSP***

***US Market ‚Äì unhedged: 26.9% (preference is 25.5%), VUN/VTI(n USD)***

***International (both developed and developing) ‚Äì unhedged: 37.9% (preference is 36.5%) XEF+XEC/VXUS(in USD)***

My robo advisor has split my investments as follows:

Cash: 6%

Bonds: $9%

Low carbon global stocks: 30%

Canadian stocks: 24%

Global stocks: 16%

Cleantech stocks: 15%

***I finally called them to change my risk level from 8 to 9.***

I‚Äôd love any advice on my allocations. I rebalance when I invest so it‚Äôs a bit slow.

Because I have reached coast fire, I‚Äôd like to spend the next 12 months spending every dollar that I earn from my job. 

Why? A few reasons...I have lived very, very modestly the past 7 years since I‚Äôve graduated and saved/invested almost everything (70%+ savings rate for all my working years). I have purposely lived like a very poor student and instead of lifestyle inflation, participated in lifestyle deflation. Had very close high school friend of mine recently pass away suddenly at such a young age. This shook me and I realize I can‚Äôt take anything for granted. I recently turned 30 and I don‚Äôt know if this is an early mid-life crisis, but I‚Äôm already thinking about my mortality. 

What do I plan to spend the money on? After covering my regular annual expenses, I calculate I‚Äôll have roughy $70K (after-tax) over the course of 12 months to spend. My plan is to spend it on the below...
1. 2 week vacation with my immediate family (father, mother, sister) to St. Maarten (or equivalent if Covid makes things complicated) - $10K
2. 1 week vacation to Disneyworld with my nieces and nephews - $5K
3. One time financial gift/small token of appreciation to my parents since I‚Äôm forever grateful to them for paying for my college - $15K
4. Used luxury sports car - $50K

A few questions. Has anyone done something similar to this? Almost like a 1 year ‚Äúhall pass‚Äù to just splurge after saving/investing diligently for a while? Is there anything I‚Äôm overlooking or need to consider? Is the future value of my current portfolio after 35 years reasonably accurate (3-8 percent average growth/year)? Is this stupid to do in the middle of a pandemic? Why shouldn‚Äôt I do this?

Hello everybody!  FIRE has been the only thing keeping me going in my current career (found MMM 5 years ago).  I've been experiencing extreme burnout for the last 2 years, and it has been affecting me mentally.  I just started going to a therapist yesterday over this (hopefully this helps!)...

&#x200B;

It's made me think... Is the pain and suffering of grinding through a career you hate worth FIRE?  Am I missing the point of FIRE going down this path?

&#x200B;

I feel like I should ""enjoy the process"" rather than the destination.  I question whether ""magical happiness"" happens the second I'm FI.

&#x200B;

How do you know you'll enjoy RE?  What a waste of time would it be to grind to FI; to realize your passions/hobbys/whatever earns money/paycheck, meaning you could have left your corporate job years ago?

&#x200B;

Not sure how to test out RE; but I'm suspicious I wouldn't enjoy it FOREVER (maybe that's a sign I'm a boring person).

The grass may not be greener on the other side...  Just writing down some thoughts.  Anyone been in a similar situation?  Any suggestions?  Anyone regret grinding to FI? Or regret leaving a high salary to find out most jobs are BS?

Thank you in advance!  Hopefully this all doesn't sound too whiny.  Simply questioning the currently path I'm on (and I'm sure others are on).",446.0,financialindependence

Hello FIRE community. Recently I crossed the 400K milestone meaning I'm 1/3 way there. This came nearly as a shock when I reflected on my pre-FIRE self: spendy, #YOLO, and all about instant gratification.

I often see minimalist, frugal type of OPs achieving FIRE within a very small time frame. Or, there are the OPs with IT expertise who score big bucks in the Valley. Both are truly enviable, but both **very different** from the life that I live (ok income, very high COL, desire to maintain a certain lifestyle). **Through the years, I've found that for people like myself, it's important to understand my few CORE NEEDS/WANTS, find creative ways to fit them in my budget, and cheap out 100% on the rest.** To me, it's all about meticulously dollar-cost averaging and being flexible in a sustainable way. 

I want to give back to this community by sharing my experience on how I changed that pattern and caught up - that with a bit of lifestyle adjustment and a decent amount of determination, good habits along with wealth can be accumulated at a decent rate, given permissible market conditions.

30F; graduated in 2012; no kids; very HCOL. 

Numbers:

||Income (USD after tax)|NW (USD) |
|:-|:-|:-|
|2012|70k|10k|
|2013|72k|35k|
|2014|74k|76k|

|2018|95k|296k|
|2019|100k|386k|
|2020|111k|402k|

My NW consists of my brokerage account balances of $185k (ETFs, mutual funds, single stocks for fun; diversified into global markets with a pre-set allocation), retirement accounts of $100k (global ETFs), cash and FX of $17k, and half a property valued at $100k.

Largest expenses: $1100 rent; $600 food; $400 to parents; $400 on unrequited passions which are now expensive hobbies

Things that helped me get ahead: 

1. Upbringing in a frugal household. Parents' combined incomes never even came close to mine, but they've always lived below their means which allowed them to save continuously. Absolutely no debt; even the home was bought with cash in full. The upbringing definitely made being frugal a lot more natural to me when I put my mind to it.
2. Merit based scholarships for college which covered tuition. Disliking debt, parents took out  retirement savings to help with room and board. I took part time jobs, but spent my summers working meaningful internships which didn't necessarily pay. 0 NW at graduation.
3. Majored in things that were most conducive to employment and kissed my passions goodbye. Hustled self into a decent paying banking job before graduation. Immediate cash flow after graduation.

Things that worked against me:

1. Embraced my life as an income earning young adult way too hard. I blew money on stupid nice things because ""i am finally standing on my own two feet"".
2. Too confident that I'd continue to climb the corporate ladder infinitely. Which directly resulted inn overspending and underinvesting in the early half of my career, missing out on an extended period of the bull run.  

  
Lessons:

In 7 years I went from stupid spendy to aggressively saving. The most important thing that happened was probably a shifted view on spending which dialed down my expenses in a **sustainable way. Here are few things that really helped me:**

1. **Intentionally be looking for deals:** supermarket sales after 8pm; buy 2 get 1 free tissue boxes; collect and use coupons; shop around before committing to a big purchase, etc. Buy second hand. Fix/do things around the house by myself. Instead of buying new mops I cut old t-shirts and towels to mop the floor with. It may seem small but it does add up. **This is the part where I live significantly below my means.**
2. **Cook simple meals at home** whenever possible. Cooking itself can be relaxing, the food is healthier, and the savings are hard to beat.
3. **Be selective and mindful when eating out**. I pre-game at home when I can, so that when I'm out at clubs I only need to order 4 drinks instead of 14. Take doggie bags home from restaurants. Also this might sound weird, but sometimes I intentionally order dishes such as stews when eating out so that I pack the broth and can toss together a quick meal at home the day after to **dollar-cost average** the meals.
4. **Travel wisely**. I use my mileage and loyalty points, fly red eye when I can handle it, travel off-season to save cost. And I always haggle.
5. Go out and get the stuff I truly want. Rinse. Repeat.

202,"Our Story (33M/31F): Going from $250k in Student Loans to $250k in Net Worth With Type I Diabetes, Two Kids, and a Saga Across Three States.",,790.0,iakz3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iakz3g/our_story_33m31f_going_from_250k_in_student_loans/,1597546488.0,"## In the Beginning (Post Undergrad Years) (23M/21F)

Our  story begins pretty much the same time as our relationship. I met who would eventually be my wife during our last year in undergrad where we  were both majoring in Molecular Biology. I had switched majors from  Aerospace Engineering but that's a story for another time.

My  wife graduated and began studying for the MCAT a semester before I  finished. She spent some time shadowing doctors and didn't find the ones  she shadowed to be that happy, lessening the appeal of going through  med school. She also feared the debt necessary to fund that education  and so decided she'd be more interested in a medical profession that  provided more opportunity to change specialties so she decided not to  take the exam. Long story short we both entered the labor market in Fall  of 2010.

My first job after  college was as a research embryologist for a small research lab I found  on Craigslist of all places. I had about $23k of debt from undergrad and  started at $15/hr but opted to stay on my parent's medical insurance  which added the equivalent of $1/hr extra. We had access to a 401k with  no matching to which I did **not** contribute. I was able to work up to 1.5 hours of overtime per week and did so as often as I could. **My net worth was -$23k**.

My  wife started as a research assistant with a State University lab making  $31k which included what I know now is a very rare automatic  contribution to a pension to be paid starting at age 65 with a benefit  based on years of service. Fortunately she had taken enough college  level coursework in high school to only need 3 years to obtain her  bachelor's degree and was able to work enough in college to avoid taking  student loans. I wasn't privy to her finances at the time but now know **she had a net worth of about $8k** from savings throughout her life.

We  moved in together shortly after starting these jobs but didn't combine  finances and split all our bills 50/50. I used my remainder after  monthly expenses to attempt to slowly pay down my student loan debt.  Foolishly I would calculate down to the last $50 of my checking account  and kept no emergency fund, a decision which my wife would argue with me  about until I finally decided to keep $500 as my maximum depletion  amount.

We both performed well at  our jobs and after 2 years I had increased my pay to $17/hr and was  still getting $1/hr extra by opting out of health insurance and staying  on my parent's plan. I had managed to get my student loan balance down  to about $10k but was still not contributing to retirement or saving  much of anything.

My wife was  feeling the itch to pursue a career in medicine and had decided that she  would apply for Physician Assistant school due to its greater specialty  flexibility over medical school. However, a prerequisite was direct  patient hours which she was not getting in her job as a research  assistant. She was able to find another opportunity with the University  as a Clinical Research Coordinator which gave not only patient contact  but came with a pay increase to $41k and continued contributions to the  pension plan.

We got engaged  shortly before my wife was accepted into PA school in another state and I  decided I would leave my job in order to move across the country with  her. We decided it might be a good time for me to pursue additional  education as well. I had been taking some courses online in my evenings  on statistics and programming and happened across the field of  bioinformatics. Having always been passionate about computers as a hobby  I saw bioinformatics as a way to combine biology and computer science  and hopefully advance my career outlook. Fortunately I found a master's  degree program that was available 100% remotely and I was accepted to  begin the same semester as my wife started PA school.

When we left our jobs our **combined net worth was about $0** with my $10k in outstanding undergrad loans and my wife's now $10k of savings.

## Back to School and Loading Up on Debt (26M/24F)

My  masters program took 24 months to complete and my wife's took 27. My  wife's program required students not take outside employment to not  interfere with rotations and coursework and I felt overwhelmed enough by  attempting to transition into more computer science heavy coursework  coming from a biology background that neither of us ended up working  during grad school.

I am a Type I  Diabetic (insulin dependent) and we started grad school shortly after  the ACA was passed, meaning I could no longer be denied coverage for my  preexisting condition. I purchased an insurance plan from the market  that covered the diabetes care I would need but had to pay for the  premium and co-insurance from our student loans.

By  the time we were finished we had accumulated $250k in student loans,  interest included. I had one paid internship in the middle of my program  where I earned $6k but otherwise we lived our entire lives on loans.  Most went to tuition, medicine, and rent but we did allow ourselves  occasional eating out, alcohol, and entertainment. We also got married,  and managed to keep the cost under $5k!

## Finishing Grad School, Starting Careers, a Family, and Medical Problems (28M/26F)

Fortunately  my internship finished with a job offer to return after graduation that  I accepted in yet another different state. I started while my wife was  finishing up PA school which caused us to live in different states for 3  months. I started at $72k with a generous benefits package including a  9% 401K match, an HSA with a $2,000 automatic employer contribution, and  health and dental insurance.

My  wife followed a few months later and was able to find a job after about a  month as a PA in a rheumatology practice. It was a contract-to-hire  position where she would either be hired or released after  six months.  Her six month contract was for $40/hr with no retirement benefits but  included medical which she declined as we were both on my work's plan.

We started our new careers with a **combined net worth of about -$240k**.

Happily,  we both found success in our new careers and enjoyed rapid advancement  and raises and as a unit averaged an 8% increase in pay per year over  the next five years. My wife was hired from her contract and got a bump  to $100k and began to receive a 4% retirement match if she contributed  6% of her base salary.

We both  began to take more of an interest in personal finance, but still hadn't  discovered the concept of financial independence. We were very motivated  to pay off our mountain of debt so began to track our expenses  diligently (first with Mint, now with YNAB). We contributed enough to  get our retirement match and everything else left at the end of each  month went towards loans.

Our jobs  are located in a HCOL area so we chose to live in an older apartment  complex our first two years and then transitioned to a town house 3  years ago where we still live. We have been paying $2,000/mo for a 3/2.5  1600sqft unit (not rennovated) which is very close to work so we don't  need to have much of a commute. We could definitely find lower rent  farther from work but it would add 45+ minutes each way.

As  we began to see serious progress on our student loans our interest in  personal finance grew and we discovered the idea of financial  independence. That concept still had to sit on the back burner for a  while since we decided paying off our loans would be a priority until  the remaining loans were at an interest rate < 4.5% which  unfortunately was only about $30k of our total balance.

After  6 months of working our net worth climbed to -$200k. Then -$150k after  12 months. We managed a pace of increasing our net worth through paying  off student loans to the tune of $100k/yr for almost exactly 5 years.

We hit **net worth $0 in August of 2018**  just as our first child was born. 3 weeks before he was born I had to  have a kidney removed due to a genetic condition which caused it to fill  with fluid and swell like a water balloon which destroys its ability to  filter. Fortunately we were already used to having maximum medical  expenses due to my diabetes so the pregnancy and the kidney removal  weren't really much of a factor financially due to hitting our out of  pocket max.

## Present Day (33M/31F)

We finally **paid off our student loans and hit $150k net worth in January of this year (2020)**.  We gave birth to our second child in March of this year just in time to  get home before the pandemic started to really spread. We are both  incredibly fortunate in that we have been able to continue working at  the same jobs and at the same pay as before the pandemic and that  allowed us to reach **$250k net worth**  this month. My Dad retired a few years ago and my Mom was forced into  retirement by the pandemic so we are also incredibly fortunate that they  are willing to watch the kids while we work. We pretty much just  flipped the switch of paying off student loans to contributing for  retirement so have really been enjoying actually getting to keep most of  our money this year instead of shoveling it into loans.

We  certainly experienced a lot of luck in our journey but also a lot of  hard work and made a pretty radical change in our lives that benefited  us immensely. This is now the longest thing I've ever written on Reddit so I should stop rambling here. Thanks for  reading!",88.0,financialindependence

This sub often talks about the financial aspects of receiving a windfall, but I want to focus on the emotional aspects of inheriting a large some of money for those who are struggling with the emotions that come with receiving a large sum.  Managing your emotions can be as equally important as managing your money and the two often go hand in hand. I would like to share a bit about two different paths that my brother and I took and share some of the emotional struggles I have had with receiving a large sum of money from a young age and how I manage those emotions. I hope that this post can help other people who might have similar feelings to what I have experienced.

**Brief Background**

When I was in my first year of college, about 10 years ago, my final grandparent passed away. My brother and I received a lot of money, about 750k each.  By the time I received full ownership of the money at 25 years old, it had grown to 1.2 million due to most of the money already being invested.  

**What each of us did after receiving the inheritance**

My brother has always been a hard worker and it‚Äôs something I admire him for.  He was working in a dead end job he more or less enjoyed, but that didn‚Äôt pay well.  He decided to pursue something else a few years after receiving the money and went for his masters degree. He now works at a stable job that pays pretty well and that he loves.  He lives in a HCOL area and put down a large down payment on a wonderful house. When I was renting a room from him, he would leave early in the morning and get home later.  He probably put in 50+ hours every week and up to 60+ at times for the first couple of years.   As I said, my brother is a hard worker. There were many days or weeks that were very stressful and he was exhausted when he got home.  But now that he is more settled in the job, he takes off more from work to do the things he wants to do and indulges in some of his more expensive hobbies.  He has no intention of quitting his job and continues to gain a steady income.  On this sub, this is the recommended path. Work like you would have done if you hadn‚Äôt received a windfall and enjoy the benefits of it growing.   

For those of you like me who struggle with the recommended path I‚Äôll share what I have done. I completed college and hopped around trying different jobs. First, I worked a job in my field of study.  Then I worked in retail for a bit before I tried a different type of job in my field of study.  I ended up having a mental breakdown in that job.  My next career decision took me to a low cost of living country where I now work teaching English.

For whatever reason, I have really struggled with working full time and adapting to adult life.  It could be argued that my inheritance has contributed to that as in full time jobs it‚Äôs really hard to stay motivated when rent and satisfying basic needs is not a concern if I leave my job.  It‚Äôs easy to transition the thought of ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt worth it‚Äù into action.  It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm a bad worker.  I always arrived on time to my shifts and rarely slacked off.  But after awhile in a job I start to realize the job isn‚Äôt really fulfilling and working for my mental health, and so I look for the next thing that I think will give me a sense of fulfillment.  Therefore, I don‚Äôt know if I would have adapted to full time work even if I hadn‚Äôt received my inheritance.

**Guilt**

There are some problems that come with receiving a lot of money.  I‚Äôm not saying these problems are worse than other peoples.  Just that there are problems and one of the main ones is the feelings of guilt that can come from receiving a large sum.   Over the years, I have felt a lot of guilt, whether from personal or societal pressures. I‚Äôm sure some of these aren‚Äôt only exclusive to people who have received money, but I still want to share them as I think they are pretty common among people who have received a windfall and are experienced to varying degrees at different times. Here is a list of some of those things:

1)feeling like I don‚Äôt deserve and didn‚Äôt earn the windfall.

2)feeling like I‚Äôm wasting my potential if I don‚Äôt do something special with the opportunity the money has given me.

3)feeling like my achievements are lesser than others.

4)feeling like I have to solve other people‚Äôs financial problems.

5)feeling bad for spending any of the money.

6)feeling like I‚Äôm not allowed to have problems.

Include separate for not having to struggle like other people?

**What has helped me with the guilt.**

It‚Äôs important to work on these feelings of guilt because if you don‚Äôt, you risk the chance of making unintelligent decisions.  Here are some things that have helped me in the past.

1) It‚Äôs really interesting how we view what people deserve or don‚Äôt deserve.  People tend to think good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, but the reality is a lot of life is random. So we might look at people working hard to get the same amount of money that was given to us and we feel guilty for not having to make the sacrifices they do. After all, we aren‚Äôt better than them so why do we deserve to not work like they do? But remember that the person who chose to give it to you deserved to give their money to whoever they wanted to. So I think it‚Äôs important to be constantly thankful for the people or person that gave it to you.  I feel less guilty when I see that money as something that was given to me so I could pursue whatever I want in life that makes me feel fulfilled and happy.  

Also, one of the things my therapist challenged me on is how to think about the idea of earning money. Have I earned my initial net worth by showing up at a job and exchanging my labor for money? No.  But all the additional earnings that my investments make, is earned money in a sense.  Not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that every dollar of gains is from money I chose not to spend, even when I could.  

2) The idea of potential is often associated with career, but that is only one aspect of your potential.  But because people mainly focus on career potential, people will judge you if you don‚Äôt use your money to further yourself in your career or to start a business.  There is really only one potential in your life that I believe matters, and that‚Äôs feeling fulfilled and satisfied with life.  So do whatever brings you long term fulfillment and figure out what is truly important for you and distinguish that from what other people think you should be doing.  For me, it‚Äôs working for some of my own money while also having a lot of free time to pursue my hobbies and activities.  This obviously changes over time so just be aware that what brings you satisfaction now will probably be different even a couple years from now.  

3) Guilt about potential plays a bit into guilt about achievements.  It‚Äôs easy to look at other people‚Äôs achievements and compare them to your own.  When I compare myself to what other people are doing with their lives, it‚Äôs easy to think I‚Äôm not doing enough and this is amplified with the false belief that because I have the financial resources to do anything I want, it means that I could do anything in life. When really it means that I can pursue anything that I am willing to make sacrifices for.  It‚Äôs easy to look at another person‚Äôs income on this sub and think ‚Äòwow, if only I put in the effort like that person, I could make 150k+ too.‚Äô But in reality, you don‚Äôt know the true amount of effort that that person has put to get there, effort that you might not even be capable of.  You don‚Äôt know how many things that person had to sacrifice, the amount of stress they endured, or their goals that motivated them to achieve that level of income.

But you know what you have sacrificed for your own personal achievements and they are things you can be proud of.  While it‚Äôs important to recognize other people‚Äôs achievements, it‚Äôs also important to recognize your own achievements and to take the time to be proud of them.

4)  My first reaction, and maybe yours too, to hearing someone having financial difficulties is to want to help them.  And if I were to feel guilty about the money I have, I would probably feel obligated to help them out financially.  But constantly doing that would set me on the path to giving all of my money away and prevent me from reaching my own goals.  I have found that most of the time, people end up solving their financial problems on their own and are really just looking to vent. Even just offering a listening ear is often a good enough way to help out your friends and family.

Now I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt ever give money to help people.  I think charity and helping out friends and family is noble and it is something I would like to do more of at some point in my life when I feel more income stable.  What I am saying is don‚Äôt ever feel obligated to give money to other people if you don‚Äôt want to or aren‚Äôt comfortable with it.  Personally, I have my own financial and life goals and I‚Äôm not comfortable giving away large sums. But, if charity is very important to you, select an amount you are comfortable donating or donate some time to help out.  

5) This can especially play off the feeling of not deserving the money you received.  So if you buy anything with ‚Äòunearned‚Äô money then you didn‚Äôt really earn that object and you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to enjoy something that you didn‚Äôt earn.  But that type of thinking ruins the joy for anything that you spend money on, which is a lot of things in this life.  While I‚Äôm not advocating for spending without any care in the world, I am advocating for guilt free spending.   

To help prevent overspending, it‚Äôs important to still have a budget no matter your level of wealth.  Find an amount you are comfortable with spending per month/year and stick to that budget.  For me, I take out enough money to cover my basic needs and a little extra fun money, but I still leave enough to let my windfall continue to grow.  It can be easy to go over the budget when looking at your bank balance, but this is where a lot self-discipline comes into play.  This has serves two purposes: It prevents you from buying things frivolously and over time eroding your windfall.  And it also creates an artificial constraint where you begin to want to earn money.  As I said earlier, having such a large windfall has made money less of a motivation for me, but when I feel a constraint on spending, even an artificial one, it makes me want to earn money with my own skills.  The only exception I make is for important medical related things.

Developing some sort of professional skills is good and I really recommend any sort of skill that can be freelanced if you struggle with full time work.  It has been important for me to acknowledge that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pursue this kind of career path had I not received my inheritance.  Feeling like I am still having to use my own skills to earn additional money has given me quite a lot of personal satisfaction.

6) For the final point of not feeling like I can have my own problems. People are judgmental.  It‚Äôs a fact of life.  And people tend to look at those who have been very fortunate as not being allowed to complain about things or have their own problems.  But that‚Äôs not true.  Are my problems as stressful as someone who has to worry about not making rent and barely being able to feed their family?  Hell no! But someone having a more stressful situation than me doesn‚Äôt make my problems any less problematic for me.  So it‚Äôs okay for you to struggle with the guilt and other emotions that can come with having received a large windfall.   

**Conclusion**

I hope some of the things I have written can help you a bit to navigate the emotions with receiving an inheritance or windfall.  I would be interested to know in what other ways you have felt guilty or other ways in which you were able to manage some of your guilt.",181.0,financialindependence

How did my second year of RE go amidst COVID-19 and everything else that happened in 2020?  Read on to find out! :-) 

As usual, I've provided the TL/DR up front, but encourage you to read the qualitative details in the body of the post as I think that a story is so much more than just some numbers and bullet points.

For those who aren't familiar with my story, here are links to the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/)  from early 2019 and [1 Year Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f261kn/update_1_year_in_and_loving_it_35_11m_luck/) in early 2020.

TL/DR:

* Net worth increased from $1.40M to $1.61M
* Spent  $30,600 which is under my budget of $33500. This was despite donating an unbudgeted $5400 to charitable organizations
* Cancelled most my of travel plans and adapted to COVID shelter-in-place orders
* Got an article written on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanderousseau/2020/03/05/36-year-old-retiree-5-years-without-paying-housing/) about me
* Invited to a WNYC radio program about finances, but it didn't materialize because of COVID.
* Joined the board of directors and became an officer at one of my queer summer camps
* Didn't meet any of my goals I set out for 2020
* Played A LOT of board and video games online

# Life in a Time of Covid

2020 will almost certainly be remembered and defined by COVID and the changes that came from it. I have a friend who was already ringing alarm bells by mid-January about its possible impact, so I had some time to process and mentally prepare for things once the shelter-in-place orders actually hit in March.

Despite being a fairly low risk to severe impacts of COVID (relatively young and no conditions that pre-dispose myself to severe complications), I chose to take what most would consider to be low risk approach for reasons including, but not limited to, wanting to minimize my potential risk to others and that the long-haul effects of the virus are still very unknown. I have the privilege of not needing to work and put myself at risk and I want to ensure that I'm not contributing to the risk of those who don't have a choice and/or are vulnerable.

*Note: Everyone has their own situation and I'm not attemtping to shame anyone for their personal choices. As someone who is part of the queer community, I think the AIDS crisis is a good, but imperfect, analogy and lesson at how shaming does not work and discussion of harm reduction is the most effective tactic. The limitation of that analogy is that you are effectively only putting yourself and your sexual partners at risk, whereas with COVID, you could really be harming a lot more people who haven't opted in to your risk profile. In short, there are personal decisions that people need to make like seeing their family or having some companionship, but I will in no way condone egregious actions like large unmasked gatherings.*

As an extroverted person who would host regular board game nights, go rock climbing with my climbing partner at the gym, see theater productions, go to board game conventions with thousands of people, and travel to multiple international destinations each year, this year has certainly been difficult. It isn't the year I planned, but I have tried to make the best of it as possible.

How have I adapted to varying shelter in place orders and tried to salvage a pretty bad year?

* Created a couple of Discord servers to maintain contact with various friend groups
* Played board games online using Tabletop Simulator with Discord - I logged over 450 hours on Tabletop Simulator alone!
* Played video Games - Logged 350 hours of Civilization 6 and 175 hours of Hades
* Got a crash pad and been rock climbing outdoor (past two months)
* Movie nights over Zoom/Discord
* Volunteer work online - phonebanking for elections, virtual summer camp activities, virtual workshops.

Basically - Discord and online video/board games have been keeping me sane.

# Major Life Events

Content/Trigger warning - Death and suicide mentioned in the next set of bullet points

* Became a first time uncle but unfortunately couldn't visit my niece. Hoping it will happen sometime by the end of 2021 or early 2022, depending on when I can get a vaccine.
* Had an acquaintance/former coworker take his own life at the beginning of the pandemic (stock market falling, depression, and pandemic stress all contributed).  This particularly impacted me because unlike the next life item, I didn't have the chance to say ""goodbye"". When I officially quit my job and turned my laptop in January, I was going to see him in the office, but I was running late to another commitment. I thought I'd be able to catch up with him some other time, but unfortunately that wasn't meant to be. My fondest memory is when we went to see a World Series game together. It was a bucket list item for me and while no one else was wanting to shell out the cash, he gladly joined me and we had a blast. We got to see Game 2 of the 2010 World Series @ AT&T Park with Matt Cain pitching a gem of a game and a wild 8th inning where the Giants scored two runs via walks and exploded to a blow out victory.
* This summer I had my mom call me and ask for me to hop on a plane to visit becuase my grandma was in the hospital and only had a few more days to live.  I packed up my stuff that night and took the first flight out in the morning. My grandparent passed away (not COVID) about two weeks later and luckily all of our family was able to spend time with her at a family member's home in pallative care and got to say our goodbyes in person.  Note - family visited while masked and socially distanced. She lived a very long life and was able to pass away with family around her, which is about as much as I could ask for given all the other heartbreaking stories I've heard this year of family members not being able to say goodbye.
* I was voluntold (I was happy to help out though) to be the coordinator/project manager and to delegate tasks and facilitate decisions between my grandma's 6 children. THIS WAS STRESSFUL. My grandma didn't even have any assets to squabble over, but decades of emotions and inter-personal conflicts surfaced. Additionally COVID created a complicating situation where, at the time, the church allowed a maximum of 30 people for the service. Problem is that my grandma has 24 direct descendents and counting spouses and step kids that put the number at 35.  This doesn't even include family friends and/or her extended adopted family (she was among one of 6 adopted children). In the end, everything ""worked out"" but not without a ~~bit of~~ LOT OF stress working through the guest list.

# Finances

**Net Worth:** Increased from $1.40M to $1.61M

**Income:** Dividends + Capital Gains: $18,100  (The Capital Gains were via distributions, not sale of investments)

**Spending:** $30,600 out of $33,500 budget. My budget at my current net worth would represent a 2.1% withdrawal rate

The linked image provides my 2020 [Budget, 2020 Actual Spend, and Differences](https://imgur.com/a/MjnLZEq).

You'll note that there are some big differenes in planned versus actual, namely my travel spend was virtually non-existant and I decided that I wanted to donate more to charity this year given that I have more than enough and there were many people and organizations that didn't have enough. Below lists out my notable notable big ticket expenditures for the year.

* Charitable Giving - $5400
* Laptop - $1600
* Rowing Machine - $1050
* Various REI Purchases - $1200

My food budget shrank significantly as I didn't eat out and rarely did take out - it was only $3500 out of a $6000 budget. I still ate well, but did a lot more home-cooking and simpler food - a lot of stuff that my mom would make for me as a kid. I fully expect that my food budget will go up once COVID restrictions lift, but I imagine that they won't go back to pre-COVID spending levels.

For 2021 I will keep my budget the same at $33,500 but will likely come in way under it with my non-charity expenses, but I will probably end up covering the difference by contributing more to charities.

**FIRE Actions:**

* Converted $12,555 from my Rollover IRA into Roth IRA as part of a Roth IRA ladder ($12,400 standard deduction but slight variance at end of day)
* Was vigilant and didn't take any buy/sell action despite the dip in the spring! I briefly lost my two comma status and I got a little bit of anxiety at the trough, but stayed firm with the buy/hold Bogleheads strategy.
* Less of a FIRE action, but more of a reduction in my FIRE risk - CA AB1482  went into effect 1/1/2020 which is effectively a state-wide rent control which limits rent increases to inflation plus 5% per year. I was conservative in my withdrawal rate knowing that a sudden rent hike could happen and I needed to account for it. But now having additional protection via this law, it means I'm EXTRA safe with my withdrawal rate.

**Lean FIRE ""Trial-Run""**

If there was one silver lining 2020 with respect to FIRE, 2020 showed me that a realistic lean FIRE number for me would be around $23,000, which were my expenses this year excluding my charitable contributions and my two big ticket purchases. At my current net worth, this would represent a 1.43% withdrawal rate. I don't plan to spending less money than my FIRE budget of $33,500 - but it shows me that I have a lot of flexibility to adapt IF I absolutely needed to.

# Notable experiences since my last update:

Despite 2020 being a pretty awful year in general, there were a few notable things non-financial experienices/accomplishments that are worth mentioning:

* Became a board member and officer for one of my queer summer camps.
* Participated in virtual queer summer camp and got the ""Golden Unicorn"" (MVP) award!
* Beat Hades and got 49/49 achievements. Highest heat beat is 22.
* Nearly finished our Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 campaign.  Our group of 4 has played S1, S2, and now S0 together and it has been a wonderful shared experience.  I'm glad we could still make playing Pandemic Legacy a reality in a the midst of a IRL Pandemic.
* Visited WDW/US for 10 days total (Pre-Covid) and got to ride Rise of the Resistance... twice. OH MY GOD that ride is AMAZING. It mixes some amazing jaw-dropping visuals, fast paced action, and a tad bit of ""immersive theater"".
* Camped at Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and a few state parks in WA.

# Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

2020 Goals

* ~~Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.~~
* ~~Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).~~
* ~~Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).~~
* ~~Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor. I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.~~

As you can see I didn't meet any of my goals for year 2, but that's COVID for ya.  I would still like to do the first three goals at some point (probably not 2021 at this rate) but realized that I no longer would like to do NOLS/Outward bound. So what are my new goals for the upcoming year? I have to temper it given that I am pretty low on the list to get vaccinated and the world is probably going to still be uncertain. The basis of these goals is based on if they can be done solo and/or with people without specific skillsets (hard to find people with the right skills to pod with and have similar risk profiles) and don't require me to be vaccinated (assuming that for the in-person interaction, it will still be masked/socially distanced).

* Continue to serve on my board and find volunteer opportunities for both queer summer camps, hopefully in person at camp.
* Get involved in local youth outdoor activities such as ICO ([https://www.sierraclub.org/ico](https://www.sierraclub.org/ico)), which has more flexibility than something like NOLS/Outward Bound. I'm also hoping to create/lead a rock climbing program for queer POC youth in my area.
* Do more local outdoor activities (climbing, hiking, biking).
* Camp at a few ""local"" National Parks - Death Valley, King's Canyon, Sequoia
* I have the least control on this last one, but as soon as I'm vaccinated I would love to take an international trip by the end of the year, ideally to Brazil or Laos.

Single income earner with 2 kids. My salary for the first 10 years was in between 50K to 80k. I read about FI around 8 years back and realized my salary was not enough to become FI. I completely focussed my attention on getting job that paid well. Luckily I was working in IT so it was easier to find ways to make more money including technology and companies to target.
I started studying and practicing for interview in December 2012. In February 2013, I found my dream job paying me 130K for a big 5 consulting firm. I stayed in the company for a year, all the while continuing to practice and study. In 2014, I landed another job for 170k. I was happy but I knew I could do better. So, continued study and found my next job for 200k in 2016.
I hate my job but funny thing is I hated my job even when I was making 50K. So for the greater good of getting to FIRE, my plan is to continue working for the next 3-5 years and then FIRE with $2M. I blame myself for not saving enough in the first 10 years but better late than never.

I am currently at $1.3M. I know a lot can change in the next 3-5 years including I can loose my job, obamacare repeal, I can get burnt out etc etc..I will change my plan and even my location when that happens.

FYI, this is my first post, please forgive my english. I hate writing just like my job :). I know my salary is higher than most others folks but please do not treat this as bragging post. I do not think I have done enough to brag. I am really a nobody and have nothing to brag. I still am only 60% of my target, rent my apartment and drive an old corolla, nothing to brag. I hope someone finds my increase in income inspirational and tries something similar.

Edit1: my expense varied from $2500(single with no kids) to $6000(married with 2 kids). And no, I do not have any crypto and never received any inheritance. Its all hard work and saving.

Edit2: In one of my humble days, I promised myself that I will help at least 1500 people. I am not there yet to provide monetory help but would love to help provide guidance to anyone who is trying to increase his salary. Remember, if a lazy bum and a job hater like me can do it, anyone else can do it. Even if you are not in IT, research based on your education and experience, what job pays well and then go all out. Think and work on it night and day and you will succeed.

Edit3: I have not stopped trying to increase my salary more. My next target is $250K to $300K. If all goes well and I can motivate myself, I will get there by March of next year.

Edit4: I have been a good saver my whole life even when I was making $50k. But of course, when I look back I think I could have saved more and invested. Thanks to my Parents who taught me how to live a happy life with modest income.

Edit5: All of you who reached out to me for suggestion via DM, I promise I will respond to each one of you. My purpose in life is to retire and then spend my life helping other fellow human beings. Thank you for reaching out.",348.0,financialindependence
210,Saving for its own sake,,753.0,jai66i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jai66i/saving_for_its_own_sake/,1602610331.0,"Over the weekend I finished Morgan Housel's new book, *The Psychology of Money.* There were several great chapters, but I think the point that I've thought the most about since, is Housel's beliefs on saving.

Morgan Housel says in the book that he saves a higher portion of his net worth (I think it was 20%) than most people his age (30s). In the chapter about saving, he talked about the fact that most people see saving as a task unto a specific expected purchase: a down payment, a car, etc. He argues that saving is good enough on its own merit -- doesn't require a specific goal -- because having a large liquid net worth gives you more protection and options.

I really liked this way of thinking. It sounded so familiar to everything I hear about financial independence that I thought it might spur a good conversation here. Is 20% of your net worth too much to keep liquid? What do you think of the idea of saving for its own sake, as opposed to always having a ""job"" for every dollar?  


**EDIT:** Really enjoying everyone's responses. I thought I'd clear up some confusion. **First**, it's a great book and this was just one chapter that I was unsure about. But I recommend the book overall and really love Housel's work.  


**Second**, I realize my language was a little confusing in how I described ""saving."" What I meant to say: Housel talks in the book about keeping 20% of his net worth in a savings account. ",257.0,financialindependence

But let's assume for the sake of this question we're avoiding that response.

I sometimes wonder if my life would be significantly better with more luxury. I have gotten to almost 50 living kind of like a college student. I drive a 2004 used car, have never owned a home, wear shirts that were Christmas presents from 20 years ago, essentially all our furniture is found or hand-me-downs, we eat out maybe once every three months, we rent a so-so house in a so-so area, I bargain shop and fret about purchases for months or even years, etc. 

Because of all this, I've thought of myself as more in the ""leanFIRE"" category and was glad to think I could get by without working fewer years. Imagine a childless couple getting by on $30k to $35k/yr on average (including rent cost). However, I wonder if I am being foolish in not enjoying the *somewhat* finer things of life at least somewhat more?  I'll never need a swimming pool, but a ""funner"" home (in a higher COL area), less bargain shopping, more musical gadgets, more trips, more restaurants, etc. may be worth working for more, at least some.

I'm a 24 year old who's been lurking around this sub for a while now - basically since I got my first job and realized I really don't want to work for the rest of my life. I'm super grateful to you all for getting me on the right track. I make about $85K gross at the moment, and my NW is sitting right around $95K. 

I've been working from home for the last 2+ months, and it's wearing on me, and really making me miss my extremely expensive hobby: horseback riding (jumpers, specifically, if there are any horse people out there). I miss riding terribly, ever since I graduated college and stopped. It quite literally is the only thing that has ever brought me that level of happiness/joy/passion before. But I don't think there is any way around the fact that it's completely incompatible with FIRE for me, unless I up my earning significantly (which won't happen anytime soon). 

How do I come to grips with this? Anyone else give up some of their passions to pursue their FIRE journey? Was it worth it? Did you get back into your hobby later in life?",430.0,financialindependence

&#x200B;

All amounts are in USD, for just myself.

For me, 500k is basically LeanFIRE. I could return to the city I used to live in and spend 18-20k a year and be perfectly content. I hit 500k recently with the recent boom in the market. I won‚Äôt RE right now, but theoretically I should feel some kind of relief at this point because I am leanFIRE, but I don‚Äôt really.

Started working January 2015

2015 ‚Äì 70k income, 24k expenses

2016 ‚Äì 100k income, 19k expenses

2017 ‚Äì 140k income, 17.5k expenses

2019 ‚Äì 200k income ‚Äì 40k expenses -> I moved to VVHCOL city here

Expected 2021 ‚Äì 250k income ‚Äì 36k expenses

Most of my compensation is base salary. A small portion is cash bonus. No stocks.

**Financial Anxiety**

You‚Äôd think I would feel better/relaxed now, but I don‚Äôt. You‚Äôll notice a common theme in this post, and that‚Äôs anxiety. I have anxiety over spending money, saving money, investments, you name it.

It‚Äôs affected my relationships a lot. At times I have been overly controlling even about my partners financial habits. Pre-covid I was seeing a therapist to help deal with this anxiety, and it has actually helped a lot to improve my personal relationships, because now I can at least recognize and feel/touch the anxiety. Before it was just hidden, unknown emotions that I couldn‚Äôt place a trigger on. I never thought of myself as an anxious person until therapy. I am outgoing, well-spoken, have no social anxiety, and don‚Äôt get anxious about presentations or speaking engagements. I do get anxious though when I splurge on a single purchase because it feels like I‚Äôm slipping into lifestyle inflation and my whole world is falling apart. I do get anxious when my partner purchases a single splurge item because I extrapolate it to the extreme - to them having given up on FIRE, and therefore we are incompatible and should break up because ‚Äòclearly FIRE isn‚Äôt important to them‚Äô. I do get anxious when my partner didn‚Äôt want to implement auto deposits every month, because they preferred every 1-2 months just going and manually doing it. To me that just felt like it was so easy to just let everything slip and fall out of control. But they had a method and it works. At the end of the day, our annual spending is very close and I really have no reason to complain or comment on anything that my partner does money wise.

Sounds crazy when you write it out, and I‚Äôve improved a lot in this regard. Therapy has helped. My partner bought a $300 splurge item recently and I barely commented on it. My partner doesn‚Äôt do automatic deposits to investments every paycheck and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all anymore. Therapy helped me understand that these were not rational reactions and I was actually reacting to the feeling of ‚Äòlosing control‚Äô and ‚Äòthings just slipping‚Äô. I still often feel the financial anxiety, but the difference is that I understand the emotion for what it is ‚Äì a mental illness. I can control my reactions, even if I sometimes can‚Äôt control my feelings. Before I didn‚Äôt realize it was anxiety, I thought my viewpoints were totally justified.

Hell, I even bought a PS5 recently for $500 and it didn‚Äôt bother me that much! I‚Äôm thankful to now understand how annoyed I would be if my partner made a huge deal every time I wanted to buy something like this. We are all adults and as long as our annual spending is reasonably in line with our goals we are fine.

So hitting LeanFIRE hasn‚Äôt really done much for me either. It doesn‚Äôt feel real at all. I‚Äôm still working and slaving away. I keep trying to tell myself that I don‚Äôt ‚Äòneed‚Äô to work, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like that. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because I know in RE I won‚Äôt follow 4% rule, likely 3%, or if I will started to feel relaxed as I gain more NW. I basically feel the same as when I was 0 NW. It might also because I feel battered and exhausted from work. If anything, I feel more like a battered, nervous wreck than I was when I was at $0 NW. Back then I felt like I had energy, and enthusiasm, and wanted to take on the world of work. Now I just want to quit. **I shouldn't feel anxiety, but I do**. To be frank I'm extremely lucky and privileged, but sometimes it just doesn't matter. Rationally I know I am very lucky and in a fantastic position. Emotionally it doesn't feel like that.

**RE plans**

I plan to work for another 5-6 or so years, but that may vary depending on a few factors. My job right now causes me a lot of anxiety. The hours are not too bad, but the pressure is high, there is often conflict, tensions are very high, and I am judged on the basis of my decision making. If I make poor decisions it affects the whole business, and I am solely responsible for making a lot of decisions. I basically hope to hold on as long as I can. Every year I am adding 130k to my investment portfolio, with an after-tax savings rate of more than 75% (I pay a LOT of taxes), so I understand the value in trying to just keep working a little bit longer. I think my goal RE number is about 1.5M, which by normal projections I would hit by 2025/2026. I also have a partner who is on the same path but a little bit younger and so is a little bit behind me. Having more cushion in my number will help my partner‚Äôs situation as well and make them feel more comfortable about RE.

I might not make it 5-6 years. I don‚Äôt know. The last 2 years have been really hard. I‚Äôm just trying to hold on as long as I can because my income is high relative to my NW. On the flip side, I might work 10 more. Trying to be flexible.

My reasons for wanting to retire are multifold

1. My job affects my mental health a lot. I just feel so much better when I‚Äôm on vacation and away from the office and away from the work stress. I‚Äôm a much happier person, my partner notices it too and says I‚Äôm a much happier person to be around when I‚Äôm away from work. This has only gotten worse as I‚Äôve moved up in roles. When I first started my career it wasn‚Äôt so bad. Now it even affects my sleep. WFH doesn‚Äôt help this either, it actually makes it worse. It‚Äôs not the hours, it‚Äôs the pressure to succeed and the stress. I actually enjoy my work when it is lower stress periods ‚Äì although not enough to spend 40 hours a week doing it. I don‚Äôt like being forced to do anything. I would consider to voluntarily work 15 hours a week even if it was unpaid, but roles like that don‚Äôt really exist for me. I don‚Äôt have enough work experience to become an independent consultant just yet, but that might be something I do down the road.
2. I want to see the world and live abroad. When I retire I will definitely move around. Having financial cushion to be flexible there helps. I don‚Äôt know for how long, or where, but FIRE gives me maximum flexibility.
3. I have a lot of hobbies and other ways to spend my time. I could sit at home for 3 months straight and not be bored. That‚Äôs not how I plan on spending retirement, but I have lots of things I want to do with my free time instead of working.
4. I probably thinking about retiring every single day. I‚Äôm actively trying to not do this, after this post and responding to comments, I won‚Äôt be coming back to this sub often. I just need to get away and focus on things outside of work to try and be happy in my day to day life.

I want to work longer and not RE yet because

1. I want more cushion because of my financial anxiety
2. I might want to spend more down the road
3. I‚Äôd be nervous about my ability to re-enter the workforce if I left and the market doesn‚Äôt do well
4. My income to networth ratio leads itself to saying I should push through as long as I can. If I was only making 30k a year with this stress, good chance I‚Äôd just quit and/or work part-time on something relaxing.
5. I have a hard time because I feel like I've struck a golden lotto ticket. Billions of people would kill to be in my shoes and I just feel like a big whiny pants sometimes. Why would I quit when I have such a nice income and reasonable hours?

I don‚Äôt want kids and neither does my partner.

**Income**

My income has gone up a lot, and I‚Äôve taken a different route than most people who have income jumps like this. I‚Äôve stayed at the exact same company who has treated me well. I‚Äôve worked hard and been promoted fast. I‚Äôve negotiated comp three times, but not that hard. My comp might be 10k less if I hadn‚Äôt. I also compare my compensation to people at my level in the company, and I am similarly paid to them. I‚Äôve also spoken to external recruiters, and I‚Äôm being paid fairly. I think the notion that you need to change jobs every 3 years to maximize comp isn‚Äôt true 100% the time. If you spend the time to negotiate, compare to your peers, and have a company who treats you right financially, there isn‚Äôt a need to move around. Every company is different. Some companies you may need to hop around because they will treat you poorly financially if you are there too long. I‚Äôve worked on 3 different teams in the same company. Also, in 2019 I moved to a VVHCOL city, and my income jumped as a result. I knew the \~250k role was coming in 2020, so that‚Äôs why the expense increase was worth it. My savings rate went down, but my total savings $ went up, and I won‚Äôt retire to VVHCOL city.

I won‚Äôt be sharing my industry or my location or any other information.

**Expenses**

I discovered FIRE midway through 2015 and started being more conscious of expenses then. I also had a few extra expenses such as some student debt to pay off in 2015. I was always frugal, but became a lot more focused once I figured out I could retire early. The biggest thing I changed after discovering FIRE was just cooking more.

I didn‚Äôt go to school in the US so my education was significantly cheaper. I graduated with only a few thousand dollars of debt. My parents contributed about $8000 to my education, the rest was self-funded. Worked in high school, had internships in college, etc.

Now my expenses are high, but of the 40k total expenses, over 2k of that is my share of the rent. I share a 1-bedroom apartment with my partner. I live in a very expensive city, but I could easily drop my expenses back down to the \~20k level by moving.

**Investments**

I‚Äôm roughly 50/50 VTI and VXUS. I believe in global diversification. The US has done very well lately, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will continue to do well in the future. My investment strategy is basically to mimic the ETF VT. If US becomes a larger proportion of the global stock market, so will my portfolio. Basically what I am saying is that I don‚Äôt rebalance. I purchase ETFs every paycheck, and my strategy is just to buy to get myself closer to the VT proportion. VT is around 50/50 now, so I almost just alternate every paycheck buying VTI and VXUS. I don‚Äôt need to do anything large because as my ETFs move up and down in value, they are automatically moving towards my goal asset allocation, because my goal is a moving target. As well, my post-FIRE plans lead well to holding high amounts of VXUS as I want to have larger exposure to different currencies.

I didn‚Äôt change anything during the brief covid recession. Just kept plugging along.

Real estate is too much work for me. I don‚Äôt want to be a landlord. I don‚Äôt own the home I live in because I want to move often and 5 years isn‚Äôt enough for it to be worthwhile.

**Other ideas**

I‚Äôve toyed with just moving abroad now, and quitting my job and accepting a lower paycheck. That might happen if someday I just can‚Äôt hold on any longer. It would be hard for me to take a lower paycheck at this time, maybe if I had a larger NW. I love where I live but I also want to see the world and live abroad.

I‚Äôve toyed with finding a different job that is lower stress, but I‚Äôm not sure it exists at this compensation range in my profession. I also enjoy that my hours are reasonable at my job. Sometimes I miss the days of 2015 where I made 70k a year and had no real responsibility. I worked slightly more hours back then, but I wasn‚Äôt the one who was ultimately responsible, and my work stress was significantly less. But I‚Äôd rather work 5 more years at 250k than 15 more at 70k.

I don‚Äôt have a networth tracker. Sorry! I have no idea. They‚Äôd be guesses.

**Summary**

That‚Äôs it. Feel free to AMA. I was a little bit afraid to make this post because I didn't want to just be another ""High income earner reaching FIRE at a young age"" post, but I think the other aspects of my situation hopefully make things more interesting. I definitely recognize rationally that I've had a fortunate upbringing and am lucky to be here.

FIRE can't control your life. Easier said than done, but I know what I need to do. I need to do things to make my daily life happier, stop daydreaming about retirement, and just be happy. I will only have my 30s once.

Also - therapy is amazing. If you tried it before and didn't like it, try it again with a different therapist! Took me 3 or 4 to find one that clicked.",489.0,financialindependence

This seems to be on a lot of people's minds these days in this community.  I have heard and read a lot recently that if your portfolio cannot handle a 30 percent drop, you are not ready to RE.  Is this 30 percent being thrown around for any specific reason other than it is close to what just happened in the markets?  Before COVID-19, rarely if ever was the FIRE community posting these recommendations.  This for me is a great prep/case study time period to ensure when I pull the RE trigger, I definitely have a cushion.

Main question:  Why 30 percent cushion, why not 50 or 15?  Is there any data around this or just a nice sounding padded number (30)?",343.0,financialindependence

At my current rate of saving, I could have my house paid off by 41 and FIRE at 47, but I like my job.

A combination of three things is making me consider taking a year off retirement investing. First, I have a toddler who *loves* to be outside, and a second kid on the way. Second, we've been largely quarantined for 3 months now. And these two lead to my third: I really want to invest in our backyard and make it a really nice place to spend time.

I'm not yet maxing out my 401k investment annually, but if I reduce my 401k investment to just the amount my company matches, that adds around $3k in 2021 to our cash balance. Add in $12,000 not going to Roth IRA accounts and the ~$1500/month extra we have for general savings or investing and we could knock out a ton of outdoor living improvements next year. Right now, we have a fence that's falling over and an open lawn with no shade such that afternoons and evenings (until the sun completely goes down) are miserable.

What I'm wondering is, from your perspective, is losing that year acceptable? I'm really torn on it. On the one hand, we're going to live in this house the rest of our lives, our kid (and from what I can tell, all kids) loves to be outside, and we would benefit from being able to really enjoy our yard more and sooner.

On the other hand, it's not the financially responsible decision. I can't really figure out how much taking 2021 off from retirement savings would decrease our net worth at retirement... but it kind of looks like, if all I did was meet my company's match and leave our Roth IRA to appreciate for the rest of my working life, we'd still probably have more than we need. Resuming regular retirement savings in 2022 should jump us back up to likely having more than we need.

So I made a post about a year ago that was received well and I figured, since I hit my 3 year work anniversary today at 26, now would be a good time to do another update.  [u/RuSHiinIDaYLiTe](https://www.reddit.com/user/RuSHiinIDaYLiTe/)  also made a similar post recently which inspired me to do mine.

2020 has been a historical year. With the coronavirus, job losses and the stock market crash, we certainly witnessed some life changing events. The market crash was the first one I have ever experienced and it was wild seeing 10%+ drops in a single day.  But I knew this was what I signed up for and I stayed the course. Luckily, I remained employed throughout the year, which was a good reminder why I chose to pursue engineering in medical devices. I even negotiated a 7% raise in March which really helped me invest aggressively. As the stock market recovered, I couldn't help but feel guilty seeing my portfolio soar while others were getting laid off. It's a good reminder to never take your job for granted. This was a good experience to have, as I sometimes dread coming into work.

Onto the financials...

I started 2020 with about $42k net worth, which was made up of $9k in cash, $38k invested and $5k on my credit cards. My cc balance is never this high but I splurged on a watch at the end of 2019 to celebrate my success. I always pay my cc in full every month. Throughout the year I have been on track to max my retirement accounts for the first time while also saving additional cash on the side. This is challenging to do as I decided to go all Roth for my 401(k) and IRA. Many people have asked why I do all Roth and simply I just want to pay taxes now and be done with it. Tax-free growth is awesome, I can afford to do it, I don't know what tax bracket I'll be in during retirement and I don't know what tax rates will be in the future. I am totally fine locking in my current tax rate. I also like looking at my account balances and knowing that (almost) every dollar is mine (with the exception of employer matched funds).

Today I hit my 3 year work anniversary and am now fully vested in my 401(k), which locked in about $4k in assets. My current net worth is sitting over $80k at 26. It almost doesn't feel any different than $40k. This is because I have that FIRE mindset where I'm always living below my means and saving saving saving. My lifestyle never changes. To break down my assets, I have about $16k in my IRA, $49k in my 401(k) and $18k in cash. My net worth is now greater than my gross base salary. This progress feels great. While I don't have a lot of money, I certainly am beginning to feel more free. It's a nice taste of financial independence. Just knowing that if I lose my job I'll be totally fine is a great feeling.

So if we zoom out 3 years, I was in a much different place. I basically had no assets and $74k in debt. My parents did pay about a third of my debt and allowed me to live at home until I paid the rest off so that was a HUGE help. So in three years I was able to increase my net worth by about $154k and that was while compound interest was working against me! I can only imagine how powerful compound interest will start working for me as I reach $100k, $200k net worth and so on. The crazy part about this progress is that I am not depriving myself. I live on $1680 per month and that includes $300 to spend on whatever I want. Sometimes I bend the rules, like last month I bought a gaming laptop just because I felt like it. I don't feel bad about purchases when I have assets. But I am really able to live well on about $20k per year.

What are my goals? Well I still really want to buy a house. My fiancee and I saved up about $23k in cash combined. I'm thinking we'll need at least $50k to cover a downpayment, closing costs and a 6 month emergency fund. We are in no rush to buy a house and want to make sure that we set ourselves up for financial success before we settle down on a property. I am really excited to hit $100k net worth. If the market stays stable I think I could do it before the end of the year. If the market crashes again, so be it. My strategy won't change.

That's all I got! Thanks for reading and feel free to ask me any questions or share your progress. Happy Friday.

I was just thinking about my own family and thought it'd be an interesting case study to help us better understand other's perspectives.

&#x200B;

Background: One parent is from well off-ish family (by the time I was born the wealth was more of a memory than a reality for the vast majority of this side). One parent is from a war torn third world country and moved to the US as a teen with very little support. We (siblings and I) grew up in a middle class to upper middle class town with good public schools, low crime, and mostly professional families. Our parents emphasized educational achievement (probably too much), provided an above average financial education, and demanded obedience. Offered to pay what they could for college.

&#x200B;

Parent 1 ended up a semi-disabled drug addict who lost control of their severe mental health issues and became abusive towards everyone in the family. Parent 2 ignored/tolerated/enabled this behavior from the time I was in elementary school until parent 1 died of an accidental overdose when we were all adults. Just hoping to point out that it we had some advantages and some disadvantages, like most people.

&#x200B;

Sibling 1:

Likely inherited some of the family mental illness and also bore the brunt of parental abuse. Kicked out of the house as a minor, but parents still supported financially as they lived with relatives and finished high school. Graduated at the height of the financial crisis of 08 and their college fund, which was still invested, took a major hit. They enrolled in an out of state public school, did very poorly three semesters in a row, and transferred to a less expensive school once the college money ran out. Continued to struggle in school until dropping out after 6 years and working odd jobs with a lot of student loan debt ($40k). Grew up a bit, learned some independence, and returned to school to finish up a degree after a few years. Currently working in a semi-related field making decent money ($45k), working on getting the loans down ($20k today), and saving up for a house in a LCOL area. Current NW \~-15k. Lessons to be learned: college isn't right for every person right out of high school, addressing mental health and previous trauma is really important to moving forward, and you can totally make mistakes early in life and turn it around.

&#x200B;

Sibling 2:

After sibling 1 was kicked out, parental abuse turned towards sibling 2 who dealt with it by working enough to support themselves and then heading off to college on a full ride, disconnecting from family (probably a good decision). Started roth IRA in high school and has always been a saver. Decided to go to expensive professional school funded by a now more robust college fund (having grown for several more years in a bull market), scholarships, and working. Graduated with significant debt but also married a high earner and all debt was paid off within 2 years. Currently in training making about $60k with pay expected to increase significantly after training is complete. Current NW \~$150k.  Lessons to be learned: sometimes success is found by removing the things that hinder you. The right spouse can really help FIRE move along!

&#x200B;

Sibling 3:

Largely ignored by parents. Went to in state college on a 50% scholarship, some covered by parents, some loans taken out ($20k total). Turned out to be very good at math, completed a bachelors and paid off masters before moving into corporate job making \~$85k. Paid off student loans quickly and was saving good money but also fell into life style inflation and some vices that had a negative effect on work. Also had some mental health issues to work out and was generally pretty unhappy in life. Recently decided to quit corporate and go back to school for a PhD with the hope of staying in academia. Current NW \~$80k (expected to go down through grad school as stipend is very low!). Lessons to learn: While NW is relatively low, it was enough for a single young person to essentially say ""FU"" to work and pursue something new.  Money doesn't give you happiness but it does give you choices and hopefully you can choose to pursue the life you want.

Have any of you similarly seen really divergent financial lives from people with similar backgrounds? How has your family/community shaped your FIRE journey? What have you seen to be people's biggest obstacles in reaching their ideal life (whether that involves FIRE or not)?

I‚Äôm a gym owner who is currently closed due to the pandemic. 

Pre-pandemic, my wife and I were bringing in $300k per year, for the last couple of years, through our gym (training). I have steadily grown my salary from $100k, over the past ten years. This did not come without cost; it cost me my sanity and almost cost our marriage. Quite frankly, anxiety and an unhealthy obsession with earning more is what pushed me to that income (my wife joined me as part of the business a few years ago). The day before the pandemic hit, I was on the verge of my tenth mental breakdown. 

We have just over $1 million in index funds. 
We have three years of living expenses saved. 

I understand I can most likely coast. If $1 million doubled in ten years, we could coast until then and reevaluate/FIRE. 

My dilemma is a mental one. Even in the current climate, once we can reopen, if I cut to part time, I can bring in far more income than I could if I started a new profession and worked 40 hours per week. We live in a low coast of living area. My wife could also go get a part time job and we can cover living expenses together. 

Problem is, I feel like a failure. I busted my ass for so many years to earn more and more and I feel my worth as a person comes from that success. Going backwards in salary makes me feel like I‚Äôm losing. The back of my mind says, ‚Äúwhen you can reopen, bust your ass again and get your salary back up over the next couple of years. Earn big for five+ years and then fire early‚Äù.

231,I made a simple Google Sheet to compare a traditional loan repayment vs. a more aggressive strategy on interest,,703.0,hu3arf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hu3arf/i_made_a_simple_google_sheet_to_compare_a/,1595176246.0,"Hello!

First time posting yada yada...

Here's the link to the sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUzVIX7V36MLnB4AESlV0Vd-bUHxO87JYTNQzJTHt4o/edit?usp=sharing

You'll have to make a copy of it in your drive in order to make changes. Only edit the fields in yellow that are in the middle.

In the example that's on there, an individual has $60,000 in a loan (perhaps a student loan) with 6% interest and a 20 year term.

By making a lump sum payment of $6000 they have in a savings account from working throughout college, and then deciding to put another $150 towards their loan each month, the sheet gives you a summary of what you'd be saving in this scenario.

In this case: - Saving ~$20,000 in interest - Paying off their loan in 11.8 years instead of 20.

This is a pretty primitive sheet that isn't really programmed to fit every conceivable situation. It's also not the most user friendly if you aren't familiar with using spreadsheets.

I'd love to hear if it helps you in any way, or what you think could be done to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.

232,Oversaving in a 529 is a much smaller problem than you would think,,701.0,hqexle,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hqexle/oversaving_in_a_529_is_a_much_smaller_problem/,1594645658.0,"It's a discussion we have periodically - some people are paranoid about the penalties if you oversave in a 529 and then it turns out your kid doesn't go to college, or goes to a cheap college, or any other circumstance you don't need some or all of the money for education. So they advocate for saving in a taxable account instead. 

What are the differences? Well, there's two big ones. Some states offer a tax credit for 529s, though many don't. In addition, in a taxable account, you have tax drag on dividends, and in a 529 you don't. I wanted to see exactly how big the difference was between the final, post-tax amounts, for the two accounts in the scenarios when 0%, 33%, and 100% of the saved amount was qualified expenses. Math is run just for a few representative west coast states. NV/WA stand in for states without an income tax. AZ and OR have moderate and high state income tax respectively - with a small tax credit that somewhat makes up for it. CA has no tax credit, high income tax, and an extra penalty for non-qualified distributions.

Assumptions here:

1) We have a high-earning couple (I picked tax brackets for a couple earning ~$200k, as that's not *that* unusual on this sub) that maxes out all other tax-advantaged accounts, thus the only options for college savings are 529 or a taxable account

2) They save $10k/year at the beginning of the year from birth until age 18. For states that offer a tax break/tax credit, our enterprising couple puts the full amount of the tax credit into the 529 along with the $10k (that is, if given a $300 credit, they put $10,300 in each year). I picked this as a fairly large # so that differences would be easier to see - but proportionally the biggest benefit to the 529 is actually going to be just enough to max the state tax credit ($4000 for AZ, $6000 for OR). For states without a tax credit, it is identical proportional benefit no matter the contribution as long as the tax brackets don't change.

3) Growth is 7%/year of which 2% is dividends. In the taxable account, dividends are taxed at 15% plus their state tax bracket. In the 529, dividends are untaxed.

4) Penalties on non-qualified withdrawals are the income tax rate plus 10% in every state except CA - which adds an extra 2.5%.

5) It's assumed that tax brackets are unchanged in real terms moving forward. Obviously this likely won't be the case for the next 18 years - but how that affects capital gains vs income taxes on state and federal levels is anyones guess.

6) To make the math easier, I ignored the growth from age 18 till the end of withdrawal, with the assumption that all of balance would be withdrawn at the current marginal tax rate and given to the kid regardless during/after that period.

All numbers in thousands (except the tax break, which is really just $180 or $300)

||Tax savings up front from $10k/year contribution|Capital Gains Tax Rate (fed+state) for couple making $200k|Marginal Income Tax Rate|Balance in 529 after 18 years|Balance in taxable account after 18 years|Post-tax taxable amount|529 if everything is penalized|529 if a third is penalized|What % must be qualified for 529 to equal taxable account|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|NV/WA|$0|15%|24.00%|$363.79|$352.49|$334.85|$301.30|$342.96|54%|
|AZ|$180|19.24%|28.24%|$370.34|$349.36|$327.28|$298.79|$346.49|40%|
|OR|$300|24.90%|33.90%|$374.70|$345.24|$317.57|$291.60|$347.00|31%|
|CA|$0|24.30%|33.30%|$363.79|$345.67|$318.58|$279.61|$335.73|46%|

So to read the table, our couple saves $363-$375k in a 529 or $345-$352k in a taxable account, with the biggest difference being the tax drag in the taxable account. But post-tax, the taxable accounts only contain $317-$334k - due to capital gains taxes. The full 529 balance is available for education. But what about if it's withdrawn entirely for non-education reasons? Well, after taxes and penalties, it's only 
worth $279-301k. But even if only two thirds of the 529 money is used for educational expenses - in all cases, it's more final post-tax money than the taxable account. In fact, with some simple algebra, we can derive that as little of 31-54% of the pot of money being used for a qualified expense is enough for the 529 to beat the taxable account overall.

So is it better to not oversave in the 529? Absolutely. It's better to have the exact right amount in the 529, not have to pull any from taxable, and put all the extra in taxable. But if there's even a 50/50 chance that you're undersaving, the math works out that it's better to have that extra dollar for the kid in a 529 than a taxable account. The benefits of the loss of tax drag are just that important.

And yes, even if you *completely* oversave in this scenario and use *none* of the money for qualified expenses - you might lose ~10% of the overall balance (taking into account both benefits and penalties) - but I think the potential 10-15% benefit (if it's all qualified) outweigh that risk.

Note: I made a copy of the spreadsheet I used to generate the above [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10HRCc8Ggg1ai6gFtZiLCWeBC8WAz93svqW083LZDyoI/edit?usp=sharing). You're welcome to download it and use the generalizable calculator for your own scenarios, including lower tax rates and contribution #s. Outside of the tax credits, the 529 benefits tend to be much smaller for people who aren't fairly high earners, especially if your capital gains tax rate is 0. Honestly, if someone is in the 0% capital gains tax bracket, I don't think 529 contributions higher than enough to earn any applicable state credits would be worth it.

Edit: streamlined the table a bit to try to make it more likely to fit.

Edit 2: Major hat tip to /u/App1eEater who [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hqexle/oversaving_in_a_529_is_a_much_smaller_problem/fxzuuvv/?context=3) that I over-estimated the penalties for the 529 if the distributions are paid directly to the beneficiary - the penalties in that scenario are assessed at *the childs* income tax rate, not the parents. That makes the 529 an even better deal! I'm not redoing the spreadsheet to take that into account now (too much work), but yeah... it basically means the taxable account almost always loses, and it loses badly.",240.0,financialindependence

So I guess it's true that people's assests haven't turned into toilet paper or worse. But now that the funds may have different managers, the investment approach could become very different. Mangagement costs may increase. So the risk is there but more hidden.


Sadly, the remaining global broad market ETFs in Hong Kong have very low volume and small in size.  IMO that's a higher risk. You would feel sad that investors in the city have not much options for global broad market ETFs.

I understand the importance of having an emergency fund in something that won't lose value when your net worth is on the lower end, but what about once you've grown your net worth? If you have **years** worth of expenses invested in something like VTSAX, does it still make sense to keep 3+ months of living expenses in a savings account? 

Even with a market down turn, you'd still have access to several months worth of expenses if you initially had years worth invested.

I put myself through nursing school (my second degree), both paid for in cash and have been a Nurse for two years now. I have barely six figures in savings (large majority in retirement). Ive never had any debt and my goal is to be financially independent by 35. Its really just an arbitrary number at this point but Ill explain.

Paying cash for both degrees was because I never even saw loans as an option I would accept. And I worked my fucking ass off to do it. I live off of $24k a year and the rest is in investments. In May of this year I quit my full time critical care, HIGH STRESS but high paying job. I landed a part time position at my previous employer but took a massive pay cut to do it. But still make more than enough. 

This year has destroyed me. Emotionally and mentally. Im just so fucking done. My plan was to just ""tough it out"" at the hospital for a few more years (the high stress job I quit) because the money was good. But your girl is tired! Ive worked so hard to put myself in the situation that Im in. Being able to tell the job I hate to fuck off because I can was the most powerful feeling in the world. 

Now, Im living a much more manageable lifestyle (stress wise) but the money will not get me to FIRE by 35. Part of me thinks that I deserve to lay low right now, I earned it. The other part of me hates myself because Im just being a princess and not wanting to bust my ass anymore. But isnt that what FIRE is all about as well? 

Ive seen some seriously fucked up shit in the hospital. And every time I did it would make me want to quit even more. Not because I couldnt ""handle"" it but because I knew I didnt need the money so why was I even working a job I fucking hate when Im not even guaranteed tomorrow. 

I seriously thought nursing would help my FIRE but now I just want to live my life how I want NOW. And not in however long it takes me to get there.

238,Building a machine instead of a stash,,658.0,ioftu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ioftu1/building_a_machine_instead_of_a_stash/,1599511858.0,"*\*or, on top of a stash.*

**The Idea:** Build a business you can walk away from. 

**The Context:** My wife and I run a small marketing business that makes $200k per year. Our profit margin is \~70%, and we pay ourselves $50k/yr each. I also have a FT role ($75k) with a startup. We spend $50k, but our FIRE goal is to be able to sustain $75k per year. With 2 little kids, our goal isn't necessarily to build up as much as possible and then retire completely. It's to optimize our time so we get as much time with them as possible. 

**The Breakdown:**

With our current numbers, it would take \~9 years to invest enough to sustain $75k/yr. OR we could take the next 2 years to get our business to the point where it can support 75% of the salary at 25% of the effort (\~15 hrs per week). 

It would take *a lot* to get there: systems, training, higher pay, and hiring a full time employee to act as an account manager. But I believe we could get there in 18-24 months. And, since I have my startup salary, we could still continue to build our stash. 

**The Upshot:** It would mean a much lower profit margin, but also a much lower time investment after the next couple of years.

* What are the cons to this approach I may not be considering?

&#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow!

Always a pleasure reading the many success stories, overcame struggles, and humble journeys many of you have shared in this space. I‚Äôll try to keep my story short and hope I can pick the brains of the much more experienced of you all to find a path towards some peace. 

A few days back while scrolling through reddit I run into an imagine/story of your typical firer/rational low key frills family: went to work, spend below their means, and saved. Their net-worth got pretty nice and then Cancer hit one of the partners. Everything they built in years evaporated in months. Obviously this was in the US where despite having insurance, medical costs can still bankrupt you. I‚Äôve experienced Something similar through the eyes of a close friend. 

I grew up low income, with an overcrowded house hosting multiple families and earning minimum wage. Through great family support, relationships outside of my own and a bit of luck I managed to finish school and found myself in a corporate white collar job. Since growing up living paycheck to paycheck and making the best of resources, one of the core principles of fire (keeping expenses low) wasn‚Äôt really that new to me. I already knew how to live next to nothing (by force), I just didn‚Äôt know what to do with all the savings. 

Anyway, I am thankful and have found myself, and despite Covid, still with a job and saving quite a bit of money. Through your readings and advice, there is no doubt that I will fire. However, I absolutely still have no safety net. Medical costs still give me nightmares and despite living a rather healthy life, I know illness does not discriminate. 

My question, for all you firers that have your budgets, your savings goals, etc and are now in great position, what are you doing to protect your assets in the rare case that unfortunate event happens?  How do you survive (financially) after creditors from the likes of healthcare (or some other creditor outside of regular banking) come after your assets?

*edit:  hi y‚Äôall!  Thank you, thank you very much. I received more than enough humble and honest thoughts and experiences to continue this journey towards freedom. I am sorry if I did not respond to each one of you directly, I‚Äôm still going through them and getting your insights.

My father stems from a rather poor background and has worked his way up into top management positions where he earns a good amount of money. When I was young, I was told about the 3 pillars of resource: time, energy and money and that typically the distribution between the three of these is like [this]( https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56daf4c8d51cd4224e4154cb/1512223112189-3SEJUE00E67E1G0IGVLF/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOzBS1jDzJRmQA5ayDq8yKVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpy_OAb7JUX4sJCa2e92dI3SvXmXhM-ok4srFAMCgGvPeX1Dni_gz0JFjTcE6aKcZ_0/url.jpg.jpg?format=500w) and the challenge is to crack this seamlessly endless cycle by having enough of the ‚Äúenabler-resource‚Äù money early on in life. I‚Äôve had this mindset, this goal, as long as I can remember. I traded stuff in school, flipped Yu-Gi-Oh cards, got in to drop shipping, etc. Always with the idea of earning more money in the back of my head. It seems every life decision I‚Äôve made is focused on this topic, of course up to my career path (currently M22 studying engineering and management in Germany). Now with everything I‚Äôve done I made a decent amount of money pre-Covid and was lucky enough to know a few people in order to capitalize on the Covid-situation by supplying PPE from china. Covid didn‚Äôt only help me make money but also gave me some time to sit back and think for a minute. It occurred to me that I never knew what I would do if I would actually break the resource-pillar-cycle and had some money at a young age. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm rich and I'm obviously still far away from financial independence but I‚Äôm comfortably sitting on about 250k‚Ç¨ cash. 

So, I guess my actual question is: what does it mean to live? What do people do with their time and energy? Along this process I‚Äôve never really had any fun in what I was doing. I always thought the fun part would follow later on. To be honest I don‚Äôt even know what I like or what my interests are. It‚Äôs amazing to me when I talk to people that are genuinely passionate about something, no matter what that is. I don‚Äôt have that kind of passion or eagerness for anything really. I literally hate spending time with myself. When I‚Äôm not working on anything I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and just watch stupid YouTube videos or something else to try and pass the time.  

I guess this is more of a stupid rant than anything else but maybe someone can help me out somehow.

I‚Äôm curious as to everyone‚Äôs feedback on this idea because it seems to combine the two things typically advised against the most: taking money from your 401k and paying off your mortgage. 

The author proposes using the latest 401k tax adjustments from the CARES Act that waives the 10% early withdrawal fee, but also claims it would be savvy even with the fee.

Do these rules continue to hold strong and this is a doubly bad idea or would unprecedented current events make you reconsider?

I thought this was relevant to FI because housing costs are typically the primary concern for many. If paying off a mortgage earlier rather than later allows you to focus on additional savings and financial independence, is it worth it? Especially if you plan to stay in the same house for the next 10+ years and have another 20 or more left in your career. Personally if our mortgage were $500 a month, we would have a lot of freedom to decide what comes next and not necessarily take the highest paying job.

Under the act, loan limits have doubled from $50k or 50% of vested balance (whichever is lower) to $100,000 or 100% of your account balance (whichever is lower) total without the 10% early-withdrawal penalty. 

I am by no means an expert on how the CARES Act work, but there appears to be two kinds of applicable benefits in terms of your 401k:

1) Withdrawal - under the act, you don‚Äôt pay the 10% penalty normal to individuals under 59 1/2. Additionally if you replace the money within 3 years, you are able to recover the federal and state income taxes that apply to the withdrawal according to the American Retirement Association.

2) Loan - To qualify, the loan must be made within 180 days after the act was passed. The participant won‚Äôt owe income tax on the amount borrowed from the 401k if it‚Äôs paid back within 5 years according to the American Retirement Association.",267.0,financialindependence

My thoughts on each brokerage I looked at are below.

tl;dr: I don‚Äôt want to pay the fees, and I‚Äôm just going to keep Bogling it up with my two-fund portfolio

#Personal Capital
I‚Äôd been ignoring Personal Capital‚Äôs calls for years, but accidentally answered recently thinking it was a call regarding my mortgage refinance. I thought ‚Äúwhat do I have to lose‚Äù and scheduled two sessions with their advisor.

**Fees and minimums**

Minimum investment $100k.  
Very steep expense ratio of 0.89%, dropping to 0.79% when you hold over $1MM with them. Honestly, you can stop reading here and scroll to the next section.

**Automation**

At the time of my call, I was in the middle of shuffling some money around and had $10k in cash, plus some RSUs I hadn‚Äôt yet sold and indexed, and they spent a while saying that one of the benefits of using their service is handling that sort of thing automatically. I can‚Äôt imagine an extra couple weeks of ‚Äútime in the market‚Äù would beat their ongoing expense ratio.

**Allocations**

All of the below is for my risk level, a lower risk portfolio will be different.

They suggested 70/30 US/International, I currently have 67/33. I rebalance via my contributions, but they‚Äôd be rebalancing in the traditional sense, which of course becomes more important when you‚Äôre out of the accumulation stage.

Instead of tracking the total market, they target an even split between Value/Core/Growth, with 40% allocation to mid and small caps. They pick about 90 stocks, and it seems that they use index ETFs for the small cap portion.

I‚Äôm not sure the small cap premium still exists, and this seems like a lot of extra work to diversify. They didn‚Äôt send over any backtesting showing this beating the market.

They recommended 10% to various alternatives.  
This would be buying some REITs, allocating 1.5% of my portfolio to gold, some other metals, etc. I‚Äôm a big gold skeptic, but I can‚Äôt imagine 1.5% would make or break anything. I might take a second look at REITs in my tax advantaged accounts, but I likely won‚Äôt purchase any, as I get enough exposure to real estate via VTI and through simply owning my house.

**Performance**

They say your annual return can be enhanced by up to 4.89%, but 1.5% is behavioral coaching, 0.2% is disciplined rebalancing, 1% is tax optimization, and 0.39% is smart weighting. If you‚Äôre a typical retail investor in need of a bit of behavioral coaching that‚Äôs one thing, but for the average person here these numbers are less attractive. 

**Smart Weighting**

Instead of tracking the total market, they target equally allocating 10% each to ten different sectors (tech, energy, healthcare, etc). They show the ‚Äúperiodic table of US sector returns‚Äù showing how different sectors over/underperform the market in different years, and how rebalancing to maintain an equal weighting between sectors captures gains and buys stocks when they‚Äôre low. They show some backtesting showing a 0.7% increase in annual returns, with a 0.8% decrease in standard decimation since 1990.

Their reasoning for rebalancing makes sense, but obviously doesn‚Äôt overcome their 0.89% fee. 
However, it makes me consider funds like the Russell 1000 equal weight ETF (EQAL) which has a 0.20% ER. Since it‚Äôs inception in 2015, however, EQAL has had less than half the inflation-adjusted return of VTI.

I‚Äôm wondering what the problems with this methodology are in theory. Too many realized gains when rebalancing? The additional bookkeeping needed to keep track and the fees associated with that? Or just that sectors naturally aren‚Äôt equal, and we shouldn‚Äôt expect the same growth from each one? Comments certainly welcome.

Ultimately, I think I‚Äôll stay the course with good old VTI/VXUS.

**Tax management**

Tax efficient asset allocation, not picking mutual funds with high turnover, and performing tax loss harvesting. Already doing my best to do all of these. I‚Äôm rather concerned about taxes with the frequent rebalancing, so I‚Äôm not sure I think I‚Äôd get much alpha here from the automated TLH.

**Other**

They have one of the highest average balances when you look at their AUM divided by number of users, around a half million per user, meaning the average user is paying around $4k a year for this service. No wonder their budgeting software is free.

#Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium
I‚Äôve been a Schwab client for a long time, originally due to their no-fee bank account, and now the simplicity of having my bank account and brokerage under one roof. They offer low (but not zero) fee index funds. I currently do not subscribe to their paid service

**Fees/Minimums**

Flat fee of $300, plus $30/month.  
Beats Personal Capital at $40k invested, Wealthfront at $144k, so definitely a cheaper option for people on their way to FI. Of course, you pay the ETF fees as well

Minimum $25k invested, tax loss harvesting starts at $50k
Comes with access to certified financial planner, automatic rebalancing, tax loss harvesting

EDIT: /u/veezbo pointed out that their non-premium version is free which is even better than a flat fee, but the below points on performance still stand.

**Allocations and performance**

You need a minimum 6% cash allocation, which seems insanely high to me.

They offer a few portfolios, but I‚Äôll compare to their ‚Äúglobal aggressive growth‚Äù since that seems the closest to my 2-fund strategy

This uses 94% stocks, 6% cash, and has had a [3.67% annualized return since inception on 3/31/15 to 6/30/2020](https://content.schwab.com/intelligent-portfolios/historical-performance/)

I can‚Äôt tell if Schwab‚Äôs number is before or after inflation, but they seem to have missed out an a lot of the bull market‚Äôs growth. Past performance blah blah blah, but that‚Äôs not great for an ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù 94% stock portfolio. Don‚Äôt see any data on volatility.

**Tax loss harvesting**

Primary and alternate ETF, rebalanced when over a certain threshold. This is what I‚Äôve been doing manually this whole time.

**Summary**

While I like the flat fees, their poor performance and high cash allocation means if you‚Äôve got $1MM with them, you‚Äôve got a whole $60k doing nothing, and $940k in a strategy that‚Äôs underperformed the market. Not great.

#Wealthfront
As a math nerd, I greatly appreciate the [data Wealthfront publishes regarding their methodologies.](https://www.wealthfront.com/methodology)

**Fees and minimums**

0.25%, plus fund fees of 0.06%-0.13%.  
$500 minimum, but more to qualify for some of their services that matter.

**Tax management**

Stock level tax loss harvesting starts at $100k invested, but surprisingly doesn‚Äôt seem to outperform ETF-level tax loss harvesting by much. Some comments on Bogleheads mention that this makes it very difficult to untangle your portfolio when you‚Äôre selling off or moving away from Wealthfront. If you have >$1MM invested, you could have your portfolio spread across 1000 individual stocks.

It looks like you can exclude certain companies from this stock level TLH, which is useful for those of us who get stock compensation from our employers. They advertise it as a way to do socially responsible investing.

**Allocations**

At $500k invested, Wealthfront offers the ability to index by risk factors instead of market cap. I‚Äôll let their whitepaper in the link above speak for itself, but it seems to have had higher returns than VTI when backtested back to 2000, but lower returns since they started this service in 2017. Looking at figure 2 in their paper, the year 2000 is right before a period where their strategy has its highest overperformance, so backtesting to different dates may show lower performance.

For those of you with a bond allocation, they offer a ‚Äúrisk parity‚Äù service for a fee, where leverage is used to match the standard deviation of a specific stock/bond allocation, but with volatility evenly spread between asset classes. Their explanation makes sense, but using leverage to buy bonds makes me uncomfortable for reasons I don‚Äôt have enough of a grasp on economics to explain. Not sure if there exists a Monte Carlo tool that can easily test this strategy to see if the failure rate for a certain WR changes, as I‚Äôm less concerned about average return here, and more concerned about risk of ruin. I‚Äôd be concerned that a matched standard deviation might not necessarily match kurtosis, and you might wind up a small risk of a large failure. They don‚Äôt allow you to put more than 20% into this strategy, so maybe my paranoia is justified?

I‚Äôd appreciate comments on these methodologies from someone who‚Äôs more familiar with the academic works referenced in their whitepapers.

Edit: /u/internet-poster's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jswrdq/an_informal_review_of_several_robo_advisors_from/gc3djxw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) shows just how terribly Wealthfront's strategy performed during the pandemic.

**Other**

Doesn‚Äôt take outside holdings like your 401k into account like Personal Capital might, so you‚Äôll have to keep the big picture in mind yourself.

As a millennial, the only thing I dislike more than the negative millennial stereotypes is pandering to millennials. Their site describes their service as ‚Äúrobo-investing for millennials‚Äù or the even-more-irritating ‚Äúself-driving money‚Ñ¢‚Äù and they‚Äôve portrayed us as a bunch of [brunch-addled shoe photographers.](https://imgur.com/a/rOMmmUo)

#Betterment
Charges the same 0.25% fee as Wealthfront or 0.40% if you want to have support from real live humans. 0.10% discount on the balance over $2MM. Offers the choice of a socially responsible portfolio and helps you donate appreciated shares to charity.

Only has half of what Wealthfront offers, and doesn‚Äôt seem writing more about. Skip the fees and handle your own donations.

#Vanguard Personal Advisor Services
Nearly forgot about this one, despite being very happy with my IRA at Vanguard.

Minimum $50k, 0.30% fee on balances below $5M with lower fees at higher balances.

Seems to be mostly advice (it‚Äôs in the name) and rebalancing. Not worth it for me.

From what I can tell, they don‚Äôt directly TLH, but you can opt-in to a ‚Äúmintax‚Äù accounting method that sells lots with the biggest losses first and the largest short-term gains last. Review over.

You can also choose a ‚Äúdigital advisor‚Äù for a 0.15% fee. Seems to be just a 4-fund portfolio, plus access to some online calculators/tracking tools.",186.0,financialindependence

The idea is that clever building design, preferably using recycled materials, can keep utility bills near zero and lower food bills as well. All it takes is land, southern exposure, time, and lax building codes (or a disregard for stricter ones).

It's a form of homesteading, but in a way that to me seems to encourage working smarter rather than harder.

I also wanted to know if others where having similar issues.  For context, I‚Äôm a 33 year old male. I‚Äôm having trouble talking to people about money in the last few years.  Even writing this it sounds like a giant first world, humble brag of a post.  This stuff has been bother me a lot lately, since I feel like it‚Äôs a growing divide with the core people in my life.  Around the time I hit the 200k and we all began hitting 30s it‚Äôs like something switched with my friends and I.  We have been tight since high school, and I can talk to them about anything.  They can talk to me about anything.  Essential I feel like an elitist.  There are two reasons why. When my friends and I talk about money, they say I just don‚Äôt understand their problems.  The other one is probably my problem:  when I talk about $1,000 I talk about it like they would talk about $20.

I get their money problems and half the time I‚Äôve been the one to point out the solution (cheapest way to do something, how credit vehicles work, or refinance routes), but somehow when it comes to me trying to talk through a monetary issue they just say ‚Äúyou got money‚Äù.  It annoys me to no end.  The reason I have money is I pay myself first, and what is left is my budget.  My budget is $3k to spend a month, which is probably less then they do.  In my group, I‚Äôm probably the lowest earner if stock gains aren‚Äôt included (which aren‚Äôt ever took out of the market anyway).  How the hell to I get them to understand that I still have to adhere to a budget?!

My other issue is: I don‚Äôt really think about day to day spending anymore.  I mostly stick to 3k a month but I don‚Äôt feel a need to track my spending.  I‚Äôve gotten to the move in point with my gf and we were talking about budgets.  It‚Äôs been kinda frustrating, because we are coming from very different places.  She‚Äôs learned to live without certain things, while I‚Äôm learning it‚Äôs ok to enjoy some of my money on some luxuries.  I said off handily that if we couldn‚Äôt make initial budget work I could just kick in an extra $500 a month and she told me I can‚Äôt just act like $500 has little value because that is a lot of money to her. She‚Äôs earning $34k a year and hates talking money.  Despite that she‚Äôs great with money and an amazing saver.  If she had chased money instead of passion for a career I have no doubt she‚Äôd FIRE before me.  How do I talk about our budget in a way that‚Äôs comfortable for her, and reassure her that I view our income and spending as our money?  I can bring 2k-4k to the table for our monthly expenses, but to me the question is how does she want to live preFIRE not what our budget should be?

That‚Äôs my lame first world problem.  I feel ashamed of having money lately, and I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm acting like an asshole about it.  No one I know has a net worth over $100k including senior family members, so I don‚Äôt really have anyone in a comparable situation to ask.  The easy answer would be to stop talking about money, but the only reason I‚Äôm good with money is I‚Äôve been able to talk about it with the wonderful people in my life.  I‚Äôve adapted all their good habits and it‚Äôs got me this far.  What‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs experience?  Does anyone have any useful toss for talking money?

Edit:  you‚Äôll are the best!!! I‚Äôm taking away from this is I need to wait for them to ask for advice and stick to concepts not exact dollars.  I feel kinda dumb for not figuring that out on my own, but hey I‚Äôm good with the financials not the emotions.",313.0,financialindependence
251,26 Years 50% FIRE - small income country,,622.0,j0owcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j0owcs/26_years_50_fire_small_income_country/,1601202358.0,"So I am 26 years, from a small country in the EU. I work as a storekeeper in a factory, and used to be a cab driver part time for a fixed per hour wage. You expected to see Entrepreneur, YouTuber or Software Developer... right?

I still live with my parents and have very little expenses, apart from taxes, gym membership and car fuel. I've been into this Retire Early mindset since I was very young. Never really saw the point of working till you're old.

So I saved and invested 95% of my net income yearly. (We're talking 15k euros per year net wage).

By last year I had about 180k euros invested in mostly local equities. Then I decided to purchase an apartment for 180k Euros (included closing fees and was undervalued by at least 30k) with 50% Down payment and keeping the other 90k in equities. I rented it out for about 8k euros per year.

Now I decided to liquidate most of the equities to try and buy another apartment but the banks didn't like the idea so I decided to pay off all my mortgage instead. I now have a fully paid apartment which is now valued at 240k.

Currently I have zero debt. I have about 20k between cash / crypto / equities. For a total Net worth of about 260k.

My goal is to purchase another apartment and fully pay it by age 31 - which would also be my lucky birthday.

Upon reaching my goal I would have approx Euro 550k net worth at 31. This would give me about 15k euros passive income per year which is 50% more than the current minimum wage in my country of 10k Euro.

I would then semi retire to a point where all the passive income is completely reinvested. Then I would just relocate to a high income country in the EU working 60hour work weeks for 3 months and save everything. Also get refunded on tax because you don't reach the thresholds for income. Then have 9 months of traveling around in low cost countries around mountains, beaches and nature. I'll get a local media company to make an article on my odd successful life and start a YouTube channel documenting my journeys.

Repeat the process for a couple more years till YouTube earnings are enough so as to never need those 3months of work a year.

&#x200B;

Being able to work 3 months a year at the age of 31 is a dream for 99% of the people including myself, but it doesn't come without some disadvantages:-

1. I would have basically skipped a decade of my life. No travels, losing friends, little social life.
2. Most people don't understand your idea of freedom and life.
3. Finding a partner with the same ideology is going to be extremely hard.

However there is the advantage that I learned to be alone. Go out alone, especially in quiet and around nature. I set gym goals at the age of 16 and 10 years later I barely do any effort to look & feel better than most people. I expanded my knowledge by completing a Diploma in Nutrition, in insurance, in IT and in Personal Training. I also find more time to read books that I borrow from libraries to avoid purchasing anything. I don't have to keep updating my wardrobe, since I barely use most of them, they look brand new hehe ;)

&#x200B;

i didn't write this post to brag. I wrote it as a means of motivation for low income people. Yeah you're going to sacrifice basically everything for just a couple of goals. But hell, once you reach them the satisfaction will be huge.

5 Years away. Let's do this.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I see that a lot of people are posting regarding living off my parents. Well yeah. What's wrong with using all the opportunities at one's disposal to reach goals? In my country people tend to live with their parents until marriage anyway.

Also, my parents have always been frugal themselves, so them helping me to achieve my targets is giving them a lot of satisfaction, although I must say they do not agree with me Retiring Early. So much so, that my father is of age to retire and get government pension and just chooses to keep working because he enjoys work. Apart from the fact that my parents have investments themselves. Let's say that they don't need my help financially.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** Geez didn't expect this amount of engagement. Here's my replies to most Questions:

* Yes, yes, everyone saying how easy it is when you have your family pay for food and you have no rent. Sure it's great and can't help but appreciate what I have, but you're just saying that to undermine the effort I put in.   
I could have done like most of my colleagues and people my age in my country, which is go abroad 3 times a year, spend all money on cars / phones / clothes and so on and have zero net worth, even though most of them have similar opportunities.  
It's not easy to basically delay gratification for 10-15 years. People can't even go a week on a diet before buying an ice-cream and I am here with little social life, few hobbies, and just work, save and invest.


* You guys misunderstood the motivation part and are focusing only on the 95% savings rate, which might be unattainable to most. Well my aim was to tell people to Delay Gratification. Because if you can save 70% and are only saving 50% because you want to enjoy life today using those 20%, well then that is your fault. I can assure you I would much rather use 15% more of my income to have a life, but then I'd have to spend more hours working.. Sacrifice Today for Tomorrow. 


* As for the YouTube thing, well getting a local media company to write an article is relatively easy to do. Will the channel be successful? No idea, but since I would be traveling anyway, might as well just video places and upload to YouTube.. 3 years later something might happen. And to be honest, if I make 5k/year from ad revenue + affiliates it would literally replace the 3 month work / year


* For those who do not understand why I will still work 3 months / year instead of just using the rental income. Well I want to get a bigger net worth and more passive income in the future, therefore I will reinvest all the rent I get and just live/travel on the wages earned that year.


* As for those saying I am not diversified. Sure, but in my country due to limited land, basically house prices always went up or went down very little (in 2008-09, they lost 4% value). So it is a stable store of value along with a good passive income. In real estate you can also use leverage to make more gains, while investing solely in stocks and ETFs is not recommended to use margin. - Although I had amassed my net worth by investing in local stocks mostly.

I coach highschool wrestling, and do plenty of other stuff I enjoy, so it's not as though I'm not living life or anything. Yet it feels like I spend a potentially unhealthy amount of time thinking about the future. Thinking about future plans and goals for myself in 8-10 years when I've achieved FI.

It's not that I have no near-term goals for myself, it's just that a lot of my goals, like living overseas, just aren't feasible right.

I'm still in my early 30s with about $600K in net worth. Most of my net worth build was attributed to investing in the S&P 500 and appreciation of the home I currently live in.

In our case, it translates to the importance of setting goals after FI. 

""In my early years, I looked up to extraordinarily successful people, thinking that they were successful because they were extraordinary.

After I got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them - like me, like everyone - make mistakes, struggle with their weaknesses, and don't feel that they are particularly special or great.

They are no happier than the rest of us, and they struggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle than glory. This has certainly been true for me. While I surpassed my wildest dreams decades ago, I am still struggling today. In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. 

To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for. Just look at people who attain their dreams early - the child star, the lottery winner, the professional athlete who peaks early. They typically don't end up happy unless they get excited about something else bigger and better to struggle for. 

Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn't just make your ups better; it makes your downs less bad. I'm still struggling and I will until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.""

After years of diligent saving, I hit 4%...Then I read the Mad Fientist's post on SWR ([https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate](https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate)) and figured, ""ok...maybe 3.5% just to be safe.  After all, I could live another 60 years!""

As if you have any idea what that will feel like when the market crashes 60%, and then you go through the GFC and are like...""oh, so this is what risk feels like"".

It is my first time posting here and thank you everyone for the great insight into your FIRE's journeys! I  am currently evaluating if I should pursue a new job. At the moment I have a very easy job which I am at around \~90 thousands, but due to COVID will be now 4 days a week for \~70K.

The job is very easy, and gives me lots of flexibility. I have seen other jobs which can probably raise my salary to 100k, but I am inclined to take maybe this year to do some things I wanted and probably learn a few more skills. I am aware there is a big difference between 70k and 100k, but I am not sure if I might regret either: 1) Not pursuing a better income, or 2) The flexibility and peace of mind of an easy job.

Has any of you sacrificed your salary for convenience or vice versa? I'll be happy to hear any stories!",338.0,financialindependence
259,FI = nihilism?,,603.0,h0m5nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/h0m5nz/fi_nihilism/,1591828852.0,"So my brain has been making this connection recently and I'm trying to understand why. I remember forming the desire to be FI in my teenage years. But before that I remember believing in being good at something as in having a profession. By being confronted with the reality of the world one finds there isn't really anything worth doing other than that which leads to acquiring wealth and subsequently more freedom. In my case I especially don't have a desire of being wealthy but simply of not having to deal with work that I find meaningless. I guess maybe for people like doctors or scientists there is more meaning in what they do. I feel like choosing to become independently wealthy is downright nihilistic because on the deep level it says there is nothing worth doing in this world so I might as well live off my remaining time more comfortably.

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of FI and I'm working towards achieving it for myself but I can't help but feeling like I'd trade it off for a job worth doing.

EDIT: I might be a little messed up in the head. But I see how most agree that the important things in life aren't valued by society so we have to retreat into our little asinine corporate cubicle gigs which later accumulate into our FI nesteggs, which just equals to other people doing those asinine gigs for us, so then we can finally larp out our fantasies about how we think life should be.

To me, FI is admitting the system is broken, but instead trying to rebuild it, we're just buying ourselves a share in that system so we can get that sweet free ride.",189.0,financialindependence
260,three years into early retirement,,599.0,gwrfpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwrfpj/three_years_into_early_retirement/,1591308495.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Introduction**: As my desire to spend nearly an entire day on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. Please check comments and posts from my history to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I might no longer take the time to say so individually. I apologize if I don‚Äôt remember you individually. The usernames and stories run together. Please remind me of a discussion we had or provide a link if it‚Äôs relevant to something you want to know. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (portfolio plus home). My original model was a simple 3% withdrawal rate of the portfolio value. Our actual withdrawal rate has been much lower due to: occasionally earning additional income in 2017-2019; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and a retool of the model due to purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (more below). The maximum withdrawal amount allowed for 2020 is $5217/mo or $62,604/yr (3% of current net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We‚Äôre so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k). My parents initially promised to cover the remaining $90k of education expenses out of what they deemed to be pure principle, but we assumed the loan as part of the deal when purchasing their home at a reduced rate in 2019 (explanation upcoming). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average.

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents‚Äô home/farm, our net worth is closer to 55% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another with 66 acres) / 44% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 1% cash. We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), other inheritances ($???), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**YEAR THREE RECAP**

**Performance**: Living expenses for the third year came to $42,812 (max budget $62,604). We generated $9,514 of income this year primarily from my wife‚Äôs previous fun job and the stimulus payment. Our investment withdrawal was $33,298 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.59% for the year. Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 2.05% for the year. Our net worth went from $1,333,772 (year zero) to $1,471,164 (year one) to $1,488,092 (year two) to $2,010,995 (year three, as of June 1, technically up another $40k since then). The large jump this year was primarily due to the de facto reverse mortgage purchase on my parents‚Äô home/farm, as well as an approximate 10% increase in VTSAX over the past 12 months.

**Purchase**: I purchased my parents‚Äô home/farm for $460k and gave them a guarantee of free rent for life. At the time of purchase, it was worth an estimated $750k (now estimated at $835k ‚Äì Zillow has our zip code increasing 30% in value in 2019 alone ‚Äì crazy out here). The difference in FMV for taxation purposes is covered by the equal exchange of rent for interest (complicated, not getting into it). So why did they sell? Basically they just wanted extra cash, a guarantee of housing for life, removing the house from their name in case they ever needed means-tested assistance, and to be able to pre-gift an inheritance to their children while still alive. $250k went to them; I bought my sister out for $210k; the difference in true value and sale price was my gift; everyone is happy.

**Reflections**: I‚Äôm not particularly interested in spinning comedy this time, but it‚Äôs been a crazy year for a whole lot of reasons. Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out and have gotten 70-75% of the losses back. I also had to liquidate a lot of post-tax stocks in order to buy my parents‚Äô place before the crash, so that was fortunate timing. I was re-interviewed by the NYT in a follow-up for their piece on FI. I seem to recall being the only subject who had made reasonable gains. I therefore was only a minor footnote in the piece.

**Experiences**: I ran over 3000 miles, won a few more races, and saw my competitive running career come to a close (personal records set in each distance this year: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). I‚Äôm proudest of having set the fastest time ever for a 40+ year old in my hometown HM race. I continued to write in my daily journal every single day since retirement without exception (focusing on weird dreams), went back to teaching as a volunteer ESL teacher for a semester before COVID-19 (teaching intermediate level classes in English), volunteered as a three hour marathon pacer for a few charity races, squandered 300 hours playing video games (Persona 4, Persona 3, FF7 Remake, Witcher 3, Horizon: Zero Dawn), collected some more vintage sports cards (pictures of men with moustaches), spent more time with friends, participated in a financial pharmacist podcast (early retirement, if I recall the topic correctly), visited Alaska/Washington/Victoria for two weeks with my wife, revisited Japan by myself for two weeks (averaged 40k steps per day), got back into some television (Hoarders, After Life, Space Ghost: Coast to Coast, COPS, Star Trek: Picard), spent way too much time on social media trying to correct misinformation on COVID-19, and took up cycling on a pretty serious basis two months ago (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete).

**Upcoming**: What lies ahead in year four? I can‚Äôt say for sure. Definitely more cycling. Possibly learn to swim without a snorkel. Triathlon? Campaign volunteering for the rational party. Definitely not returning to monthly updates. I‚Äôm kind of stuck in a rut since I‚Äôve done most everything I wanted to do. A lot of the stuff I didn‚Äôt tackle is what I‚Äôve lost interest in. Oh‚Ä¶also whatever the fuck I want. I‚Äôm supposed to say that. But seriously, I let this pandemic be an excuse for a drop in productivity. That changes now.",211.0,financialindependence
261,FU Money in Practice?,,521.0,l8rauv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l8rauv/fu_money_in_practice/,1612029346.0,"I am a software developer not yet near FIRE, but I am approaching some semblance of FU money, with a bloated savings account and a decent chunk of change invested in various tax advantaged accounts. This month, I earned a good review at work, and decided I could start to coast a bit more and try to focus more on my mental health. However, my boss had a different plan. Suddenly, I have more pressure than ever to deliver multiple projects yesterday, and am at a loss for how to respond.

How do you use your FU money in practice? In my experience, at least 50% of bosses want to push their employees to give their jobs 110%. I always imagined when I got to this point that I would be able to coast with a more comfortable 80%-90% effort, but it seems most bosses put pressure on their employees to be as productive as humanely possible by any means necessary. The pressure has really started to affect me and I have considered quitting, but since quitting would delay my FIRE date, I would prefer to keep my job with a slightly reduced workload. I also have some fairly specialized skills on our team, which has resulted in me being the only person on our team able to deliver certain projects. I thought this would be good leverage too, but I'm not sure my non-technical boss will truly appreciate this fact until I'm gone.

How do you utilize your FU money to make yourself more comfortable at work, without setting yourself up to get additional pressure from your boss or labeled as an underachiever/candidate for the chopping block?",208.0,financialindependence

264,Space in a conservative FIRE portfolio for high risk investments?,,77.0,l786dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l786dq/space_in_a_conservative_fire_portfolio_for_high/,1611866535.0,"I've been following the FIRE mindset fairly conservatively, building my portfolio largely with index funds and, indeed, that has served me very well. In the past few years, I've also branched out into real estate syndicates, but even then I only pull the trigger on the deals that seem like pretty safe bets. As a result, I haven't lost any money on any of them (not even during this pandemic) but I also don't see the huge returns. After all, risk and return tend to be pretty closely tied.

Lately, though, I've been wondering if I should have a portion of my portfolio dedicated to very high risk investments that have the possibility of mega returns. These might be ""win big or lose everything"" style deals. The deal that really triggered this thought process was one where I _could_ make a staggering return but could just as easily wipe out my principal. I would normally not even give such a ""lottery style"" investment a second glance... but should I?

These Wall Street Bets fights with the hedge funds is another example. The idea of investing in a meme stock would normally be ludicrous to me, but I'm no longer so certain it should be.

For the record, I have already surpassed my original FIRE target of $1.5M (just passed $2.1M last month) if that matters.

What about you? Do you have a portion of your portfolio allocated to hail mary bets? If so, what's your rationale behind how much?",81.0,financialindependence
