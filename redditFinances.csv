2,FU Money in Practice?,,420,l8rauv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l8rauv/fu_money_in_practice/,1612029346.0,"I am a software developer not yet near FIRE, but I am approaching some semblance of FU money, with a bloated savings account and a decent chunk of change invested in various tax advantaged accounts. This month, I earned a good review at work, and decided I could start to coast a bit more and try to focus more on my mental health. However, my boss had a different plan. Suddenly, I have more pressure than ever to deliver multiple projects yesterday, and am at a loss for how to respond.

How do you use your FU money in practice? In my experience, at least 50% of bosses want to push their employees to give their jobs 110%. I always imagined when I got to this point that I would be able to coast with a more comfortable 80%-90% effort, but it seems most bosses put pressure on their employees to be as productive as humanely possible by any means necessary. The pressure has really started to affect me and I have considered quitting, but since quitting would delay my FIRE date, I would prefer to keep my job with a slightly reduced workload. I also have some fairly specialized skills on our team, which has resulted in me being the only person on our team able to deliver certain projects. I thought this would be good leverage too, but I'm not sure my non-technical boss will truly appreciate this fact until I'm gone.

How do you utilize your FU money to make yourself more comfortable at work, without setting yourself up to get additional pressure from your boss or labeled as an underachiever/candidate for the chopping block?",178,financialindependence

5,"Remember all those scary post about ""Passive Investing taking over the market and killing all growth opportunity""?",,1579,l6oxzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l6oxzo/remember_all_those_scary_post_about_passive/,1611811431.0,"# [The Big Short’s Michael Burry Explains Why Index Funds Are Like Subprime CDOs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos)

Every so often someone would post here some article or column about how the fact that ""everyone is moving into index investing and how that would kill the market"", as there would be no untapped value stocks and no opportunity for growth .  There would be long discussions why this was or was not the case that would drag for days. Do you guys remember that?

6,Space in a conservative FIRE portfolio for high risk investments?,,74,l786dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l786dq/space_in_a_conservative_fire_portfolio_for_high/,1611866535.0,"I've been following the FIRE mindset fairly conservatively, building my portfolio largely with index funds and, indeed, that has served me very well. In the past few years, I've also branched out into real estate syndicates, but even then I only pull the trigger on the deals that seem like pretty safe bets. As a result, I haven't lost any money on any of them (not even during this pandemic) but I also don't see the huge returns. After all, risk and return tend to be pretty closely tied.

Lately, though, I've been wondering if I should have a portion of my portfolio dedicated to very high risk investments that have the possibility of mega returns. These might be ""win big or lose everything"" style deals. The deal that really triggered this thought process was one where I _could_ make a staggering return but could just as easily wipe out my principal. I would normally not even give such a ""lottery style"" investment a second glance... but should I?

These Wall Street Bets fights with the hedge funds is another example. The idea of investing in a meme stock would normally be ludicrous to me, but I'm no longer so certain it should be.

For the record, I have already surpassed my original FIRE target of $1.5M (just passed $2.1M last month) if that matters.

What about you? Do you have a portion of your portfolio allocated to hail mary bets? If so, what's your rationale behind how much?",80,financialindependence

Retired last week thanks to FIRE,,3513,l4whet,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l4whet/today_is_the_3rd_day_of_the_rest_of_my_life/,1611605858.0,"I retired on Friday! Didn't get to posting until today because I was too busy doing whatever the fuck I want.

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!",861,financialindependence

12,FIRE & Health-insurance across state lines,,9,l5g4kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l5g4kt/fire_healthinsurance_across_state_lines/,1611674563.0,"Similar to this thread, but more specific [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how\_does\_fire\_work\_w\_end\_of\_life\_and\_health/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how_does_fire_work_w_end_of_life_and_health/)

I have a great set of doctors (primary & specialists) in a city that is known for great healthcare & medical research.

Even though I've moved for work long ago, I've kept those doctors, and my workplace EPO & PPO plans cover them as all big insurances (Blue Cross, Aetna, UNH, Cigna) have nationwide networks.

However, ACA plans don't have nationwide access.

Are you maintaining primary residence in the States where their doctors are, for the sake of getting ACA coverage there?

Or are you  buying insurance in private market from one of the big companies and forgoing ACA? Which would also mean no-subsidy if you'd otherwise qualify",22,financialindependence
13,How does FIRE work w End of Life and Health Expenses?,,40,l55nmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how_does_fire_work_w_end_of_life_and_health/,1611633536.0,"tl/dr: how can you fire at anything less than 60k/yr w health care costs being what they are?

Since healthcare is, typically, an ever-increasing cost in USA, the older you get, how is this calculated into  typical I need $XXK/year FIRE formula? 

Before Medicare even kicks in, if you're now FIRED and no longer on an employer's insurance plan I'm guessing you're now buying an individual plan?

Let's say your annual premium as a 50 y.o. is 6K/year with a $6K deductible; before anything gets covered by health insurance. (And, God forbid, you get diagnosed with a serious illness in October then, of course, your deductible gets set right back to $0 in January.)

And if you get dementia, etc., when you're older than 50, say when your 75, Medicare will not pay for long-term health care. Long-term health insurance is incredibly expensive *if* a policy will even be written out for you and if it even covers beyond five years. Let's assume $3500/year/long-term health care premium, starting at age 65, for one person only. And say that policy coverage is only good for 5 years, which is typical, afterwards you could easily be spending$3-6K/month on care, out of pocket.

Is my thinking wildly off-base? I don't see how one is financially independent with a potential $6-12K/annual cost of health care and then the added possibility or overlap of long-term health care at, say, a FIRE of <60K/year. 

Help me understand. Are you planning on cashing out of your home and living in a senior community 1bedroom when your >50?",110,financialindependence
14,Interpreting Guyton-Klinger SWR,,34,l534iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l534iv/interpreting_guytonklinger_swr/,1611625160.0,"Hi, FIRE. I've been trying to wrap my head around the Guyton-Klinger rules for withdrawals in retirement. For anyone not familiar, Guyton-Klinger is a method for adjusting your withdrawals in retirement according to the behavior of the market. It seems like a lot of people aim for the 4% rule in retirement but plan to cut back their spending during bear markets. Guyton-Klinger will systematize that strategy and also tell you the maximum you can safely spend every year while delivering a higher probability that your portfolio will outlive you than the 4% rule can deliver. 

Specifically, this passage has been giving me trouble:

 ""The portfolio management rule (PMR) determines the source(s) of each year's withdrawal.

* Following years where an asset class has a positive return that produced a weighting exceeding its target allocation, the excess allocation is sold and the proceeds invested in cash to meet future withdrawal requirements. 
* Portfolio withdrawals are funded in the following order: (1) overweighting in equity asset classes from the prior year-end, (2) overweighting in fixed income from the prior year-end, (3) cash, (4) withdrawals from remaining fixed-income assets, (5) withdrawals from remaining equity assets in order of the prior year's performance. 
* No withdrawals are taken from any equity following a year with a negative return if cash or fixed income assets are sufficient to fund the required withdrawal.""

Some of this seems redundant unless I'm misunderstanding something. Is it just poorly written? My interpretation is this:

* Always sell excess weighting of stocks/bonds if there was also a positive return. Use resulting cash for current and future withdrawals as needed.
* If sales from overweighting of stocks/bonds and cash reserve are insufficient to meet requirement for current withdrawal, sell bonds first and then stocks in order of best to worst-performing until requirement for withdrawal is met.

I'm trying to automate Guyton-Klinger in a spreadsheet and I think if I can get the Portfolio Management Rules (PMR) nice and clear I'll be able to finish it shortly. Help me out and I'd be happy to share the finished spreadsheet.

They will end up retiring about ""on time"" by traditional measures (65ish). Thinking of my own, relatively new journey to FIRE, I'm thankful that they are doing well.

It’s helped me achieve financial stability and growth while truly enjoying life (something that can be hard when aiming for a super high savings rate). 

Things I spend on without beating myself up: travel, tattoos, yoga, my partner, my cat, and renting a decent place for myself. These things bring me legitimate joy. 

Things I mercilessly cut spending on: clothes, restaurants/bars, furniture, cars, and new tech/devices. These things don’t really affect my happiness. 

You may have completely different priorities than 
me, and that’s great! My point is just to make it clear what you care about, and allow yourself to direct money that way. Even though I spend on things I love, my monthly spending has taken a nosedive by saving on things I don’t care about.

Much love to you all!

Example: I love travel but that doesn’t mean I book first class tickets and five star hotels. It means I travel cheaply so I can afford more trips throughout the year. It’s all about forming a positive and honest relationship with yourself 🖤",541,financialindependence

24,More money more happiness?,,37,l29p68,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l29p68/more_money_more_happiness/,1611268832.0,"Long time lurker but wanted to share a recent study I came across. Thought it would be interesting to hear the FI crowd’s take on it. 

A recent study by Matt Killingsworth seem to contradict the previous study showing that money matters less for happiness after $75,000. Killingsworth’s study shows increased experienced well-being at higher income levels after studying 33,391 employed participants. 

“The results of the new study, however, reveal that rising income continues to affect the earner’s well-being even into the hundreds of thousands of dollars”

“Killingsworth finds one of the main links between money and increasing happiness is the flexibility a higher income gives people.”

Does this impact your FIRE date? For me, I think focusing on balance and aiming for a slightly higher $ value would help increase my ‘experienced well-being’.

25,How would you handle inflation during retirement? Can 6% inflation decimate your balanced portfolio?,,31,l26wwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l26wwi/how_would_you_handle_inflation_during_retirement/,1611260703.0,"I recently FIRED at 45 with 3.5M, not including my personal residence (1M). My annual spending ranges from about 75 to 80K.  Therefore, my low SWR of 2.3% should last according to the 4 % rule and other popular studies, (e.g. a 3% SWR should never deplete). However higher inflation could still wreak havoc on your nest egg and increases the likelihood of portfolio failure. 

So I'll be using my own numbers to illustrate this example using FireCalc.

For Early Retirees, the typical advice is to maintain a high equity allocation in the portfolio to offset higher inflationary periods. I don't disagree, but this seems to work well for moderate inflation of 3 to 5% but really starts falling apart when inflation reaches 6% and beyond as we have seen in the past. 

&#x200B;

* At 5% inflation FIRECalc found that 3 cycles failed, for a success rate of 96.8% (100% equities)
* At 6% inflation  FIRECalc found that 20 cycles failed, for a success rate of 78.9% (100% equities)
* at 7% inflation FIRECalc found that 35 cycles failed, for a success rate of 63.2%(100% equities)
* at 8% inflation FIRECalc found that 54 cycles failed, for a success rate of 43.2%  (100% equities)

Furthermore, the negative effects are ""magnified"" if **bonds** are used in the portfolio. The success rates would be even lower. For example at 6% inflation with a 60/40 balanced portfolio, the success rate drops to **18.9%.** 6% seems high by today's standards but not impossible! Everyone is assuming inflation will stay low for years but no one really knows when rates will start rising and when they do, anyone holding a balanced portfolio will likely feel its negative effects.

Could someone **knowledgeable** in this matter offer some advice about how to handle high and consistent inflation during retirement? 

My initial thoughts about risk management:

* Reduce spending 
* Stay diversified globally, 
* Holding some Real Estate
* Maintain a high asset allocation to equities and learn to live with market volatility/crashes because inflation is as much of a risk.
* Go back to Work if required
* Win the lottery

Assumptions: 

Using  [https://www.firecalc.com/](https://www.firecalc.com/) to simulate possible scenario's I noticed that higher inflation could eventually decimate a well-diversified portfolio even if invested in 100% equities.

Plugging in numbers in Firecalc yields the following:

**\[Start Here Tab\]** 

* Spending: **$80,000**
* Portfolio: **$3,500,000**
* Years: **55**

**\[Other Income Tab\] -**  **Social Security**

As an alternative, my employer offers a nonqualified deferred comp plan structured as a rabbi trust.

The plan and the match is extremely attractive, and while it is not a 401(k) it allows me to defer up to 75% of my income in a year, payable upon retirement over a 10 year period.

Much of the perspective I’ve read has contributions to these plans over and above 401(k) contributions. That is not my case beyond My wife maxing out her 401(k) and putting the maximum into an HSA. 

Is anyone else in a similar position to me, and how have you approached contributions to these plans and for them Into a FI RE strategy? This is a good problem to have, but a problem  nonetheless.

Anyone who can achieve stable employment can, theoretically, achieve FIRE - but most don't.

I just came across this long article on the subject - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/

The author lists 20 ""flaws, biases, and causes of bad behaviour"". Any resonate with you - it certainly made me pat myself on the back a few times, which makes me suspect there's a few here that I'm just currently blind to in my own life!?

1. Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.

2. Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a reward.

3. Rich man in the car paradox. (You don't admire the man, you think people would admire you if you were the man.)

4. A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult, resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding rewards that come from current decisions.

5. Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

6. Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is the lifeblood of progress.

7. The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.

8. Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear terms.

9. Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian thinking to achieve above-average results.

10. An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean rules but loose and unpredictable trends.

11. The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.

12. A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

13. Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally and physically.

14. A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.

15. An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.

16. Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.

17. A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.

18. Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the inherent complexities of everything involving money.

19. Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.

20. The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your future.

tldr from the author: ""If there’s a common denominator in these, it’s a preference for humility, adaptability, long time horizons, and skepticism of popularity around anything involving money. Which can be summed up as: Be prepared to roll with the punches.""",178,financialindependence

My wife and I rearranged our entire life to hit FI as quickly as possible - Heavy work schedule, plus planning to build NW with BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat).  We are now ~seven years in (out of then-estimated 12 total) and decided to slow down: sold the rental units, paid off the personal mortgage (both financial 'mistakes' I'm very happy with) and am taking a more relaxed, surefire path to FI involving low (but comfortable) expenses, no rentals, and reducing work schedule.  Journey, thoughts, and numbers below.

Journey before destination.

#This is way longer than I intended; it also has all the info in it I enjoy hearing about other people’s FIRE journeys. . . sorry for the length.

###Background (Skip this if you want; I enjoy reading these, so I lay it out for others)

I had terrible money habits growing up: they continued until I was 26.  *Really* bad.  I grew up on foodstamps, and we never had *any* excess money; anything that came in went right back out on expenses.  I’d like to say they were necessities, but looking back. . . I think we could have done a lot better.  The scarcity mindset that living at the financial edge instills is real, and I continued to spend every dollar available to me (by work or by loan) until I stumbled across FIRE.  Constantly racked up credit card debt, and took every dollar that was ever available on student loans.

I regret taking the amount of student loans we did; we could have done less (though not anywhere near zero)  They say “That first 100K is hardest”, but it’s really that “That first 100K from *zero* is hardest” because if you hit a low point of -172,000, compound interest doesn’t really help you for that first 272K. . .

Income/expenses listed are at the end of that calendar year.

* *2011, age 24:*

Graduated in 2011 with a Civil Engineering Degree, wife was a student, working on a Masters in Public Health.  This was the absolute peak of the financial crisis for engineering.  I took a (not quite full time) temp job as a web developer making $20/hr, and we maxed out taking my wife’s student loans:

**Income: 31K me, 0K wife, 31K comb  ||  Exp: ~40K  ||  NW: -$163,000**

* *2012:*

Wife graduated grad school halfway through the year and got a fellowship for $24/hr.  My temp work finished halfway through the year, and I ‘worked’ full-time applying to engineering jobs.  Finally got one after a few hundred resumes, but wouldn’t start until just into the new year, 2013.  Which left that year at:

**Income: 12K me, 26K wife, 38K comb   ||  Expenses: ~40K  ||  NW: -$172,000**

* *2013, age 26: the tipping point year for FIRE*

Note that we *moved significanly backwards* the previous year in net worth due to student loan interest and spending. . .

Started a job as an engineer!  $52k per year ($25/hr).  Straight salary, with a terrible (in retrospect) company.  Worked a *ton* of hours, but only got paid the base salary.  I shudder to think what my hourly rate (working a lot of 70 hour weeks) actually was averaged over this year. . .  Still a financial step up!

**Discovered FIRE.**  I cannot stress enough how big of a change this made for my wife and me.  My wife was naturally a frugal person (I was *not*) but we both had otherwise terrible habits.  Once about my third real check rolled in I googled “Student Loan Repayment” and in the process of trying to find a more robust calculator (I was looking for, essentially, [unbury.us](http://unbury.us), though I didn’t know at that time it existed) and happened to stumble across Mr. Money Mustache in February.

I would like to pause for a minute to point out how terrible of a name this is:  I can credit this one website with legitimately changing my life in a very positive way, but if I ever try to explain what this life-altering blog was, it’s. . . mister money mustache.  Sigh.

I was consumed.  In less than a month I had read everything (and I mean *everything*) on MMM, MadFientist, and JL Collins; I devoured *Your Money or Your Life*, *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and *The Richest Man in Babylon*.  My wife and I planned out our financial goals (Get student loan free, then try to retire in 15 years; will finish well ahead of this) and drastically reduced expenses.  Started aggressively paying down student loans by ‘minimum payment amount’ first to reduce our DTI ratio, hoping to qualify for a mortgage.

I became obsessed with the idea of having a miniature empire of rental units that would help me reach FI faster: small, clean, well-maintained places that I loved and the tenants loved.  Planned to ‘house hack’ by getting a duplex and living in half – the worse shape the better!  I’d always been handy, I was looking forward to sweat equity.  Started looking for a house in May.

Got married in July of this year; I suppose all previous references to ‘wife’ should read fiancé before this. . .

**Bought a duplex:** We were approved for a mortgage due to having some *long* repayment lengths on student loans which kept our DTI ratio on *just* the right side of acceptable, and bought an absolute shithole of a duplex with 3% down in November in a pretty nice neighborhood in Minneapolis.  This was $196K, which seemed *really* high from the lows of 2009; that sounds funny in retrospect now looking back, but everyone was worried it was the midst of a second bubble at the time.  Moved in to one half, and inherited some tenants in the other.  Started rapidly fixing it up with every spare hour I had, as I was still working about 60 hours a week on average.

It was a busy year.

**Income: 52K me, 44K wife, 96K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$140,000**

* *2014:*

Hey, the NW is moving the right direction!!  But now we reach “the boring middle” part of FIRE.  My wife got a full time job with benefits (as opposed to a fellowship) with a pay bump.  I got a 12% raise from my terrible company, mostly in response to threatening to leave due to working conditions.  Working conditions did not improve.  At the end of the year I switched companies (wont’ be reflected in this years salary) to the place I’m still with.  They are a hugely better company to work for, and they pay for *every* hour I work.  The pay was about the same per hour, but since I was working 60hr/week I essentially got a 50% raise.

We began to live on just my wife’s paycheck, and used 100% of mine to pay off student loans/invest.  This hasn’t changed to this day. . . except we now also invest some of hers.

**Income: 58K me, 56K wife, 114K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$97,000**

More of the same, paying off student loans in 2016, continuing the aggressive saving until 2020. . .

* *2016:* **Income: 86K me, 70K wife, 156K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$33,000**

* *2017:* **Income: 101K me, 72K wife, 173K comb   ||  Expenses: ~60K  ||  NW: $45,000**

* *2018:* **Income: 93K me, 74K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $110,000**

* *2019:* **Income: 92K me, 75K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $300,000**

* *2020:* **Income: 110K me, 76K wife, 186K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $700K**

Note that NW has some weird jumps once we got past zero because the duplex went from essentially zero cash flow (lot of costs going in tended to burn all the rental income) to positive cash flow as we started to wrap the years of renovations, to a huge jump upon sale.

 
###2020:  Deciding to Simplify (Start again here, this is the point of the post!)

We had a kid.  

I had already been getting worn out of rental maintenance, especially as we had moved out of the duplex entirely and were renting both halves, now that it was nice.  Working a ton, and feeling like between a (more than) full time job, child, and rental, something had to give.  It was amazingly difficult to find a decent rental manager.

Our personal expenses had slowly shrunk down to be about $4,000/month, $1,500 of which was the mortgage on our new house.  In addition were the duplex costs, and the possibility that I had to have enough cash reserves to cover three furnaces, three water heaters, three stoves; also potential vacancies, other big ticket items (like a $14,000 roof job on the duplex, water damage from ice dams, etc) that were always potentially looming.

The rental income *did* cover these expenses: The duplex was working as a business.  But I was having basically $7,000 a month in expenses despite a fairly frugal lifestyle that had to be covered; **$84,000 a year that *had* to be earned and burned no matter what.**  My wife took a big chunk of time off for maternity, and I wanted to do significantly less, but this ‘burn rate’ was weighing on me.

Our three biggest expenses were the duplex, our house, and taxes.  Taxes are as low as they can be (all tax-advantaged accounts maxed out) and I’m happy to give back to the education and food programs that helped me, growing up.  But, I could sell the duplex, and roll all the profit into the new mortgage, and potentially go from needing to earn and burn $84,000 per year to $30,000. . .
 
###Rent out vs. Sell

I ran the numbers on if I kept the duplex, vs selling and investing it in the stock market.  I looked over the the next 6 years, which is about/past my FIRE date.  My estimated net worth difference would be around $80,000!  Nothing to sneeze at!  However, it also would be the difference between ~$1.3M and ~1.2M, both of which are over my FIRE number of $950K for 3.25% SWR.  If this had been the difference between $0 and $100K, that’d be huge.  That 1st 100K is the hardest.  The 13th 100K, however, is not.

I also had the added wrinkle that if we sold in 2020, it counts as a primary residence, and we don’t pay gains tax on the part we had lived in two of the last five years; this reduced the calculated 80k difference.

**Purposeful “Mistake” number 1: The duplex is gone.**

Was it worth an 8% reduction in net worth in 6 years to me to not have to deal with the rental property with a young child or two?  A thousand times yes.  I will have, I think, significantly less wealth in 30 years because I sold the rental duplex back in July.  But I will have *enough* either way, and I shall never get these years back.

I think buying, renovating, and renting that duplex was the best single financial action I ever took.  I’m happy I ground it out and did the completely hellish task of gutting a 110 year old building in the evenings around a 60hr/week job.  I also don’t think I’ll ever do it again. . .

### Pay off Mortgage vs Invest

What about, now that I’ve sold the duplex, putting it all in the market vs. paying off our home mortgage?  The numbers are pretty simple:  

5% real returns in the stock market (8% returns, 3% inflation, assumed).  Mortgage was, by happenstance, almost the same amount we got out in cash from the duplex, $153K.  We would then not have to pay the $1500/month that was going to principal and interest, and could invest that.  All number – as always – in 2021 dollars for simplicity.

* $153K invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $205k.
* $1,500/month invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $125K.
* A difference of, again, $80,000.  At least I’m consistent. . .

This one was much harder; I really wanted to reduce my ‘burn rate’, but this basically means that selling the duplex **and** using that to immediately pay off my mortgage made us (statistically) $160,000 poorer in about 6 years, another $80k of gains gone.

However, despite me not believing (allegedly) in timing the market, the CAPE is currently quite high. . . and I’m getting awfully close to being able to FIRE anyways, 4-8 years, pending variables.  I also intend to transition my 100% equities to a [100/60/100 V-shaped Bond Glide]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) to maximize safety at the cost of potential gains.  I also believe that [it doesn’t make sense to carry a mortgage into early or regular retirement]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/10/11/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-21-mortgage-in-retirement/).  These aren’t just numbers in a spreadsheet, I actually have to be able to shift the funds to be able to do this, in a way that’s not crippling from a tax perspective.  It’s going to take years to shift to a bond allocation slowly; trying to pay the mortgage off at the same time could very well be impossible.

I don’t have a target FIRE date; I intend to work less and less as I slide into ER, and having the mortgage paid off means that my wife and I can do this whenever we want, without having to do 5 years of financial maneuvering in the background to ‘pull the trigger’.  

The flexibility is worth it.  **Purposeful “Mistake” number 2: The mortgage is gone.**.

We now live very comfortable – I would say luxurious – lives on about $2,500/month.  This will increase sporadically for large trips and childcare, but is our past and current expenses, and will be further in the future too.  I intend to build a fairly large cushion in passive income over this for unforeseen events, then charity, if those don’t materialize, but we don’t feel impoverished in any way at this spending level.

We are privileged enough, lucky enough, and determined enough to now be making about $45/hr each gross, $36/hour each takehome.  This means we need to work a combined 70 hours in a month to be able to cover our expenses; that’s 35 hours each, or  an average about 8 hours *a week* throughout the year.  We are primed to be able to slowly “BaristaFIRE” with reduced hours and benefits in our current jobs, which we both (mostly) enjoy.  

We will both be only when we want – which might be not at all – by age 40.  If you had asked me at 25 if this was possible, I would have laughed in your face.",328,financialindependence

33,Were you happier before discovering FIRE? Ignorance is bliss? Feeling like my obsession with FIRE and money has taken over my life.,,1264,kzma15,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kzma15/were_you_happier_before_discovering_fire/,1610941189.0,"TL;DR - My motivation to FIRE has taken over my life to the point where I'm having a hard time enjoying spending my money or the simple joys and journey of life because I see every decision as either helping or harming my ability to FIRE.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

I discovered FIRE about 2-3 years ago after a friend posted an article to a blog post from Millenial Revolution. Luckily enough, I had made some of the right decisions already (i.e. paid off my student loans, contributed to 401k up to match), but after I discovered FIRE and calculated that I could retire early in 7 years, I started to aggressively save, dumped every spare dollar into index funds, and lowered all my expenses.

I hit $500K in net worth last month and it was a satisfying number to look at, yet as I was scrolling through old photos of myself from 5-7 years ago, I realized I wasn't necessarily happier for it. Over the past 2 years, I realized I've become more annoyed with work, and paralyzed or fearful of making any decisions that jeopardize my ability to FIRE. In the past, I would happily book an expensive, peak-season flight to an international country, buy a new camera just because I wanted it and I would be driven and motivated at work, exhibiting all the behaviors I needed to land that next promotion.

But since discovering FIRE, I haven't taken any international trips, haven't bought anything that's expensive yet could further my hobbies or interests (e.g. new camera for photography, roof rack for car), and outright stopped caring about work to the point where my attitude towards it has become bitter and resentful. I figure if I just coast at my job for the next few years, I'll hit my FIRE goal within 5-7 years. But it is actually out of character for me to care so little about my career and feel so apathetic. My coworkers are pretty surprised and baffled at my apathy towards work.

I'm seeing every single decision I make is either for or against achieving FIRE. Have a baby? But that might push out my FIRE date. Buy a house? It would be a dumb decision in NYC based on all the blog posts I've read. Hold a wedding? How many more years will I need to work? Buy a new laptop? But that's $XXXXX lost if I invested it in the market instead. Get a new job? Why bother, I just need to suck it up for 5 more years. Etc. Etc.

Now I'm wondering if I would've been happier if I didn't discover FIRE at all... If I was ignorant? I see some friends who have no idea what FIRE is happily enjoying their money and their life and I am jealous of them. I feel like it's become a mental restraint I've placed on myself. And these next 5 years feel like they're going to be pretty miserable until I can hit my FIRE #.

Any suggestions on how to break out of this mindset would be appreciated!",497,financialindependence

Checking in for my fourth annual post. I post these as a way to motivate people who don't make crazy incomes. When I started posting, we collectively grossed about 82k in total income with BAs. We've grown and now gross a little north of $107k  W2 income with MAs, as well as $15,300 gross annual rental income. This is in a LCOL city in the Midwest.

The tl;dr of previous posts is that we taught/worked abroad in China for three years, eliminating 55k of student debt and paving the way to pay for grad school in cash. Moved back to the US in 2017, where I work as a social service administrator and SO works as a teacher. Somewhere along the way we picked up real estate investing, but nothing too substantial compared to some people.

**INCOME/W-2 EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY**

\---Me (29 y/o) - Social Service Program Manager - $52,481 +7.5% match

I've been WFH since all of this began, which coupled with my parental leaves means I haven't been in the office for over a year. I’m still having issues with my supervisor, so much so that I nearly quit during one of the flare ups and took a lower pay paraeducator position to escape the relationship. Instead of going that route, I enrolled in a program that will get me certified in the US to teach. I should be certified in summer 2021, I’ve applied for some positions for next year and may choose to pivot away to teaching again at that point. It’s difficult to plan for this though, as my company has incredible benefits and we’re still growing our family. Golden handcuffs. Despite the challenges with my supervisor, I was told during my performance review that I’m a high achiever and continuing to exceed expectations. I tried leveraging that for a 10% pay bump, but HR policies and the COVID context ultimately put a stop to that. All staff in my company were given 2% raises, regardless of performance.

\---Spouse (28 y/o) - Teacher - $54,861

SO continues to love her job, though teaching in the COVID context while mother to a newborn has been emotionally and physically challenging. SO received an 8.53% pay bump from last year due to 1) continuing to plow through additional coursework to move up salary scale, 2) being nominated to join a specialized committee ($500), 3) the salary schedule being renegotiated upward for the fourth year in a row, and 4) being nominated to mentor a new teacher ($1000).

**FAMILY SUMMARY**

We’re both getting itchy feet to go abroad again. While I’m actively applying for positions in my company overseas, we’ve both essentially accepted that it will need to be through teaching. I had a dislike for teaching, but have come to accept that work is something I will likely never ‘enjoy’ and I will likely transition in and out of fields during my working career. Fortunately, the two fields I’ve done are relatively symbiotic and can be leveraged for career advancement. We hope to relocate abroad in the near future, ideally in fall 2022. Updates other than this? We received an unexpected 15k gift that went to brokerage accounts. I picked up guitar October 2019 and have really taken to it, adding significantly to my mental health and resilience during the pandemic. SO has taken up art, adding similar benefits. Kiddo is happy and healthy, and a huge joy to our family. I love being a dad, and the perspective gained from this experience (combined with having financial assets) makes my less than ideal supervisor situation so much more manageable. I just have to remember to take a step back and say, “Does what she’s mad about actually matter in the grand scheme of things?”.

**BUSINESS SUMMARY**

Property #1 - 20% down on $60,000 SFR, $800 base rent with $40 and later $60 pet rent

Last year I reported our realtor thinking we could sell for $75,000 after some slight renovation. We were on the fence with this, but after selling our primary residence at a profit, we were hungry for more while mitigating the risk of the neighborhood the property was in. On closer inspection, our realtor indicated 5k in renovation may catch 80k quickly. We went forward with it, things went overbudget 2.5k, and we ended up listing for 85k. The house sold in 7 hours for 90k. Basing ROI on our 12k downpayment, our overall ROI for this property was 67.47%, while learning a lot about business, landlording, and home repair. Overall, a definite win. We’ll see how this all shakes out with taxes this year, though it should be LTCG and I think we have enough deductions to shield from tax liability.

&#x200B;

Property #2 - 10% down on $270,000 Duplex, \*$2575 rent\*, estimated $2800 rent potential

This is our current primary residence. Class A neighborhood with class A tenants. We pay ourselves $1300 in rent to simulate renter performance. Our tenants started with us at $1200, but after adding a fence (we and the tenants have dogs), this was bumped to $1225 within the first month. We then did a full floor renovation in the fall, bumping rent to $1275. I’d like to find a way to bump rent to $1300, but we have really excellent tenants that take amazing care of the house. Shampooing carpets every 6 months, painting the entire unit (we covered paint costs), adding shelves to the garage, and even sodding the backyard. After the fall renovation, we signed them for a 2 year lease, locking in the great tenants and income for the remainder of the time we envision being in the US.

COVID has been crazy for real estate, with prices skyrocketing in our city. 3 months after purchasing this property, another sold down the street for 30k more than we purchased for. This was lower quality interior, poorly thought out floor plan, and only $1100 rent. Last month I was shopping duplexes and did some walkthroughs. I noticed much lower quality properties in similar zip codes going for 70k more than we purchased for. I asked our realtor to run the numbers and was told we could likely sell for $420-$450k. Which is CRAZY! I’m incredibly tempted to sell now, but I think the family needs some stability. We’ll likely revisit the topic next year when we would qualify for capital gains exclusion after 2 years of residence and be closer to our planned move abroad.

Equity - $31,178.29

Cash - $9,349.17

&#x200B;

Total 2020 contributions - $36,769.45

For 2021, I’m hoping to have more sustained high contributions. From my side of the income, 20%+7.5% match ($1110.19) will be going to retirement, while SO will have about $1375 monthly. I’ve also set up automatic investments of $35/week to go to each of our roths and our brokerage. An interesting observation I noticed with this is that upping our contributions significantly doesn’t have as large of an effect as I would have expected in my FIRE Calc.This is likely because of our already significant contributions, combined with how much has already been contributed already and how growth doesn’t have as much of a chance to take over. For example, we could step off the gas and just do our bare minimums (getting match and required pension) and we still FIRE at 52, as opposed to 42 currently. Whereas if we strain ourselves to what might be uncomfortable, we shift the FIRE date to 40 years old. This is all based on a 5.84% return, so pretty conservative.

Not sure what else to add, [but here are some parts of my spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/Xno3ms4) I like to look at when work has me down.

38,Another immigrant story! From 10/hr in my mid-twenties to coast fire in early 30s,,280,kytsns,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kytsns/another_immigrant_story_from_10hr_in_my/,1610838789.0,"I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while. This sub has really helped me with my relationship to money and to understand the cost/benefit of time vs money. This sub is especially helpful to people like me that come from a different country and no one in their family has retirement accounts or knows how to invest. 

I have been coast fired since late last year when I left my job. I’ll give you a quick summary of my background and then I’ll just talk about coast fire and my finances. 

Summary: Family came to U.S with no money, zero English and was undocumented. Got my citizenship in my early 20s. First and only one in extended family to graduate from college at 25. Once I started making real money, I found this sub and learned how to invest and think about money. I went from making $10/hour in my early 20s to $100k by my 30s. Long hours led to burn out and quit once I was coast fire. Took some time off and now working as freelancer. 

Life in coast fire: I’m working from home so I can run errands during the week. I don’t have an alarm clock, just wake up on my own. I have time to exercise and also take a 40 minute walk on most days. I can take a long lunch if I want to. Once or twice a week I’ll go to the park or a trail nearby.  One thing I hated about working is going to work early and leaving by the time it was dark. I really appreciate the opportunity to spend some time outside basking in the sun during the week. I have more time to meditate and I’ve read a lot more books during this time. 

I volunteer for some organizations and I’m part of some boards. I joined an organization to help me with public speaking & we meet weekly. Even though I haven’t been working full-time like before I’ve managed to keep busy.

I’ve tried different hobbies this past year thanks to the advice of this sub. I tried skiing, baking, drawing, Pilates, oil painting, journaling, a mindfulness course, biking, nail art, and basic coding. There were several hobbies I did not enjoy and won’t do again but I’ll keep up with a couple like journaling and riding my bike. 

Once Covid is under control, I want to spend summers or winters traveling for three months out of the year. And I want to try more social hobbies such as golf and tennis beginner classes, line-dancing, going to more concerts and music festivals, a photography class, book club and some leadership seminars. 

Finances: My net worth consists of my 401k that was rollover to Vanguard, Roth IRA accounts and some brokerage accounts. I don’t have a house and I don’t think I’ll buy one. 

According to mint this is my net worth over time. I don’t have data prior to 2018 because I wasn’t keeping track before.

2018 $100,000 
2019 $200,000 
2020 $250,000 

Budget 
Rent $6,000 
Groceries/ eating out $4,600 
Shopping $2,600 
Auto $1,700 
Travel $1,600 
Personal care $600 
Bills $2,700 
Business expenses $3,500 * this also includes cobra & disability insurance that I paid for the last 3 months of 2020. 

Salary Progression 
Before college $8 to $10/hour | After college $40k/year > $45k > $52k > $62k > $78k $85k > $90k > $100k 

The only debt I have is about $5k in student loans. This means that I only need around $20k to cover my expenses. But I’d like to make more to have more money to travel in style, pay for some classes and just have more room in the budget.

I feel that now I have an idea of what I’d like to do if I do end up retiring early. And this also showed me that I can fill my time and have structure even when I’m not working.",108,financialindependence

43,Mostly ready to retire. I am an old fart compared to most here. FIRE was not a thing when I started working/saving. I am trying to determine what I want to do as I contemplate pulling the trigger.,,236,kxfws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kxfws6/mostly_ready_to_retire_i_am_an_old_fart_compared/,1610661735.0,"I am 57 and have a net worth of approx 1.3M.  800K in self-directed IRA.  200K in non-sheltered investments, about 50K in my new company 401k, 130K in cash (due to a sale of a home).  Home free and clear about 130K in value.

I have been a single income provider working in IT for the last several decades.  The majority of my funds are the result of maxing out my 401K since I entered the workforce.  In that time I have owned several homes.  moved several times and paid cash for my kids (2) college, cars, weddings etc.  


I recently took a job managing development, QA and data services for a company based out of a small town in midwest.  Middle of no-where.

My wife and I absolutely love the small town vibe.   we have always lived in larger metro-plex suburbia.

I have always assumed that I would just keep working until my mid-60s and then; not sure (retire, die, something).  I have never really planned out what happens after.

Living in a small town I have really grown to appreciate the outdoor activities.  Hiking, fishing, (Hunting again after 25+ years).  


I am suddenly very much thinking about just.....   NOT WORKING anymore.    


With really liking small town vibe; owning a house free and clear.  No big expenses (kids/education/etc).  I am just realizing that I can probably do so tomorrow if I wished.  


I am new to this sub-reddit and after reading through a lot of this, I realize that i really could have focused on this as a family goal and probably retired 10 years ago if we had prioritized additional investments.  Rather than just investing through my employer plans.

This is a lot of rambling, please forgive me.  But I want you guys to know that this is VERY doable.  I got here and I wasn't even really focused on this goal.  I just laid out a mostly painless path through 401K investing.

From a retirement perspective my wife and I have gotten very excited about potential travel to equivalent locals globally.  Meaning, look for small towns in Costa Rico, Panama, Portugal, Montenegro, etc and stay for 3 months at a time.  get to know the people and the culture.  I have had the good fortune to travel quite a bit for work and vacations.  But I have NEVER had a break longer than 10 days since 03/21/88 (first day on a ""real"" job)

I am overwhelmed by the amount of support and very helpful and interesting feedback I have received.  My intent was just to encourage others in their progress.  I have gained much more that I gave through this exchange.

How did my second year of RE go amidst COVID-19 and everything else that happened in 2020?  Read on to find out! :-) 

As usual, I've provided the TL/DR up front, but encourage you to read the qualitative details in the body of the post as I think that a story is so much more than just some numbers and bullet points.

For those who aren't familiar with my story, here are links to the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/)  from early 2019 and [1 Year Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f261kn/update_1_year_in_and_loving_it_35_11m_luck/) in early 2020.

TL/DR:

* Net worth increased from $1.40M to $1.61M
* Spent  $30,600 which is under my budget of $33500. This was despite donating an unbudgeted $5400 to charitable organizations
* Cancelled most my of travel plans and adapted to COVID shelter-in-place orders
* Got an article written on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanderousseau/2020/03/05/36-year-old-retiree-5-years-without-paying-housing/) about me
* Invited to a WNYC radio program about finances, but it didn't materialize because of COVID.
* Joined the board of directors and became an officer at one of my queer summer camps
* Didn't meet any of my goals I set out for 2020
* Played A LOT of board and video games online

Next parts I'll break into sub-headings if you want to go to specific parts:

* Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

# Life in a Time of Covid

2020 will almost certainly be remembered and defined by COVID and the changes that came from it. I have a friend who was already ringing alarm bells by mid-January about its possible impact, so I had some time to process and mentally prepare for things once the shelter-in-place orders actually hit in March.

Despite being a fairly low risk to severe impacts of COVID (relatively young and no conditions that pre-dispose myself to severe complications), I chose to take what most would consider to be low risk approach for reasons including, but not limited to, wanting to minimize my potential risk to others and that the long-haul effects of the virus are still very unknown. I have the privilege of not needing to work and put myself at risk and I want to ensure that I'm not contributing to the risk of those who don't have a choice and/or are vulnerable.

*Note: Everyone has their own situation and I'm not attemtping to shame anyone for their personal choices. As someone who is part of the queer community, I think the AIDS crisis is a good, but imperfect, analogy and lesson at how shaming does not work and discussion of harm reduction is the most effective tactic. The limitation of that analogy is that you are effectively only putting yourself and your sexual partners at risk, whereas with COVID, you could really be harming a lot more people who haven't opted in to your risk profile. In short, there are personal decisions that people need to make like seeing their family or having some companionship, but I will in no way condone egregious actions like large unmasked gatherings.*

As an extroverted person who would host regular board game nights, go rock climbing with my climbing partner at the gym, see theater productions, go to board game conventions with thousands of people, and travel to multiple international destinations each year, this year has certainly been difficult. It isn't the year I planned, but I have tried to make the best of it as possible.

How have I adapted to varying shelter in place orders and tried to salvage a pretty bad year?

* Created a couple of Discord servers to maintain contact with various friend groups
* Played board games online using Tabletop Simulator with Discord - I logged over 450 hours on Tabletop Simulator alone!
* Played video Games - Logged 350 hours of Civilization 6 and 175 hours of Hades
* Got a crash pad and been rock climbing outdoor (past two months)
* Movie nights over Zoom/Discord
* Volunteer work online - phonebanking for elections, virtual summer camp activities, virtual workshops.

Basically - Discord and online video/board games have been keeping me sane.

# Major Life Events

Content/Trigger warning - Death and suicide mentioned in the next set of bullet points

* Became a first time uncle but unfortunately couldn't visit my niece. Hoping it will happen sometime by the end of 2021 or early 2022, depending on when I can get a vaccine.
* Had an acquaintance/former coworker take his own life at the beginning of the pandemic (stock market falling, depression, and pandemic stress all contributed).  This particularly impacted me because unlike the next life item, I didn't have the chance to say ""goodbye"". When I officially quit my job and turned my laptop in January, I was going to see him in the office, but I was running late to another commitment. I thought I'd be able to catch up with him some other time, but unfortunately that wasn't meant to be. My fondest memory is when we went to see a World Series game together. It was a bucket list item for me and while no one else was wanting to shell out the cash, he gladly joined me and we had a blast. We got to see Game 2 of the 2010 World Series @ AT&T Park with Matt Cain pitching a gem of a game and a wild 8th inning where the Giants scored two runs via walks and exploded to a blow out victory.
* This summer I had my mom call me and ask for me to hop on a plane to visit becuase my grandma was in the hospital and only had a few more days to live.  I packed up my stuff that night and took the first flight out in the morning. My grandparent passed away (not COVID) about two weeks later and luckily all of our family was able to spend time with her at a family member's home in pallative care and got to say our goodbyes in person.  Note - family visited while masked and socially distanced. She lived a very long life and was able to pass away with family around her, which is about as much as I could ask for given all the other heartbreaking stories I've heard this year of family members not being able to say goodbye.
* I was voluntold (I was happy to help out though) to be the coordinator/project manager and to delegate tasks and facilitate decisions between my grandma's 6 children. THIS WAS STRESSFUL. My grandma didn't even have any assets to squabble over, but decades of emotions and inter-personal conflicts surfaced. Additionally COVID created a complicating situation where, at the time, the church allowed a maximum of 30 people for the service. Problem is that my grandma has 24 direct descendents and counting spouses and step kids that put the number at 35.  This doesn't even include family friends and/or her extended adopted family (she was among one of 6 adopted children). In the end, everything ""worked out"" but not without a ~~bit of~~ LOT OF stress working through the guest list.

# Finances

**Net Worth:** Increased from $1.40M to $1.61M

**Income:** Dividends + Capital Gains: $18,100  (The Capital Gains were via distributions, not sale of investments)

**Spending:** $30,600 out of $33,500 budget. My budget at my current net worth would represent a 2.1% withdrawal rate

The linked image provides my 2020 [Budget, 2020 Actual Spend, and Differences](https://imgur.com/a/MjnLZEq).

You'll note that there are some big differenes in planned versus actual, namely my travel spend was virtually non-existant and I decided that I wanted to donate more to charity this year given that I have more than enough and there were many people and organizations that didn't have enough. Below lists out my notable notable big ticket expenditures for the year.

* Charitable Giving - $5400
* Laptop - $1600
* Rowing Machine - $1050
* Various REI Purchases - $1200

My food budget shrank significantly as I didn't eat out and rarely did take out - it was only $3500 out of a $6000 budget. I still ate well, but did a lot more home-cooking and simpler food - a lot of stuff that my mom would make for me as a kid. I fully expect that my food budget will go up once COVID restrictions lift, but I imagine that they won't go back to pre-COVID spending levels.

For 2021 I will keep my budget the same at $33,500 but will likely come in way under it with my non-charity expenses, but I will probably end up covering the difference by contributing more to charities.

**FIRE Actions:**

* Converted $12,555 from my Rollover IRA into Roth IRA as part of a Roth IRA ladder ($12,400 standard deduction but slight variance at end of day)
* Was vigilant and didn't take any buy/sell action despite the dip in the spring! I briefly lost my two comma status and I got a little bit of anxiety at the trough, but stayed firm with the buy/hold Bogleheads strategy.
* Less of a FIRE action, but more of a reduction in my FIRE risk - CA AB1482  went into effect 1/1/2020 which is effectively a state-wide rent control which limits rent increases to inflation plus 5% per year. I was conservative in my withdrawal rate knowing that a sudden rent hike could happen and I needed to account for it. But now having additional protection via this law, it means I'm EXTRA safe with my withdrawal rate.

**Lean FIRE ""Trial-Run""**

If there was one silver lining 2020 with respect to FIRE, 2020 showed me that a realistic lean FIRE number for me would be around $23,000, which were my expenses this year excluding my charitable contributions and my two big ticket purchases. At my current net worth, this would represent a 1.43% withdrawal rate. I don't plan to spending less money than my FIRE budget of $33,500 - but it shows me that I have a lot of flexibility to adapt IF I absolutely needed to.

# Notable experiences since my last update:

Despite 2020 being a pretty awful year in general, there were a few notable things non-financial experienices/accomplishments that are worth mentioning:

* Became a board member and officer for one of my queer summer camps.
* Participated in virtual queer summer camp and got the ""Golden Unicorn"" (MVP) award!
* Beat Hades and got 49/49 achievements. Highest heat beat is 22.
* Nearly finished our Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 campaign.  Our group of 4 has played S1, S2, and now S0 together and it has been a wonderful shared experience.  I'm glad we could still make playing Pandemic Legacy a reality in a the midst of a IRL Pandemic.
* Visited WDW/US for 10 days total (Pre-Covid) and got to ride Rise of the Resistance... twice. OH MY GOD that ride is AMAZING. It mixes some amazing jaw-dropping visuals, fast paced action, and a tad bit of ""immersive theater"".
* Camped at Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and a few state parks in WA.

# Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

2020 Goals

* ~~Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.~~
* ~~Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).~~
* ~~Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).~~
* ~~Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor. I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.~~

As you can see I didn't meet any of my goals for year 2, but that's COVID for ya.  I would still like to do the first three goals at some point (probably not 2021 at this rate) but realized that I no longer would like to do NOLS/Outward bound. So what are my new goals for the upcoming year? I have to temper it given that I am pretty low on the list to get vaccinated and the world is probably going to still be uncertain. The basis of these goals is based on if they can be done solo and/or with people without specific skillsets (hard to find people with the right skills to pod with and have similar risk profiles) and don't require me to be vaccinated (assuming that for the in-person interaction, it will still be masked/socially distanced).

* Continue to serve on my board and find volunteer opportunities for both queer summer camps, hopefully in person at camp.
* Get involved in local youth outdoor activities such as ICO ([https://www.sierraclub.org/ico](https://www.sierraclub.org/ico)), which has more flexibility than something like NOLS/Outward Bound. I'm also hoping to create/lead a rock climbing program for queer POC youth in my area.
* Do more local outdoor activities (climbing, hiking, biking).
* Camp at a few ""local"" National Parks - Death Valley, King's Canyon, Sequoia
* I have the least control on this last one, but as soon as I'm vaccinated I would love to take an international trip by the end of the year, ideally to Brazil or Laos.

48,"TIL Warren Buffet ""retired early""",,1763,kvzs92,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvzs92/til_warren_buffet_retired_early/,1610482814.0,"I was watching a video on YouTube about Buffett's early years and it mentioned that at the age of 25, he felt he had enough funds to retire and was seriously considering it.

Quote from him:  “The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.” 

In ""retirement"", some people asked him what to do with their money, and he ended up starting a partnership to help manage money... the rest is history!

Just a fun thing I thought I'd share in this forum \^\^

49,Be careful with the predefined FIRE concepts,,969,kvwpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvwpam/be_careful_with_the_predefined_fire_concepts/,1610474045.0,"FIRE is one tool eliminating material scarcity from the list of things you have to worry about, which is great considering the larger goal of building a life you want to live. 
Extreme saving to build up capital equaling 25x your expenses is one way to achieve FIRE. 
Retirement, in the traditional sense of retiring to a life of no particular work responsibilities is one type of retirement. 
BaristaFIREing to a quiet life of easy work is another option. 

All of these things have names. But all of these things are merely arbitrary points on a spectrum of infinite possibilities. Life isn't a forking path, with traditional FIRE going one way, with baristaFIRE pointing in the other direction, and no middle ground between them. You're ""allowed"" to retire to a life based on the 6% rule, with baristafire as a backup. You're allowed to become financially independent and never quit your job if you don't feel like it. You're allowed to retire at 32 fully FI, get bored, start a pottery studio, live off the income from the pottery studio for a while, get bored, close it down, then get a job with the county government cutting down trees. Life is too short to limit your choices to the default options on a forum. 

I think everyone here is aware of this, on some level. But, really  often on this sub, I see people falling into the easy ruts, like treating the 4% rule as an actual rule. Or, they let the easily defined concepts, like coastFIRE, define their goals, when it's pretty clear based on reading their writing that their real goal should be in the Grey Area Of FIRE That Has No Name Yet. Grey Area Fire That Has No Name Yet is perfectly fine.  

Don't let mental frameworks define your path -- let your honest assessment of the life you want to live define your path, and let the rough concepts and frameworks serve their purpose: giving people a starting point for conversations.",241,financialindependence

51,"Have you let diminishing returns lower your savings rate and voluntarily inflated your lifestyle once your nest egg was large enough? What's the ""critical mass"" of your nest egg?",,85,kw8jzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kw8jzr/have_you_let_diminishing_returns_lower_your/,1610510684.0,"I'm playing with some numbers and it's quickly becoming apparent to me that having a high savings rate has diminishing returns once your nest egg is of a certain size.

For example, if you have $300k and are aiming for a cool $1m, you could save $25k per year and reach your goal in about 10.5 years thanks to compound interest.  Alternatively, you could save $50k per year and reach your goal in about 7.5 years.

In essence, having double the savings rate only shaves about 3 years off your timeline.  Of course, that's still a substantial amount of time but I start to ask those classic questions about the tradeoff.  The $25k per year difference is pretty substantial.  That's multiple awesome vacations per year for a decade.  That's housing upgrades.  That's college tuition.  All for just a few years longer.

I realize none of these ideas are new, and that all of this is a tradeoff.  I realize that ""One More Year"" syndrome and CoastFI probably have their roots in this line of thinking, but man—when faced with actual numbers, it seems like a no-brainer to ease up on your savings rate after hitting a certain critical mass.

How have you processed these same thoughts and crunched these same numbers?  Did you find you hit a ""critical mass"" of a nest egg and were able to feel comfortable spending a bit more?  What was that critical mass for you?",86,financialindependence

54,Military Reserves in FIRE,,238,kvhtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvhtz4/military_reserves_in_fire/,1610417102.0,"Hi, I'm wondering if anyone has incorporated the reserves as a barista fire option. I was on active duty for a while and spent a short amount of time in a reserve component and it seems like a great fit for fire so I'd be curious to get other people's takes. Here are my initial thoughts:

* If I join again soon, I'll probably be an O4 (i.e. mid level officer) by my barista fire time period, so I'd maybe make around $15k - $25k / year depending on how much drill there is beyond the standard  2 days/month, 2 weeks/year (I always had to do more when I was in, which was a pain with a full time career, but 3 or 4 day weekends once a month doesn't sound as bad when you're not juggling a professional job).
* Cheap health insurance: \~$50/m for single, \~$200/m for family.
* I don't know how competitive these are but there are full-time positions in the reserves that you can take. In a FIRE emergency situation (either market crash or large unexpected expense), there's a path to a $100K+ job. I truly am not sure how difficult it is to get these full-time positions, but I imagine it's more likely than trying to go back to most professional jobs after 10 or 15 years out of the industry (I know in my field I would never get an interview with a gap that large; plus, you can take these positions for a year rather than trying to get a 100k+ job in the private sector that you want to quit after your investments recover).
* Pension: depending on far up the ranks you go and how long you stay in, it's probably $20k - $30k / yr plus cheap health insurance starting at 60.
* Some structure/progress in life: I know some folks want nothing to do with work--which I totally get--but I think it'd be nice to still have an organization that you can progress through but that doesn't take 60 hours/week of your life.
* There are probably some cool assignments that come up over time, especially as you get to a higher rank.
* Serve my country (This is a big positive for me, although I'm sure it's less meaningful to others). 

Obviously, possibility of deployment is a large con, and if someone is tired of hierarchy,  then the military is the last place you'd want to be.

I burnt out of the reserves while trying to balance a professional job but it sounds like a good barista fire job. What does everyone here think?

Also, one more thing since this came up (and dominated) all the prior threads on this top: joining the military for this is a less attractive option. You need 1 year+ of full time training (with certain exceptions) that will be a decidedly un-fire-like experience so this is geared more towards people who are already in or were in.",87,financialindependence
55,Inside the r/financialindependence Time Machine,,1236,kv2si9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kv2si9/inside_the_rfinancialindependence_time_machine/,1610372290.0,"I started writing this post to try and get my thoughts out, and also guide some of the newer members of the sub. Instead I went back through old posts and just pondered on how the sub had changed since it started.

First lets teleport back to 9 years ago, the world is falling apart due to the Arab spring, but Osama’s dead, the London Olympics is around the corner and the UK and US are looking like they are recovering, curiosity rover landed on mars. Around 1000 subscribers on the financialindependence sub:

The financial crisis is still ringing in the back of your head, you knew people who seemed well off who lost their jobs and houses, the job market has been shit for a while. My parents sold all their shares in 2008/2009 and had three 0% down repayment mortgages for example (it was common knowledge in 2006 that it was a guaranteed way to be rich, reminds me of tesla/bitcoin). However, green shoots have been spreading for a while, 2010 wasn’t too bad really, 2011 is going great. The market is still two thirds below 2008 levels.

You most probably read earlyretirementextreme or thesimpledollar, you most probably had read your money or your life, the millionaire next door or a random walk down wall street. You might have somehow found the bogleheads forum and got linked  through to reddit. I personally couldn’t find any of these resources and was looking at Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, Forex trading, buying houses etc.

So what are the main beliefs and thoughts? The main themes on the subreddit is sustainability, frugalness, being happier with less. I really think that’s a reflection of the time and points in a good way to survivorship bias. The best examples of people who had stayed the course were frugal and lived below their means, they had diversified assets. Index funds werent anywhere near as popular then either so it was much harder to not lose everything in the GFC, but some people were on the index fund train and were comfortable enough to power through. The only real way people could have done that is cut expenses and live within your means.

Heres some example posts. Note all the comments are about living happily with less.

Zoom forward a couple of years to joining at the start of 2015, the world isnt really falling apart yet until next year (BoJo and Trump arent taken seriously), uptown funk hit number 1, Game of Thrones anyone? I think this sub hit 100,000 subscribers around then:

The stock market is on an absolute tear, its finally surpassed its 2008 highs in 2014. The mood everywhere is pretty good, house prices have done very well in cities and recovered in most suburbs. The common person has started feeling ok about stocks again but has no idea what an index fund is, stocks are still considered pretty dangerous if you speak to your uncle. I distinctly remember reading lots of articles (maybe slightly earlier) that Amazon was a bad investment as it didn’t make profit, dividend paying stocks like utilities, oil and tobacco were the game of the day. I personally had made some disastrous plays into renewable energy stocks around 2014/15 as I was trying to be sustainable.

You definitely read mrmoneymustache, probably religiously. You probably post here and read some of the other various blogs in the side bar (frugalwoods, jlcollions, getrichslowly etc.). You may have found the sub through some kooky articles on CNBC or the BBC. The book selections havent really changed much at all.

Main conversation points? Frugality is still the name of the day. Living a happy and sustainable life. Riding bicycles everywhere and doing your own repairs. 4% rule is king. Some dissenting opinions are brewing about how incredulous it is to retire on $600,000, but the conversation is very polite. The veterans' portfolios are really starting to bear fruit and gain notoriety after investing through the downturn (or at least not selling and cutting down expenses).

I really enjoyed reading some of the top posts from this year.

/[u/rootofgoodblog](https://www.reddit.com/user/rootofgoodblog/) ‘s retirement announcement. Some disagreement about whether $32,000 was enough (spoiler, it was, maybe even too much so far) [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired\_at\_33\_with\_32000yr\_retirement\_budget\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired_at_33_with_32000yr_retirement_budget_me/)

Zoom forward to the present day. >800,000k subscribers, the world is falling apart again, WAP was number one for some reason:

10 plus years of constant returns, a flash crash near the start of the year scared the shit out of everyone for all of a month.  You probably know people not working now, but you’ve kept your job and also have saved extra this year. Your mate might even be sitting pretty on 5 bitcoins and some tesla stock. Instead of instilling fear the crash has instilled confidence. Every man and his dog has some ETF ‘Index’ funds. Turns out renewables and Amazon were the right call, go figure. Still, I have more money than the people at work bragging about bitcoin, not that I tell them. If I’d invested in index funds in 2011, not 2014/5, rather than a house, individual shares etc. I’d be richer. If I’d not invested in a second property after that I’d be a lot less stressed at the least.

More than likely you found the site through somebody linking through to the sub, it might have even popped up on your feed. Theres a plethora of blogs and youtube channels, you might listen to choosefi, but just as likely other investing podcasts. The dinosaur blogger portfolios have hit unimaginable heights. Mostly they seem pretty bored of blogging now and rarely post. You probably work in software, you really might just be browsing around and shaking your head at the incredible wealth, you might equally have come and cannot fathom why people think 10% returns are good, you might equally also think 4% of your portfolio sounds risky.

Conversation points now? Money is king. Lots more people that have stayed the course. It’s very common to be told that your portfolio isnt enough, its also pretty common to have to defend some luck you’ve had. A lot of portfolios are bitcoin and meme stocks, but still really the minority on this sub. I personally hide out in leanfire in my safe space.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c2fotn/unpopular\_opinion\_thread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c2fotn/unpopular_opinion_thread/) One of the most popular posts last year. Probably skewed by hitting the front page

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular\_opinion\_1m\_isnt\_a\_lot\_of\_money\_anymore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular_opinion_1m_isnt_a_lot_of_money_anymore/) By my reckoning that was about $870k in 2011. I’d like to think people were arguing about shiller cape ratios, but not really.  The estimates of FIRE have definitely ballooned.

Now what’s my point? My original thinking was to write this for my own benefit. But also just show people it’s important to run their own race and be nice to each other, but to also think in terms of decades rather than thinking in the present. It took 6 years for the stock market to recover in 2008, this time it took 6 months. So much happens, so many plans seem incredulous but work out, some people get lucky, some people don’t. The people that have stayed the course are more than likely frugal, more than likely good at sticking to an achievable plan, and more than likely good at tracking things so they can adjust quickly. However some people stayed rich from the 2000’s housing boom the same way some people will stay rich from bitcoin and the 1990s tech stock boom. This fact is not my problem, I have a plan and I’m sticking to it. I had to message my dad regularly in March not to sell, although thankfully this time he had a competent financial advisor that he actually listened to rather than his son.

Where will you be in 9 years? It’s good to think about that.

57,FIRE Success story in the making - Learn to Earn,,163,kurz7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kurz7v/fire_success_story_in_the_making_learn_to_earn/,1610328097.0,"Hi Everyone, Longtime lurker first time poster here. I just wanted to thank many of you guys for the tips over the years and to give a bit of inspiration and tips to those who earn much less than the normal posters here. 

To give some perspective i'm 31 and 6 years into my FI journey (2 years into FIRE) I got started at 25 (2015) I was making about $300 per week in construction and my wife was out of work. One day I discovered the book The Richest Man in Babylon and was off to the races. Before that I was always a decent saver but had very little income, that book changed my outlook and my life. I started saving 1/10th of gross income and throwing into individual high quality stocks.

We were fortunate to live in a Very LCOL area but had about $5k in credit card debt and being in a small town without many job prospects and only a high school diploma not much hope of anything better but I still saved my $30 per week. 

I also started to follow the advice in the book and work on educating myself, I have always enjoyed technology and decided that would be my road out of the heat and cold of construction work. After looking through educational opportunities I decided to go for an IT degree with WGU since I figured I could accelerate and finish the degree earlier than expected. I did tons of research and was super excited when I sent in my Application to WGU. Unfortunately though I was declined...... From WGU... I felt dejected and stupid. A few days later I was told that my rejection was due to having 0 transferable credits and that If I went to a Community College and earned some I would probably be admitted. Sounds easy enough but I lived in a small town no where near a CC so i gave up on that and kept saving.   

About 7 months after being Rejected a new WGU admissions counselor called me and asked about my plans. He informed me that in place of college credits I could take 1 of the IT certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+)  and get enrolled if I passed one. I went on Amazon that day and spent 2 weeks worth of savings ($60) on a book to take the Network+ as I was very interested in understanding Networking and thought I could work on learning it as a new skill.

I studied and studied day and night (8hrs per day after work) for 4 months, paid the $300 test fee and scheduled the test. Never felt as much pressure on a test before since I knew I couldn't afford a retake. That test was the most difficult test I had ever taken in my entire life. I was so nervous to click the submit button at the end of it that I was sweating. But I passed! A few weeks later I was enrolled in WGU! And a few weeks after that since I had a Net+ cert I got a JOB! in IT! the pay was $13 per hour and a 45 min drive but I knew that was my shot and made it count. I was 26 when all of this happened (1 year into my FI journey). 

Fast forward - I advanced in the IT dept at that first company always volunteering to figure out and fix the hardest issues and seeking challenges while continuing the WGU course material. After a few years I had enough experience working with Data Systems that I moved a few hours away to a Larger Medium COL city and took a contract job making $90,000 per year. From that job I moved up the ladder and began saving more and more especially after discovering this sub-reddit.

 My wife and I were so impoverished in the beginning that we got used to that level of income and although we spend about $40k per year now including rent ($2300 per month), Insurance, utilities and car payments (We bought hail damaged cars 10K off brand new) as well as taking 2 large vacations per year internationally. We don't buy luxury items and still bargain hunt. On top of that my salary has increased to $140k and by living in a larger city my wife was able to get a job making around $30k. We now save 50+% of our income and work from home.  

Last year at 30 (5 years removed from poverty) I earned that Bachelors from WGU in IT. It took a lot longer than I hoped but that was due to my employment situation. I also hit the $100K Net worth mark that would have seemed like Mt. Everest not that long ago.  

I mainly wanted to post this for the ones who are starting off like I did 6 years ago. In small towns, without education or skills it can be a lot harder to find opportunities and its very easy to give up but I'm living proof that escape is possible and all of these 100K+ jobs that seem like dreams are actually very possible with a few years of hard work and determination. I really hope that you guys just keep working towards your goals, Don't let anyone or anything discourage you or disrupt your plans even if it hurts just keep going after it.",23,financialindependence

61,FI people with adult children - how are they doing financially?,,830,ktxls4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ktxls4/fi_people_with_adult_children_how_are_they_doing/,1610220686.0,"I am trying to teach my 13yo about how money works and the importance of saving and investing. She gets money from a few sources, including a weekly allowance, gifts from relatives, and a small amount from working in my business. I require her to save 30% of everything she receives, which goes into her savings account. I show her how the account is growing, and I told her that once it gets to $3,000, she can invest it in the stock market (mutual fund).

Still, I'm not sure that this is making any sense to her. Does anyone have any success or failure stories when it came to teaching your now-grown children about money?

&#x200B;

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your advice, experience, anecdotes, snarky replies and funny stories! After reading every comment, these are the takeaways that will shape my next steps:

&#x200B;

1. Some people (or their kids) ""got it"" (saving and investing) at a young age - like kindergarten. Others got it in their 20s or later. Some said their kids still haven't gotten it. I conclude that, for my daughter, investing for the long term is probably too abstract at her age.
2. A LOT of you gave incentives/were incentivized to save (e.g. like matching savings) and make money (chores or jobs). There were a couple examples of the bucket system and games. One person mentioned charity. Great idea.
3. Many of you taught or learned through example, and said kids are ""always watching"" even if it isn't readily understood at the time. Not just finance stuff.
4. It is better to teach than to not teach. There is a risk of backfiring or it may not have any effect at all, but many wished their parents had guided them when they were young.
5. On a technical note, some questioned the $3k investing threshold. I was still stuck in the Vanguard minimums. When the time comes, we'll look at ETFs.
6. There are a lot of resources for teaching kids about money. Books and YouTube.

Given the above, I've decided that first I'm going to show her how to budget the money she has and will be receiving in the near future (like allowance). Investing was just putting the cart before the horse so to speak. I talked to her about budgeting yesterday, and she showed me a note she keeps on her phone. It lists her current savings and money coming in. So that was good. I'm also going to kill two birds with one stone and show her how to use Google Sheets. Will be good to keep track but also to teach her about spreadsheets in general (not just for finance). She's also focused on saving up for a new phone,  so that can ""anchor"" the lesson. 

Next, I'm going give her some incentives for saving. Not sure exactly what yet, but something like matching 50% of the savings she's accumulated by each birthday (Initially I wanted 100% but my wife laughed and said that by high school we might owe her all of our money lol).

Finally, I need to be a bit more aware of my own habits. There were a couple times when she didn't have any money with her and I had to loan her $5 or so until the end of the day. I'm going to stop doing that for the most part. Also, I owe her some money for gift cards that I bought from her, but I've been letting it float for too long. Kids are watching, right?

Actually just a couple more things about what I ""read into"" many comments. There is a LOT of love (sometimes tough love) passed from parents to their kids through money lessons. Parents have done what they can, but also stressed that kids need the freedom to make their own mistakes. Hearing all these stories was very encouraging. Kudos to the FI community!

Too many people in this sub use % of Income, yet that isn't useful when for some people with very high salaries decreasing their spending means cutting back on only the most superfluous luxuries (fancy cars, boats, McMansions, etc.) while for others with more modest salaries it means cutting back on more typical luxuries such as eating out, vacations, spacious housing, etc. 

I think the living wage calculation is particularly good as it breaks down basic spending across all of the most significant spending categories, as well as taking into consideration the cost of living in any particular metro area/county, the number of dependents, and the number of income earning adults in the household. 

The fundamental idea behind living wage is that it is the amount of money necessary for someone to live a minimally comfortable life. Now I'm not saying that everyone should be aiming to be at or below this number, the documentation of the calculator even states that the values it provides are simply a ""step-up"" from poverty, but I think that these values would provide a good relative target, for example within 150%, to help people aim towards with their spending.",263,financialindependence

My fathers expenses have more than doubled since my mother died. He has a degenerative disease and has to pay for people to come to his house to help with things like making food and getting dressed. My FIRE budget certainly would not cover these kinds of expenses. In our area, its impossible to find reliable home aids who would be covered under Medicaid after he runs out of money (which will happen this year). So his only other option would be a nursing home. Until he is vaccinated, that is not an option. My family lives in a small home and we have lived a frugal lifestyle. I have no where to put him in my own home and he wouldn’t want to move here anyway. My expenses have also increased as I travel often to see my father and help in any way I can. For those who already live a conservative lifestyle, don’t fall into the trap of planning a retirement budget of 80-100% of your pre-retirement expenses. I am adjusting my approach and setting 150% as my new target. This is causing me to have to completely rewrite my plans. Most elderly people are not going for a walk in the park one day and dead the next. The process can be ugly, time consuming, and expensive. That mini-retirement I was planning may be spent as a caregiver for a parent. If you successfully apply the FIRE principles, people will know it and will come to you for help.

74,Long Term Care Insurance and FIRE,,80,kr2tfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kr2tfm/long_term_care_insurance_and_fire/,1609867032.0,"After reading this post by [u/WebsterDad](https://www.reddit.com/user/WebsterDad/), where many people suggested that Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI) should be part of a FIRE plan for those of us in the US, I decided to start a separate thread about it.  I am going to condense some of the important points about LTCI from that thread into this one.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the\_real\_costs\_of\_aging\_and\_impact\_on\_adult/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the_real_costs_of_aging_and_impact_on_adult/)

LONG TERM CARE AND GENERATIONAL POVERY

I had not realized how the cost of long term care for parents can wreck someone's plan to use FIRE to escape the cycle of generational poverty.  If your parents were low income or did not save for their own retirement, and you are trying to break that cycle of poverty by pursuing FIRE, your plans may be jeopardized because you need to use your nest egg to pay for your parents' care.  Similarly, if you need to pay for your own longterm care out of your own nest egg, you won't have as much money to pass down to your own children.

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

In the US, people over ~~62~~ 65 are eligible for Medicare, which helps with medical bills, but people are not eligible for Medicaid, which helps with long term care, until they have used up all their resources, including their equity in their home, and are effectively destitute.  Even then, the long term care provided by Medicaid is in short supply, is determined by the laws of individual states, and anecdotally is much worse than private care.  Lastly, any assets given to children with in the previous five (soon to be seven) years of applying for medicaid still count in the calculation, and will likely prevent parents from being eligible.

So, is LTCI the solution?  Should LTCI be part of our FIRE plans?

PRICE OF LONG TERM CARE

Here are national averages according to genworth.com.

     In-home care 5000/month
     Assisted Living 4500/month
     Nursing Home 8000/month

Care cost is location dependent.  You can find averages for your state here [https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html](https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html)

COST OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

Long term care insurance usually has a benefit cap of about 160K, with a defined daily or monthly benefit (for example, $180 or $5000 respectively).  That means that ""Long term care"" only last around three years before the benefit is exhausted.

Insurance cost is location and age dependent, but here is a guide

     Average annual premium
    
     AGE 55
     Single Male	$1,876
     Single Female	$3,141
    
     AGE 65
     Single Male	$3,081
     Single Female	$5,085

From [https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749](https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749).  Note that female cost is higher because they live longer and are therefore may be more likely to need long term care.

SO IS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOUR FIRE PLANS?

You really only need insurance for things you can't pay for yourself.  So, is LTCI worthwhile?

Let's look at a very simplistic example.  Assume I start my policy at age 55, and pay until age 70, then fall ill and die after three years of care.

I would have paid about 34K over 15 years (1876 x 10 years + 3081 x 5) for the insurance.  So I (or my estate) would come out 144k ahead (minus the opportunity cost of not having that money invested).

I have three kids that stand to inherit my estate, so part of my FIRE plan is capital preservation for them, so LTCI seems like a good bet for me.

I keep thinking one day I'll get out of the 9-5 world but have a hard time figuring out how and when to do it.   I always say ""just another year or so, the money is too good to turn down"" but I'll be 40 in March (not old I know).   While 40 isn't old, I don't want to keep running on autopilot until 50, or 60, and miss my opportunity to work less while young enough to enjoy it. 

Anyone else dealt with this scenario before?   What did you do? 

FYI I don't have enough 401k to retire and live on it yet, but calculations show I probably have enough to leave it be and then would have enough by the time I'm 65.   This the question about coast fire. 

Thanks.

Edit - thanks for all the replies.  What I'm thinking is maybe go for ""just another year or two"" full time if I can swing it, pad the accounts a bit more, which I probably can do since I'm not miserable and I'm in (seemingly) quite good health, and then at that point try to negotiate down to 3 or 4 days a week at the current place of employment and run that way for a while and see how it feels.  

That way I can keep doing something I know well and still be making enough money to tuck away a few dollars every month yet not live like a college student.   If I were to get say 60% of my paycheck now, I'd be fine since we are in a lcol area and don't have a mortgage or really any other payments besides utilities.   

My wife has great Healthcare (as do I) so we'd probably jump onto her plan if I went part time.  But at some point health care will be the kicker.  If she wants to go down to part time we will somehow need $1000/mo or more for health insurance.  Maybe we will have a public option by then.  I hope.  If not I guess one of us works full time until we are 67.  Fun.",117,financialindependence

77,A valuation approach to the safe withdrawal rate,,894,kqbuzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqbuzl/a_valuation_approach_to_the_safe_withdrawal_rate/,1609777077.0,"So I put together a white paper of sorts for a study I did on safe withdrawal rates and how they're affected by market valuations. I had previously taken a more qualitative look at it ([HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ajp2y4/market_valuation_and_its_effects_on_the_safe)),  but I wanted to expand on the idea and actually see if it were possible to formulate a SWR forecast. Links to the paper are listed below. 

[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yO0K96Iyc09ihjk8f6j-yZizVGVJDCvw/view?usp=sharing)

[Excel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n8suK1EdGLvpuXJ_JtKRx9cF4rO0VrO/view?usp=sharing)

In the paper, I shared my methodology as well as proposed a variable withdrawal strategy based on this new valuation approach. 

I think it's worth the read (and it's not very long with lots of pictures), but I'll share some of the findings below. 



**Quick Intro**

I calculated the actual SWR for every year from 1928 to 1990. I compiled these SWR's along with the CAPE (Shiller PE) and 10 year treasury yield for each starting period, and performed a linear regression analysis on the data. The resulting equation showed good correlation (R^2 = 0.72). Refer to the paper for more details on the methodology. 

All data in the study is for a 70/30 portfolio.



**Findings**

The 95% confidence formula for SWR based on this valuation approach is as follows:

SWR_predicted = 0.55597 × (Implied Yield) + 0.11051 × (Spread) + 0.0082319

where, 

Implied Yield = 0.7 × (1/CAPE) + 0.3 × (Treasury Yield)

Spread = 1/CAPE - (Treasury Yield)



**Variable Withdrawal Method**

In the paper, I looked at one way to implement this valuation approach and compared it to the trinity study. The basis was simply withdraw the amount based on the predicted SWR and portfolio value at the start of each year. I set a withdrawal floor at the minimum of 40k or the 1st years withdrawal amount. Setting a floor is important from a practical sense as any methodology that could leave you withdrawing at the poverty level isn't very useful. 

Performing a back test, this method never failed in any 30 year period, and also reduces the likelihood of massive portfolio expansion like trinity study has in the past (1980's for example). Withdrawals taken from year to year are also relatively smooth with the variable approach. 

In the paper, I shared portfolio performance and withdrawal summaries for some interesting years: 1929, 1966, 1982, 2000.



**Current State of Affairs**

To kick off 2021, the current projected SWR is projected to be between 2.35% - 4.81% (likely a little higher after this morning). The lower bound of 2.35% ties the year 2000 as the lowest predicted SWR of all years in this study.

80,"Adapting to changing conditions- Consider Investing in dividend paying stocks as ""bubble/volatility proofing"" when FIRE",,0,kr3tkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kr3tkm/adapting_to_changing_conditions_consider/,1609869797.0,"So the common idea on here is to just go into a broad stock market ETF like VTI and just withdraw a fixed amount each year. Basically, 4% is the magical safe withdrawal rate, so once you hit $1 million, you can withdraw $40,000+ inflation for life. Most of this belief is based on historical data.

We then saw a post earlier this week that showed that a 4% withdrawal rate since 2000 from the S&P500 meant that your current NW would be just 23% of the starting amount. This would certainly cause anxiety especially with the market volatility https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kpodhb/charts_2020_a_good_year_for_people_who_retired_in/

Some people might argue ""you cherry picked the worst year"", but mathematically, you're most likely to hit your retirement goals when the market boomed to an all time high than after a crash.

When the tech bubble crashed, the S&P500 dropped by nearly 50%. If you were invested in tech ""growth"" stocks, you would've been hit way harder. The Nasdaq fell by 77%!

When relying on selling shares to fund retirement, you're vulnerable to whatever price the market dictates. So if unjustified panic results in prices too low, you still have to sell at that price.

So if you lose 50% of share value, your 4% withdrawal rate becomes 8% of your portfolio.

In the past, bonds were the means of hedging against said volatility risks. But back in 2000 bonds were yielding 6% and were actually a great alternative. Now treasuries yield 1% which won't even beat inflation.

I would argue that in the age of low interest rates, dividends should play an important role in protection against excess valuations for retirees.

Dividends historically have been less volatile than share prices. For example while the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 50% in 2000, dividend payments hardly budged https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend/table/by-year The same is true in 2009, when the stock market dropped by 60-70%, but dividends only dropped 20%.

As was seen in 2000, Some of the companies most at risk of bubble territory are companies that aren't paying dividends. Companies that don't return capital to shareholders, but are priced highly based on expectations of future growth. 

Most of the stock market price growth for this year has been from non-dividend payers like Tesla and Amazon. Tesla is currently trading at 34 times their annual revenue, and 1459 times their earnings. So much growth is priced in that the slightest slowdown in growth will decimate their price.


As a young investor trying to grow wealth to reach fire, investing in growth opportunities can be a good long term play. Even if you buy into a bubble you have time to recover if you hold. Lower prices are an opportunity to buy more for less. But as someone depending on their stock portfolio for income, a change in prices affects you dramatically.

Historically, the dividend yield on the S&P500 was high enough to fund retirement on it's own. Before 1985 the yield was almost always above 3%, and often averaged above 4%.

However the dividend yield on the index as a whole has hit record lows this year, as valuations of growth companies surge, and companies look to buybacks and acquisitions rather than dividends to utilize excess capital.

With the S&P500 dividend yield being at all time lows(1.5%), overall market dividends don't provide the level protection they have historically. With treasury yields at <1%, they are vulnerable to inflation/interest rate hikes, have little upside, and produce little to no income.

Investing in a dividend paying index to provide a baseline level of income can help reduce the need to sell during a downturn while still providing upside.",102,financialindependence

* [Graph 1](https://imgur.com/a/qZFlNuK): Graph of percent of portfolio remaining over time for people who retired in 1/1/2000, comparing different withdrawal rates. Focused on people allocated 100% S&P500, with one line of 10-yr treasuries for comparison

&#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow!

82,4% Withdrawal vs Distributing ETF,,10,kq49q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kq49q0/4_withdrawal_vs_distributing_etf/,1609747279.0,"Once the retirement moment comes, the 4% withdrawal rule (or a more conservative 3.25%) should be used to provide a regular stream of cash to cover the living expenses expenses. I see a potential problem with this: in a typical FIRE portfolio the stock portion is large, and even larger now that bonds do not provide any return. Hence, in case of market swings, the total value of the retirement portfolio could get a negative drop (e.g. last March with the Covid crash).

QUESTION: in a retirement phase, shall the FIRE portfolio move to a more conservative mix and how to do so?

As alternative, what about migrating the growth portfolio used to reach the retirement new worth to a retirement portfolio based on distributing ETF? 

Just to give some examples on these latter products that I found (the dividend value is just an indication, not in real time with markets):

\- GLDV >> dividend \~4%

\- IAPD >> divident \~4%

\-STHE >> divident \~5%

\- EMLOC >> dividend \~5%

The above distributing ETF should provide a more stable conservation of the retirement capital, compared to a growth portfolio too pushed towards the stocks market in order to get.

I might be wrong, hence happy to discuss here - especially with people already in the RE phase.",44,financialindependence

We built a retirement portfolio in rental property. The cash flow basically covers living expenses and inflation adjusts. In 15ish years cash flow will boom again when mortgages start to go away.

She left her corporate job 2 years ago and is a realtor now. It was supposed to be pre-tirement  but even working part time she is making 3x our annual expenses. The taxes are brutal.  We set up a sepp and she is pretty close to maxing that out annually. 
Add into this the fact that I flip houses occasionally and those hit as ordinary income. 

So if I leave my w-2 and business continues to be good do people typically continue to ‘save for retirement’ when retired?  Is there a point when income is already on track to be way more than enough by classic retirement age?

84,In defense of OMY Syndrome,,52,kppkkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kppkkq/in_defense_of_omy_syndrome/,1609697726.0,"After another instance of looking in the mirror and asking myself where the heck another year went, the idea that we are always ‘in the present’ - and its relation to FIRE - occurred to me.

If we assume that, whenever we retire, the only thing that matters is how we feel in the present, we can make a stronger case for making that moment as comfortable as possible.  I would definitely rather fly first class and have six vacations a year, as opposed to coach / two.  I would rather eat extravagantly than not.

Giving your money one more chance to rise by 50%, say another 4-5 years, would likely drastically change your comfort level for all your future “present”s.

It’s a similar concept as going through all the work to graduate college.  I have little memory these days of the pain of sleepless nights writing papers, but I’m sure glad, now, I put in the time to do it.  I don’t remember the struggle, but my present self reaps the gains every day. 

I feel this is different than the standard reasoning behind OMY, which is generally tied to wanting a bit of a cushion or concerns about current market conditions (ie, sequence of returns risk).

We can never predict how long we have on this earth, so I fully recognize the above can jeopardize some of that precious time.  But I do feel strongly that the past is always just a memory, and my present self is almost always happy with prior sacrifices I’ve made.

**TL;DR**: grew up in poverty (financially only, plenty of love and plenty to be happy for), worked hard, valued education, and now I'm getting by. Components of my dashboard are **-linked-** within the post. Enjoy and critique!

**Background**

I'm 27, male, single, grew up in poverty in the rural Midwest. I'm first generation college along with my 2 siblings, state school educated, and tend to think I live below my means. I've been introduced as ""the cheapest a-hole you'll ever meet."" While I am frugal, I always pay more than my fair share, feed guests and provide alcohol, volunteer my time, and tip generously when services are provided (haircuts, meals out, ice cream).

I won't apologize for any privilege. My parents are hard working, loving people who dedicate their lives to our family. There was no family college or direct financial assistance. One of my earliest memories was asking my father if we were rich. His response, ""we are rich in love."" Growing up, we were 5 people living the American Dream, as far as I'm concerned.

I'm employed as an System Admin within the Federal Government. I'm IT by trade only; I majored in a physical science (BS & MS), and gravitated toward statistics and computer science within my field. My earnings/location by year:

* 2015-2016, WI, $15,000 (graduate school)
* 2017, DC, $45,000
* 2018, DC, $56,000
* 2019, DC, $69,000
* 2020, DC -> IN, $86,000
* 2021, IN, $93,000

I've been tracking money in and money out since starting grad school in Sept 2015. I'm talking every receipt, categorized (split & figure tax/item if, say, making a Walmart run purchasing variety of goods) and entered into excel. My approach will certainly seem excessive to some, but it takes me < 1 min to enter the data usually, and I find it fun and worthwhile. Different strokes for different folks.  I've collectively spent MANY untracked hours tracking my economy and developing this tool. It's an ever-changing tool that was originally based off of this [rudimentary budget](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-budget-spreadsheet.html), and grew in inspiration of many of the financial tools I've come across in this sub.  I have linked to graph inspirations for those looking to replicate.

**-**[**Assets**](https://imgur.com/5Rb535S)**-**

My spreadsheet is driven by this Data-Assets timeline. In this snapshot, the timeline spans my period of record, Sept 2015 - Dec 2020. The blocks on the left are fairly self-explanatory. ""Returns"" are shown over the course of the timeline and for the last month (Dec 2020 in this case). ""Balance"" is the Asset balance for the last month of the timeline, and the Net/In/Out is the money in/out during that month. I count investments as money out, so the 'net' is money that didn't have a destination (didn't pay bills/groceries/get invested/etc). ""Savings Rate' donuts are for the last month of the timeline (dark green, 77% for Dec) and the year of the month (light green, 27% for 2020). This savings rate is: ((Take home pay - non savings spending) / take home pay). ""Financial Independence"" was an effort to track FI, though there is a lot of variability. ""Inflation Rate"" is non-savings/non-tax spending compared to the year before. This helps keep my lifestyle inflation in check. I moved cross-country and purchased a vehicle in cash in 2020, which contributed to the 2020 personal inflation.

Here is what the graph on the right represents:

* Purple: Health Savings Account. The dark purple is the amount of HSA invested; the light purple is held by the bank, earning 0.02%. The purple line is total $ in HSA
* Green: liquid assets. The bars represent Savings/Checking/Money Market, CDs, and Series EE Bonds, which were gifts from grandparents in the 90s/00s. The green line is total $ in fairly-easy-to-liquefy vehicles. I am risk averse and hold too much here, though home ownership is hopefully < 5 years away.
* Blue: Investments. The dark blue is retirement (Roth IRA and Thrift Savings Plan-a 401k). The light blue is my taxable brokerage. The blue line is total $ invested
* Black: total assets. I do not include vehicles or belongings in this. I rent, so no equity either.

The IRA/TSP/HSA donuts are used to see where I am in terms of contributions vs limits. Don't worry, the surplus $233 in IRA and $250 in HSA are 2020 contributions to the 2019 IRA/HSA.

**-**[**Expenses**](https://imgur.com/c6zdkL2)**-**

​""Past 12 months"" are sparkline columns representing the relative proportion of the category over the past 12 months (right-most column is darker and is the last month of the timeline, Dec 2020 here). The categories are: taxes, housing, savings, transportation, food, utilities, medical, personal (clothing/toiletries/etc), alcohol, and entertainment. The actual vs expected graph (based on [this](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/5838-excel-actual-vs-budget-chart.html)) shows what percent I spent on a category relative to my Net (after tax) Income (except I use Gross for savings and taxes). This doesn't add to 100 since I use a different basis for comparing 2 categories. This Savings rate calculation is *dedicated*\-savings only, which differs from the one in the 'Assets' section. I need to revisit, pick one way to calculate, and run with that.

A note on transportation. Prior to tracking, I owned a 1990 98 Oldsmobile regency and then a 1986 Ford Ranger. These vehicles cost $500 and $550 cash, and I paid that and insurance. And they broke down a lot and I spent a lot on repairs (though my dad and I did many of them at home). I lived car-free from 2015-mid2020. I bought a used Japanese car in Sept 2020 in cash when I moved to Indiana. I hope to keep it for many years.

The graph on the right is one of my favorites. I use GETPIVOTDATA to populate the table and create a heat-map of the selected category/sub-category. I can select as many subcategories to compare as I want. The graph is annual cumulative expenses based off the dynamic table. The gray lines are previous years, the bold black line is the average of the previous years, and the red line is the current year. The text (2020: $XXX, Average: $XXX) shows the current month vs average spending to date. This graph has really opened my eyes to the evolution of my spending habits. As a proud Wisconsinite, I've selected my alcohol-related expenses to compare in this image. ""Alcohol"" is liquor store purchases, and ""bars"" is money spent at bars.  In 2016, I was studying a lot and mostly pre-gaming and riding the buzz. Also, it was cheap to get drunk in Wisconsin (25 cent beer nights).  I spent a lot of time in DC bars being a reckless 20-something. I only drink socially, so consumption is down in 2020 thanks to COVID.

**-**[**Loans**](https://imgur.com/H3Sih7t)**-**

The home and vehicle loans are placeholders for whenever I might get those types of loans. My student loans were subsidized. I qualified for academic, community, and need-based scholarships and grants. They paid for my tuition and fees in full, and then some. I was a work-study student, which gave me an edge when applying for on-campus jobs. I averaged 25 hours of work per week, and volunteers 5 hours a week. I was enrolled full-time with 16-18 credit hours per semester. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA undergrad, and 3.9 GPA grad from a great Big 10 school. I worked my ass off and wasn't truly burdened by student loans, knowing I could pay off the loans I took at any time. The money I did borrow went toward living expenses and into the bank, since it was interest-free while enrolled. The amortization graphs are based on [this](https://spreadsheetpage.com/loan/amortization/).

Honestly, not much has happened this year with the pandemic. My wife and 1.5 year old toddler basically stayed (and attempted to work) at home since March. Spending is pretty darn low (about 36% of our income) but we've been cooking some amazing meals. Missed some awesome vacations and have pretty much settled into a ""I never want to step into an office again"" mindset. This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on...well today(ish).

**This graph is for two people, not just me as of July 2015**

Since the last updated I've:

* Started a second Amazon Affiliate site that is now generating 2k a month with zero effort.
* Kept my toddler alive and unharmed
* Built an awesome outdoor kitchen with only the help of my wife

Some answers to common questions are below:

* This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 29 years old, live in Houston, TX and have a 1.5 year old. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference we currently have around 191k in equity in our home and owe 148k (total value of house is \~340k) . We have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. We do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good. We'll pay it off in around 3 years or so. If you include real estate we've got over a million bucks!
* We keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when we bought our first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and we bought our next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we no longer have.
* Our taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* We have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Wife bough a new car this year (ugh) but at least it was a good deal and is less than $500/mo I think. It does not impact our savings rates.
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -> 74K promotion ->97k old job -> 115k current job)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -> 84k promotion -> 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-> max IRA's -> invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -> pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",499,financialindependence

89,Realized Freedom Is More Than Money,,2265,koc0i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/koc0i5/realized_freedom_is_more_than_money/,1609510862.0,"A couple of years ago I got into FIRE and was ecstatic, as most of you were the first time you heard about it and realized ""wow, this can actually be done?!"". So of course, saving and investing became a big part of my life. Earlier this year however, something happened in my life and I decided to also start taking care of myself. Went on a diet, started exercising and have so far lost about 30 lbs.

I can now do 5K runs and I don't even feel it. It's nothing now. My goal is to work up to doing half marathons. Anyway, I recently started reflecting on what freedom really means to me. Freedom is not merely being able to give your stupid desk job the finger, or having the ability to spend your time as you wish thanks to material wealth accumulation.

Freedom is thinking about what you'd really like to achieve in life, and then going for it without fear, regret or what anyone else thinks. Freedom isn't having the option to eat cheeseburgers and doritos all the time, even though it technically is. The problem with doing so is that it separates you from the best version of yourself, and the best version of yourself is the freest form of yourself. Think about it:

The best version of yourself is the one YOU want to become. Want to be strong, athletic and have a nice body? Figure out what you need to do to get there. Take advice from guys who have what you want, replicate what they're doing, and eventually refine it such that it works better for you. This can only be done through self-discipline. Self-discipline = freedom, as Jocko Willink puts it.

FIRE is ultimately a mindset. Besides, as Charlie Munger once said: ""life is more than being shrewd at passive wealth accumulation"". Don't get me wrong, keep saving, folks. Just make sure you focus on maximizing your freedom in other areas of life as well. Imagine how freeing it is to be able to run long distances and not have to worry. You can just do it. It takes you places. You see things, scenery, people. You challenge yourself and it makes you feel good afterwards. THAT is true freedom.

90,Why I don’t want to FIRE as soon as possible.,,51,komsej,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/komsej/why_i_dont_want_to_fire_as_soon_as_possible/,1609547290.0,"Like many, when I first discovered FIRE I was consumed - I started tracking my spending, budgeting, researching investments and attempting to increase my income. Naturally, to begin I read and researched a lot, there was a lot to learn. I made some meaningful strides, and now have everything set in place, all I need to do is continue to save and invest and I’ll FIRE in 10 or so years. But I have continued to read, to research, to plan, to analyse, to overthink. This is not necessarily a bad thing but now I feel FIRE may be becoming too much of a focus - I’m too fixated on achieving FIRE above all else - and I think that will make me less happy.

Don’t get me wrong, I feel very lucky to have found the FIRE movement and to be able to confidently say I’ll be financially independent one day. What a gift that is in a world where most people constantly stress about money and are unsure if they will be able to retire.

My issue is feeling consumed by FIRE. Recently I found myself entertaining and working towards pursuing a career that will make me more money but would make me miserable (law). I started thinking yes I won’t like the work, it’ll be a tough corporate grind, but I’ll make more money and could FIRE faster so it’s worth it. I started putting FIRE as my number one objective and everything else, including happiness was secondary. This, in my opinion is the wrong way to think. 

I don’t want FIRE to be all about the destination, I want to enjoy the journey. I don’t want to work everyday until I’m 40 just to leave the workforce and say now I can start living. I want to go on long adventurous holidays, enjoy the work that I do, volunteer, spend my weekends with friends, focus on hobbies that make me happy - even though these things will slow down my path to FIRE. I don’t mind if I achieve FIRE 5 years later than I could have if I’ve enjoyed the journey twice as much along the way. Just something to think about. 

TLDR; achieving FIRE asap may be harmful to your long term happiness. You should enjoy the journey and not just the destination. Maybe consider doing some more fun stuff along the way 😊",41,financialindependence
91,Early Retirement Update (EOY 2020),,1002,ko2559,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ko2559/early_retirement_update_eoy_2020/,1609463330.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (with home/land). Our actual withdrawal rate is much less than the original 3% of portfolio due to: occasionally earning additional passive income; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (below). The budgeted maximum withdrawal amount for 2021 is $3,904/mo or $46,858/yr (now 2% of net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We’re so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an ebay business while in college ($10k), and student loans ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average. My parents initially promised to cover the student loans out of what they deemed to be principle, but we assumed them when purchasing their home/farm in 2019 ($380k + assumption of student loans + free rent for life, for an estimated $750k home/farm that is now probably closer to $900k).

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was initially 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents’ home/farm, our net worth is closer to 50% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another house with 66 acres) / 50% VTSAX (total US stock market). We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment, social security, other inheritances, universal health care, or universal basic income. The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**2020 RECAP**

**Spending**: Living expenses for 2020 came to $39,458 (max budget $41,736). We generated $8,045 of income this year from some almost entirely passive stuff. Our investment withdrawal was $31,413 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.51% for the year (max budget 2%). Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 1.89% for the year. Spending guideline for 2021 will be $46,858 (2% of net worth). Our net worth has gone from $1,333,772 (start) to $2,342,926 (current). Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out, got all of it back, and padded the portfolio even further. The New York Times reached out to me again in March to see if I was financially ruined, but I had to disappoint them.

**Experiences**: I ran nearly 2000 miles after my competitive running career came to a close (personal records: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). That’s way down from 3000 miles in 2019, but I switched over to cycling (2000 miles) primarily during the summer (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete). I allowed the pandemic and others’ imbecilic denial of reality surrounding the pandemic to make this a less productive year. I mostly stayed home and stuck with existing hobbies (reading, gaming, watching movies, web browsing, vintage card/nintendo collecting, hiking, bird watching, shopping for my parents, following the near demise of our republic). I even reapplied with my old employer and the state volunteer medical core to help with immunizations for the upcoming year, but I am apparently not wanted.

**Upcoming**: In 2021, I want to get vaccinated so that I can return to society, learn to swim effectively without a snorkel, learn to play some basic piano, look into becoming a race director, continue running for my physical/mental health, find some new volunteer opportunities, decrease my time in the digital world, spend more time with existing hobbies, make up for lost traveling (California #3, Hawaii #2, Japan #3), and continue to do whatever the fuck I want.",277,financialindependence

93,[2020] Year in review. Part 3 of my annual contribution to r/financialindependence,,15,kodzr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kodzr5/2020_year_in_review_part_3_of_my_annual/,1609518348.0,"Hello all, this year in review is something I've been contributing for a few years now. As long as it doesn't break any rules and we continue to get something out of it I would like to make it a bit of a tradition. There was some good advice given to me during last years submission and I've made an effort to clean things up a bit for this year. I love hearing your suggestions.

Here is a link to last year's submission: https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eio3lm/2019_year_in_review_pt_2_of_what_i_hope_to_make/

**Background**

For the last 5 years, at the end of the year I always crunch some numbers to see how our finances look in order to get a complete picture of our path towards financial independence. I add up all of our major assets, subtract all of our debts and come up with our net worth and find the year over year changes.

I then separately add up our retirement assets (essentially net worth subtracting home equity), figure out what our average monthly expenses were(we have tracked every single dollar in and out of our checking account using YNAB since February 2015 https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f83u0y/for_5_years_we_have_tracked_every_single/) and perform some rudimentary calculations to project how many years from being Financially Independent we are.

Note: I actually began tracking all of this in the middle of 2015. So there is a bonus 6 months at the start that can be more or less disregarded for purposes of looking at annual variations.

**2020 Financial Results**

On the whole our path towards Financial independence had a stellar year. Our investments performed great considering the current economic climate and we were able to make all of the tax advantaged contributions that were allowed us(401K/HSA/rIRA x2). This may be the last year we have access to IRA contributions in the full amount.

We really padded out our efund and are at the point where we are a bit cash heavy. Crunching our asset allocation in retirements accounts we are weighted roughly 75% domestic stock, 15% bonds, 10% international stock. Cash makes up slightly more than 10% of our net worth currently.

Our biggest wins this year were continued aggressive pay down of mortgage, continued building of emergency fund, and favourable market returns. The latter being primarily out of our control and so disconnected from what's going on concerns me, but I have no control over it and count my blessings. We also received a modest income increase(wife promoted, yay!) which helped slightly. 

We honestly didn't have any sort of real financial set back to note this year. Everything seemed to go our way in 2020. The only critique that I have is being so cash heavy, although given what 2020 was I'm not sure I would do anything differently.

I see upcoming challenges for next year being thus: 
* Possible loss of ability to contribute to IRAs due to pro-rata rule and income increases
* Reduction in cash position either by opening a brokerage account or more mortgage pay down
* Continued favourable market gains, surely the chickens will come home to roost eventually, maybe 2021 is the year?

    Net Worth Change: ~42% Increase
    Debt Change: ~22% Decrease
    Retirement Change: ~43% Increase
    Expenses Change: ~5% Decrease
    Savings Rate Change ~9% Increase

Final Savings Rate: 71%

Years until FI (change from last year): 6 (-4!)

**Final Thoughts**

We had a very lucky year overall. To not only keep both income streams(with modest increases and stimulus) during the pandemic, but also for markets to return such favourable and strong results was a financial blessing. On the non-financial side, we've both managed to be quite healthy and nobody that we know has really been all too effected by covid. That's what truly counts! 

From the financial standpoint it was mostly just ""steady as she goes"" other than a bit of rebalancing earlier in the year it's all just been on auto pilot. It's surprising to look back and see just how the year played out. I quite enjoy only doing this annually as a check in, automating most of it and trying not to pay any attention to the noise of any given quarter/month/week/day. Perhaps even annually is a bit much?

I'm hoping that next year is more of the same. Continue working, continue investing, and continue aggressive mortgage paydown. I'm going to try and reduce our cash balance a bit in the coming year, I would like it to be around $20k less. Gotta put those dollars to better work, and with conditions as they are now, Ally isn't working them nearly hard enough for my liking! 

I'm hoping that 2021 is a bit of a transitional year for me personally. I would like to focus less on work and more on starting to picture what a post-needing an income life would look like. Over the last few years we've been fortunate enough that I think we're at a point where we can more or less coast and while we can't completely take the foot off the accelerator at least we can maybe begin to stop holding it pinned to the floor and attempting to push it through the floorboards. That's very stressful. Physical and mental health has been rough in 2020 and need to be focused on this year. Beginning to feel old stinks!

If anybody has any questions or tips let me know. Good feedback is always appreciated!",37,financialindependence
94,Estimated Taxes - Annualized Income Tax Method Planning Spreadsheet,,33,ko31bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ko31bb/estimated_taxes_annualized_income_tax_method/,1609466879.0,"Link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJnEcpNJ7N2n5kLwvV6JfGpxrwX_DNfFSAc-j236P98/edit?usp=sharing

Please COPY the spreadsheet and don't request edit access.

Original credit goes to a Bogleheads user TaronM that made the original spreadsheet. I updated his spreadsheet for the Tax Jobs Cuts Act which the original poster wasn't willing to do, which took a lot of work as the annualized income forms changed significantly. 

I updated his spreadsheet as I'm on SSDI income and was wracking my brain trying to estimate taxes correctly for $0 penalties. I'm invested all-in on Hedgefundie's UPRO/TMF portfolio and re-balancing that can throw off significant capital gains every quarter. In one year I'm either $0 federal taxes or paying $40,000 in federal taxes solely due to rebalancing my portfolio. SSDI is tax free with $0 income, and up to 85% taxable otherwise. 

I looked everywhere for an online calculator or software package to spit out numbers and the only thing I found was a ""Please contact us for pricing"" offering. Being too cheap to hire a CPA for this and not wanting to do these forms once a quarter, with the workload of doing a tax return, I decided to do the work once and build upon what TaronM started. 

# Instructions
Make a copy for each new year from the template. 

Put in your tax brackets. I have the single tax brackets, if you're married, you'll have some work to do to put in the married tax brackets. Put your YTD date income for each ""quarter"", the first 3 months of income, the first 5 months of income, the first 8 months of income, then finally in December your total income.  You'll do this 15 days before the estimated taxes are due at each quarter and put your ACTUAL income received. 

Save this spreadsheet and refer to it at tax return time. You'll have to enter the same numbers you estimated in your tax program of choice for the annualized income method. 

You'll probably want to save this spreadsheet for 7 years with your tax return in case you're ever audited to show that you did the worksheet. My spreadsheet puts every number into the worksheet for you. 

Enjoy saving money of having to hire a CPA year round to do the busy work by hand and tell you how much estimated taxes you owe.

Cheers! 

# Limitations
It does no QBI phaseout rules, they're really complex. If you're self employed I trust you're putting in realistic numbers and knows how this QBI phaseout works. My spreadsheet will spit out whatever numbers you put in same as the Annualized Income Method forms itself. I have not tested this part extensively so YMMV on it. Remember: garbage in = garbage out. 

# Disclaimers

I'm not a CPA. I've only tested this for my expected situation of SSDI, ordinary income, dividends, qualified dividends, short term capital gains, and long term capital gains. I've tested this with 2019 tax brackets and a 2019 Tax Act Return. At most TaxAct generates a $1 or $2 penalty, which is a lot better than the $100-$200 in penalties I was facing with my previous attempts to figure out estimated taxes on my own.

# How this spreadsheet applies to FIRE 

We're more likely to retire early, and our income is based off our portfolios, and we may have uneven income in a year (say withdrawing $40k extra from stocks in June to fix a roof.) FIREing doesn't give us much withholding opportunities either - so we're either paying estimated taxes or doing 60-day rollovers of 100% withholding IRA withdrawals. Another poster yesterday was asking how to estimate such taxes and so I decided to post this today! :)",31,financialindependence

I understand the importance of having an emergency fund in something that won't lose value when your net worth is on the lower end, but what about once you've grown your net worth? If you have **years** worth of expenses invested in something like VTSAX, does it still make sense to keep 3+ months of living expenses in a savings account? 

Even with a market down turn, you'd still have access to several months worth of expenses if you initially had years worth invested.

103,What the pandemic taught us about personal savings,,526,km5ujq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/km5ujq/what_the_pandemic_taught_us_about_personal_savings/,1609211806.0,"Statista Link: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/246268/personal-savings-rate-in-the-united-states-by-month/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246268/personal-savings-rate-in-the-united-states-by-month/)

Obviously there are a number of reasons impacting peoples' ability to save money, but according to the Statista graph linked above, it seems like people have a lot more 'disposable' income than they think. If savings can skyrocket (*nationally*) 26% in a single month, clearly people can save more money *all* the time so they can actually make it for a few months on savings in case of an emergency. I'm not taking away from the suffering that countless people have been forced to endure, but a little bit of preparation likely could have saved (no pun intended) many from some of the tougher things they've had to go through during the pandemic.

I also think this graph is pretty resounding evidence against the argument that most people don't have room in their budgets to put more towards savings. Pandemic or no pandemic, the ability to increase savings so drastically and so quickly says something about where most peoples' money goes. I guess this spike could have been due to the CARES stimulus, but I don't think this is likely the case since I find it hard to believe that an extra $600 could have caused such a large spike in savings for so many Americans (I might just not be in tune with who exactly the 'average' American is though). Hopefully this whole pandemic experience encourages people to re-examine their financial health!",520,financialindependence

107,Beyond expense ratios and CAGR; why the intangibles of FIRE may matter more than the quantitative factors. My perspective based on ~8 years of early retirement.,,1382,kl4jm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl4jm4/beyond_expense_ratios_and_cagr_why_the/,1609079376.0,"I am submitting this post to promote discussion about what I believe to be potential dangers associated with the pursuit of FIRE and to highlight the importance of, *throughout your life*,  attending to the qualitative factors that I believe are essential to a successful retirement.  My goal is to encourage those of you on the road to FIRE to take whatever steps you deem necessary to avoid these potential pitfalls.  

 I believe that, for some, FIRE becomes some sort of amorphous goal that provides both a degree of hope, *as well as an excuse to avoid working on the aspects of life that really matter*: social connections, meaningful goals, physical and mental health. This is especially true for people who, while highly intelligent and well educated, are relatively less adept at enhancing and developing the qualitative aspects of life.

Some of you may remember me from my previous posts.  Recently I have started to  think more about what accounts for post FIRE happiness, meaning, fulfillment and health.   I believe that, just as it is important to devote X percent of your salary to an IRA throughout your life, it is equally important to devote X percent of your time to physical and mental health, maintaining or rekindling old friendships and cultivating new ones.  Failure to do so puts one at risk for an unfulfilling and unhealthy retirement.  

It's as if some FIRE aspirants are saying to themselves: “Yeah, I’m in poor physical health, depressed and socially isolated and I hate my job.  But that’s ok, because, one day……”.  But then that day comes; you are FI, but with nothing with which to fill the void.  I have seen this before.  Retirement is often accompanied by a huge let down.  Some become depressed and drink.  Some stay at home all day, every day leading to friction with their SO.  Some blow vast amounts of money on baubles in *a vain attempt to find some sort of justification for the decades they had sacrificed to get to this point.*

I am eternally thankful to my parents who were wise enough to facilitate and support my nascent hobbies and passions.  Because of them I had endless things to motivate me when I stopped working.  I am equally aware that my natural tendency to reach out to old friends, work colleagues etc. meant that I had a deep and wide pool of social support when I need it.  Nevertheless, I have struggled with periods of loneliness since I stopped working ~8 years ago, long before I had ever heard of FIRE.  My new girlfriend has both added tremendously to my life and strengthened my understanding of the vital importance of close interpersonal relationships.   

There are lots of young, highly educated people who are generally dissatisfied with the ‘rewards’ of their sacrifices.  They are exhausted by meaningless work, narcissistic supervisors, back stabbing colleagues and no identifiable path to a better work life.  They are left to ask” “Why the f**k did I sacrifice so much?  For this?”      

I suspect that, to varying degrees, most of the people who are aspiring to FIRE are life long hard workers who have, throughout life, been rewarded for delaying gratification and have received accolades for their performance.

Unfortunately, this focus on career progress can lead to a self-reinforcing dynamic if you devote so much of your time and resources to work that you never develop hobbies, you become socially isolated and your physical/mental health declines. 

I imagine that for more than one reader of this subreddit, your first three decades go something like this:  You buckled down in school and got yourself into a solid university.  You moved to one city for undergrad, then a different city for your first job…by the time you are 30 you are likely to be living in a city to which you have few ties, far from home, old friends and family and with little in your life other than work.  Eventually, you become dissatisfied with this life.  If only…..FIRE!  You begin to fantasize about the day when things will be *‘different’*, and you work ever harder so as to hasten the arrival of FI/RE.  This can lead to a dangerous and self reinforcing cycle in which the unrelenting pursuit of FIRE comes with further neglect of the qualitative factors that are playing a significant role in life dissatisfaction.  

FIRE is not a panacea that will address all of the root causes of your dissatisfaction.  That is a much more complex process. Meaning in life, like financial independence, can be compared to tending an orchard.  In both cases is imperative that you nurture your seedlings/trees regularly, over the course of decades and long before you plan to eat the fruit.  If you wait until you are hungry, you are in trouble. I know that this is easier said than done, but just as it is important to begin saving and investing early and well before your planned FIRE date, it is equally important to maintain health, social connections and meaningful, non career activities while you are working towards FI.


**TL;DR** 
The quantitative aspects of FIRE are arguably less important to a successful retirement than the various, and often neglected, qualitative factors. I believe that many FIRE aspirants are so motivated to attain financial independence that they don’t consider the potential negative consequences of pursuing the quantitative aspects of FIRE (e.g., savings rate, CAGR, etc.) *at the expense* of what are potentially more important qualitative factors (i.e. relationships, health, etc).",228,financialindependence

111,It is possible to have too much in Roth accounts (US-based),,7,kl6u9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl6u9f/it_is_possible_to_have_too_much_in_roth_accounts/,1609087941.0,"This is a PSA that it is possible to have too much in Roth accounts. It’s a somewhat rare occurrence, and there aren’t many blogs or other information about it, so I thought I’d post what I’ve learned and what I’ve done in hopes that it helps someone out there. 

**My primary piece of advice: Once you are >50% to your FI goal, please check to see that your allocations in your accounts are supporting your plan.** Take a look at the Roth conversion ladder, and put pen to paper on how you will withdraw the money you need in your years of retirement. My mistake was blindly putting my savings into Roth, and upon reaching my overall FI number, finding that if I want to utilize the tax benefits of the Roth, my allocation runs out of money for the 10 years before I’m 59.5 (when distributions from Roth are tax-free).

The common FI wisdom to max out retirement accounts first, and pointers to accessing retirement funds early all make the assumption that most of your retirement funds are in pretax accounts. And if you are primarily invested in pretax accounts, this entire post is not going to apply to you. All the conventional FI wisdom applies. This post only applies if you are overweight in Roth, and relatively light in both pretax and taxable accounts. 

I personally got here because I had invested early in Roth accounts, didn’t switch to Traditional until recently, and only really looked at the sum of all my accounts in the progress towards FI until I was about 80% to my goal. Some background, from my first comment with this account:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9i0h5/daily\_fi\_discussion\_thread\_august\_14\_2020/g1hrad5/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9i0h5/daily_fi_discussion_thread_august_14_2020/g1hrad5/?context=3)

Summary is that 2/3 of my investments were in Roth, and assuming I’d hit my number soon, the pretax and taxable buckets didn’t have enough to get me to 59.5 (20+ years from now). At best, using taxable brokerage funds and pulling out Roth contributions will get me through the first 5 years while I spin up the Roth conversion ladder, but then the pretax bucket will dry up in about 5 years, leaving a 10+ year gap until I’d be able to access Roth tax-free.

The alternatives I’d considered included:

* SEPP: One is allowed to set up substantially equal periodic payments from a Roth account, but this sucks for a few reasons. First, it requires careful accounting and compliance from when you start until 59.5. Breaking compliance levies large penalties, so it is rigid and inflexible. If you are one who can stick to the same budget and plan for 20 years, maybe it’s for you, but it isn’t for me. Second, I believe these payments will be taxed as income. Even though it comes from a Roth account, because I would not yet be 59.5, it does not receive the tax-free treatment (and recall, in this scenario, I’ve already pulled out all my contributions). I’ve seen a couple of blog posts that conflict on this, one saying it’s from Roth so it is tax-free, one saying it is taxed as income. In my read of the IRS document, it would be taxed as income prior to 59.5.
* Just take the penalty for early withdrawal: Yes, this is a possibility, but I’d be taxed at income rates, and also 10% as a penalty. Not ideal, and I’d like to avoid if possible. If my Roth were fatFIRE level, I may fold this into the plan. But it’s not at fatFIRE levels nor do I expect it to get there for decades. 

\**If you follow the primary advice, you won’t need the following, but if you find yourself over allocated in Roth like me, the following may be helpful.*\* I also recognize the below are slightly controversial and unintuitive, so if there are things I’m missing that make these suboptimal, I’m all ears. There aren’t many folks writing about this, so it’s not like I’ve had robust discussions on the pros and cons here. 

I still enjoy my job, so I’ve been continuing to accumulate, but I’ve made or am considering the following changes:

1. Stopped my (backdoor) Roth contributions. At the current investment levels in my Roth accounts, it will accrue (over 20+ years) to more than I can spend. So to me, it makes no sense to continue to send money there. 
2. Perhaps even more controversial is that I have made a CARES act withdrawal from my Roth 401k, in order to fund my taxable brokerage account. The CARES act allows families that have been impacted by COVID (my partner received unemployment earlier this year) to withdraw from retirement accounts up to $100K without penalty, but does require that you pay taxes on earnings (for a Roth 401k, they calculate what proportion is contributions and earnings, and you’d pay taxes only on the earnings portion). You can choose to pay the tax burden over 3 years, and you can also choose to pay the sum back to your retirement account within 3 years to levy no tax burden. Like I said before, my Roth totals will grow to more than I can spend, so this made sense for me. And if it turns out to be the wrong move, I can return the money to my retirement account within 3 years, and will at least have jumpstarted my taxable accounts in the meantime. If this sounds interesting to you, note that you would need to execute this before December 31st this year. This operation took me about 30 minutes with my 401k servicer to execute, so there is still time!
3. I am considering pulling out my Roth contributions next year to further enrich my taxable accounts. Again, all in service of shifting growth to support my early retirement, at the expense of funds I would access post 59.5.

A drawback here is that while I may contribute to the Roth in the future, I won’t be able to contribute for any years that have passed. Also, technically, moving funds from Roth to taxable means I’m giving up tax-sheltered space in order to create taxable gains. It sounds like heresy, but it makes sense if your Roth accounts, in combination with the time left until you are 59.5, leave you with more than you’ll ever need.",58,financialindependence

113,Any accountants in here already FIRE'd or on track?,,619,kkf8u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kkf8u5/any_accountants_in_here_already_fired_or_on_track/,1608970698.0,"Any accountants up in here? Would think by nature of our business that we are the more detailed-oriented ones, especially when it comes to a financial/numbers perspective. Just curious to hear more stories from accountants who are on the FIRE path.

Our career path and titles are pretty standardized so I would think the motions are very similar, but any tips/advice along the way would be great to hear about.

For me personally, I've done the Big 4 route as an auditor and am now in industry as an Accounting Manager. I'm making low six-figures. I live in a HCOL area and my savings rate is about 50%. I'm still in my early 30s with about $600K in net worth. Most of my net worth build was attributed to investing in the S&P 500 and appreciation of the home I currently live in. About half of my net worth is in investments, including 401K and Roth IRA. I max out my traditional 401K and Roth IRA annually, and am hoping to FIRE in my early 50s with about $2.5M. I recently started my own bookkeeping practice as a side hustle in hopes to accelerate that even earlier.

My personal advice echoes what this sub says time and time again, which is that the best time to invest was yesterday and the second best time to invest is today. I wish I wasn't feeling so certain a recession was coming in the 2010s and I know I missed quite a rally in my personal investment accounts by having too much money in cash. Nowadays, I have set up automatic investments of $500 every two weeks into my personal investment account (VFIAX fund), and my only regret is I am not putting more than $500 (still got a good chunk in cash as a safety reserve to hopefully buy a bigger home soon).",464,financialindependence
114,Purchasing homes and property to rent out is a terrible wealth and cash flow strategy for your future; I want to explain why to everyone.,,0,kl8ygk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl8ygk/purchasing_homes_and_property_to_rent_out_is_a/,1609094958.0,"TLDR provided :) 

First off I want to say that I’m not completely discouraging the purchase of a home. There are hundreds of reasons to buy a reasonable house besides just the money. 

A whole bunch of people think that this purchase and rental method is a smart move, but it involves extreme risk, for minimal reward. 

In addition to this, if anyone would like to see the full amortization breakdown and it’s comparison to typical bond rates in which I derived this data please shoot me a direct with your email and I can send you the excel document I created. This is also a useful tool for comparing or looking at any mortgage or estimating capital gain returns for anyone looking for an easy tool. 

First off I want to talk about home loans. Now I live in Seattle, and a 400-600k house is typically a decent three bed home in this market. I understand that some areas homes are incredibly cheap, but cheap areas exist because the work and rental market in the area has little to no demand, so keep that in mind. 

So for this scenario I’ll talk about a 450k loan with 50k down (although the down payment is irrelevant until we use it as beginning equity for a capital gains comparison) This loan will be at 2.5% over thirty years, the total cost of the home being 500K, and we’ll slash the real estate fees to make things simpler. This is a fantastic interest rate, you probably won’t get it. This will generate roughly a $1800 dollar mortgage payment for 30 years. In total you will pay roughly 200k in interest over the period. That’s 200k over 30 years you will be giving to the bank. What if you pay an additional $1,000 a month towards your mortgage? You still pay 150k in interest. So don’t think that saves you much. 

Home total net loss over 30= ($700,000) (principle and interest) 

Average yearly maintenance loss = ($7500) 

Average tax (1% property value) loss= Variable, but we’ll use the starting low, being a net loss of ($4500) a year for the whole period 

Total net loss over 30= ($700,000) + 30*(($7500)+($4500))= ($1,060,000)

Now let’s say you manage to rent this home for $3500 (nearly twice your mortgage) unfaltering for the 30 year period (which is impossible). Let’s also keep in mind that 500k homes don’t rent for $3500 a month, but I want to be as generous as absolutely possible. 

Net gain, rental over 30= $1,260,000

Total net gain, = (1,060,000) + 1,260,000= 200k 

But we can’t forget the most valuable piece of buying a home, and that’s the fact you own it, and it’s appreciating over the thirty year period. Typical home equity rates in the Seattle market increase by 3-5% a year, compounding we’re looking at about 100-200% increase in home equity value. 

Total net gain= 200k + (500k*200%) 

Total net gain over 30 years purchasing and renting a home with a absolute best case scenario = $1,700,000

Sounds great right? Why not take a loan on six homes and rent them out? Lots of geniuses did this before 08’ and there are more of them doing it now. These people don’t understand non-liquid assets like homes, and just how risky it is to overextend on the loans. If the market crashes, or demand is lost, you’re now paying for multiple mortgages with absolutely nothing to save you. All your savings will be gone in months, you’ll be forced to short sell to the bank, and you’ll lose your absolute ass. Let’s also mention how much time it takes to manage and get tenants, we’re talking thousands on thousands of hours of your time. 



So now let’s talk about liquid capital gains, or just the most basic low risk version of them. Typical mutual funds generate 5-15% a year, but we’re not going to compare this home rental strategy to mutuals, we are going to compare them to literally government T-Bonds. On average we’re looking at about 1.6% a year returns on these. Anyone that knows anything about investment can tell you that 1.6% a year is terrible. But that just goes to show how shit buying homes to rent out truly is. 

So what happens if you put the same amount of money that you would put into the home, into government T-Bonds? This is a liquid, little to no risk, no time asset. You just deposit your money every month, year, whatever, click out of your internet browser and go to bed. This is huge, you should always value your time as much as possible. 

So starting with 50k equity, if you put the same amount into T-Bonds every year as you would have the home, after thirty years you will have: 

Where $24,000= yearly cost of home mortgage
Where $12,000= yearly cost of tax and home maintenance; 
Where n= year since original investment

Y1= (50,000+$24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

Yn= (Yn-1 + $24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

If n=30, Total net value of investment value = $1,460,000. 

So when compared on paper to T-Bonds, the home rental option beats it by about 240k, but that is only under the most exceptional, unreadable, and perfect circumstances which again, are: 

1) The housing market continues at its current rate for the next 30 years 
2) There is never a month you pay a mortgage payment without rental income from the respective house 
3) You have a fixed interest rate at 2.5% 
4) You pay no real estate fees
5) it takes no personal work time to maintain the homes and tenants 

These five things are completely impossible, in other words, I’m comparing the absolute best housing scenario, with the absolute lowest return average investment scenario. This means that if you can pull a measly 1.6% a year from T-Bonds you will take on nearly no risk, and still make nearly the same amount of money you would buying and renting out homes. So don’t overextend on home loans, cause if things go to shit, so will your life. 

TLDR; Buying and renting out homes is a horrible, high risk wealth strategy, and some of the worst average return bonds and mutual funds will absolutely crush it with no effort over a 30YR period.",44,financialindependence

116,"I don't give people money anymore, now I only give advice",,376,kk2k3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kk2k3j/i_dont_give_people_money_anymore_now_i_only_give/,1608917127.0,"Merry Christmas. Thinking back on previous Christmases where I knew people fighting with their family and friends wanting money they made, I remembered a [comment I read in this sub about how to deal with that](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jfpl1o/being_stealth_when_people_know_your_job_titles) that I've also done as well:

> My mom would offer to help anyone in the family by offering a financial advice and if they would give her complete and full control over their finances, she would guarantee that she could help them save more money to afford the things that they want. Problem is, once she starts saying that you can't afford this and that and this and that, they all of a sudden don't need her financial help anymore and can figure it out on their own. They've also stopped asking for money from my parents since the ""help"" offered is tightening their budget instead of hers.

This is because just giving people money doesn't really help them understand how that money was gotten and why it's being given. You hear a lot of parables about this, like teaching someone to fish than giving them fish. This is due to [Economic Outpatient Care mentioned in the book Millionaire Next Door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door#Economic_Outpatient_Care):

> Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. Besides offspring observations resulting in Under Achievers of Wealth (UAW) children, EOC is a contributing factor to the passing on of the UAW belief. **Offspring who receive EOC have 98% of the annual income compared to their counterparts who are not recipients of EOC. In comparison, they also have 57% of the net worth.** EOC gives recipients a false sense of financial security. For this reason they purchase homes in upscale neighborhoods that exceed the recommended value according to their incomes. Thirty percent of American families live in homes valued at $300,000, yet only earn an annual income of $60,000.These homes then demand nice cars for the driveway, nice furniture for the living room, and a nice plasma TV to complement the furniture. These offspring also purchase and consume the EOC rather than invest it. If a dose of EOC is given on a regular basis, the EOC can actually be absorbed into the individual’s perceived annual income. Expenditures are then calculated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled dose of EOC.

In other words, giving money to people makes them less likely to try on their own. It just feels better in the short term but hurts them in the long term. I used to give out money initially but I curbed that and only started giving advice from then on.

A note about advice though, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. People don't really want to tighten their own living situation and make sacrifices, as you see in the [/r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence) thread above, they just want your money for free. I've told many people about basic financial advice and they just don't want to implement it. I tried to convince them in the beginning but now I just say, suit yourself. If I'm rich in a decade and you just spent it all on stuff, I'm honestly not sure what to tell you. I suppose in rare situations you can give money, but in my experience it never ended well.",267,financialindependence

119,Rethinking the increase of bonds in your portfolio as your NW increases,,60,kjiajc,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kjiajc/rethinking_the_increase_of_bonds_in_your/,1608827742.0,"So the standard advice for the equity / bond mixture is to increase bonds as you near retirement or another event where you have planned withdrawals.  It's reasonable advice in general based on volatility alone between the two asset classes and the tactic's main purpose is to avoid selling stocks when they're depressed.

However, if we pay attention to the part about **expenses**, this advice seems less relevant since your expenses doesn't scale 1:1 as your NW increases.   Jeff Bezos for example wasn't waiting for his NW to increase whether or not to buy a bigger yacht or island.  

Back to us regular folks...

Assume you start your retirement with a portfolio of $6MM and the you've been advised to have 10% of your NW in bonds/cash.  If you expected to have a $10k/mo spend in retirement and have $600k in your favorite bond or cash equivalents, you can ride out any stock slump for 5 years. 

The standard mixture of bonds is typically higher than 10%.

Assuming you're satisfied with this duration for any type of equity market recovery, why would you crank up the percentage of bonds in your portfolio in retirement just because your portfolio's percentage warrants you have more than $600k in bonds?

I already max my own traditional 401k plus megabackdoor and backdoor Roth contributions. My non-working spouse has 145k in an IRA (rolled over years ago from a 401k at her prior job -- we regret rolling over to the IRA now). I'd like to make spousal backdoor Roth IRA contributions for her. How to do this while avoiding the pro rata rule?

As I understand it, if my spouse rolls over her IRA into a 401k or Solo 401k, I should also be able to make spousal IRA contributions for her, and avoid taxes when converting those contributions to a Roth IRA.

The question is: what tactics can we use to roll over her IRA to a 401k to ""wipe the slate clean"" and avoid the pro rata rule when making backdoor Roth contributions?

Sure, she could get a ""corporate job"" with a traditional 401k and roll over into that. But we are not interested in doing that now (she is a SAHM for our three young kids).

Could she create a Solo 401k with minimal self-employment income (from surveys, eBay, etsy, whatever) and roll her IRA into that?

Has anyone actually gone to the effort of ""manufacturing"" self-employment income with the main motivating purpose being to open a Solo 401k?  If so, was it worth the effort for an additional 6k Roth contributions per year?

Any particular recommendations for Solo 401k providers?

Recently came across a blog site looking at Sustainable Withdrawal Rates (SWR), and the proportion of equity:bonds in investments over time (https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/11/09/what-is-wrong-with-target-date-funds/)

The argument is that the conventional rule of thumb as I understand it (i.e reducing equity:bond ratio with age) is not as an effective strategy compared to a ""bond tent"" (i.e. shift more into bonds before retirement as normal, but then quickly shift out of bonds again, to 80 or 100% equity, in retirement).

Has anyone come across this, or uses this themselves? I would love to know the community's opinion. 

Many thanks.

Many people born in my situation never put effort into anything. I’ve been reading books, trying to save money, seeking mentors/apprenticeships/resources since I was 13 (I’m 23 now). 

I’m at a loss. I’m traumatized, so it’s hard for me to trust. I don’t have transportation, or a house. I have ONE living family member who has Schizophrenia. I haven’t been homeless, but I’ve been staying in a friends laundry room for 2 months. There’s always a factor that comes up in my life that prevents security.

1.) Don’t have a car or license 
2.) Don’t have a house
3.) Don’t have financial literacy
4.) Don’t have a degree

Any advice is good. I wish I was anyone else daily. I’ve been asking this same question for months.

126,Thoughts on buy and hold on margin at 2.5% interest rate,,43,kij30u,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kij30u/thoughts_on_buy_and_hold_on_margin_at_25_interest/,1608687037.0,"Very interested in this community's thoughts on buying and holding a position in BRK.B now that margin rates have dropped at Robinhood from 5% to 2.5%. I expect a negative reaction, and even some quotes of Warren Buffett saying not to invest with margin. But I'm adding this post because there are some inherent advantages of pursuing FIRE that I think could make a small dose of this strategy a way to accelerate time to FI. For someone with no debt, a high savings rate, and an existing balance in a taxable account that I don't intend to withdraw any time soon, I'm wondering about the financial risks this position would expose me to.

Using round numbers here's an example:

\- Current account balance of $150,000 invested 100% between 4 individual stocks
- Margin allowance of +$125,000
- Invest $30,000 on margin in BRK.B indefinitely, no trading, no options, just buy and hold
- Total invested amount: $180,000
- Maintenance margin: $80,000 (MM is the amount of capital required in the account before needing to deposit more cash).

I understand this magnifies risk and increases downside in a down market. The goal would not be to take advantage of all of the leverage available, both to reduce risk of a margin call and increase the sleep at night factor.

**Upside:**  
\- Pretty simple, if BRK.B can grow more than 2.7% per year (2.5% interest plus $60/year for Gold membership), I come out ahead financially. This isn't a very high bar.

**Risks:**  
\- BRK.B falling precipitously along with all other stocks in the portfolio. The holdings would need to collectively fall by 55% in order to go to a maintenance margin situation. This could happen due to systematic risk (e.g. recession) or unsystematic risk (Warren Buffett passing away). I think these risks are somewhat mitigated by the margin of safety Berkshire enjoys, $100b in cash, and commitment to buy back shares.  
\- Margin rate increasing at Robinhood. If the interest rate increases, the hurdle rate is higher.  
\- Emotional attachment. Investing borrowed money could increase stress without discipline, and that has it's own cost even if I come out ahead financially.  
\- Getting greedy if this works near term, overextending to use additional leverage, and then encountering large losses

Again I don't expect positive reviews but I want them to be a little more reasoned than ""DON'T DO IT!"" What am I missing here? Has anyone else pursuing FIRE done this? How is this different from, for instance, keeping $30,000 in your mortgage at 2.5% interest rate while having $30,000 invested in a stock?

127,5 Years of Earning and Spending/Savings from Military Officer and Non-Profit Worker,,62,ki7mv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ki7mv7/5_years_of_earning_and_spendingsavings_from/,1608651538.0,"Hello,

We've been tracking our family's income and spending very diligently for 5 years now and wanted to share what that [looks like](https://imgur.com/a/PKhsV2v).

Background on us:

34M and 31F working in the US military and in a non-profit organization.  We have one child, hoping for more in the future.

I (34M), have always been a big saver and my wife has always been very responsible with money.  I found the FIRE community about the same time that we got married and the two events dovetailed well.  We have been boosting our savings rate over the past 5 years thanks to some lessons learned from this community.

Before I learned about the FIRE community, I was saving money because it seemed smart but did not have an end goal in mind, or really any idea on how much savings I actually needed.  We've developed a clearly defined goal over the past few years.  We are aiming for \~$100k in passive income when I retire from the military.  Roughly $47k of that will come from a military pension and the rest will come from our investments with a 3.25% WR.  We also want to be able to fully fund college for two kids at the in-state public university level.

Aside from really honing in on our retirement goals, the biggest development in the last few years has been tax minimization awareness.  We've paid way more in taxes than we needed to for the first 4 years.  But I finally figured it out this time around and we are using tax deferred savings to avoid the 22% tax bracket and actually do some tax gain harvesting to the tune of \~$20k this year.  In the military you usually hear the ""use Roth because part of your pay isn't taxed"" mantra.  This makes sense for a lot of folks, but I realized that 22% marginal tax rate is still a 22% marginal tax rate regardless of what career you're in.  So moving forward we will continue to use tax deferred savings to the max extent to avoid the 22% rate.

The use of tax deferred savings really helped this year as I also spent a significant amount of the year in a combat zone, resulting in tax free income.  We saved over $100k of our earned income and we will end up paying $3,800 of income tax on $210,000 of total income this year ($180k earned and $30k in capital gains/dividends).  That won't be repeatable in normal years but at least we can avoid some of the 22% bracket.

Hope this was entertaining/useful.",44,financialindependence

If you are maxing out your traditional 401K you contribute $19,500 (2020) pre-tax money. However, if you are maxing out your ROTH 401K you are contributing $19,500 after-tax money, which depending on your tax bracket can be \~$30,000 pre-tax money.

This leaves out one important thing: They *had* money to put into the market on the way down. If so, that also means they didn't have that money in the market *on the way up*.

Once you have your allocation set (e.g. 80% stocks / 10% bonds / 10% cash), you should stick to that allocation. Sacrificing your cash position (or worse, your emergency fund) to buy more stocks could work out well, but it could be a disaster too. And if you had extra cash just sitting around that was available to buy stocks, then you almost certainly missed the chance to use that cash in the run-up before the drop.

Don't time the market. Choose your allocation and stick to it. Dollar Cost Averaging is fine, but that should be an automatic process that is independent of what the market is doing.",297,financialindependence

135,Can we stop hating on people who reached FI in their 30s?,,15,khay8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/khay8n/can_we_stop_hating_on_people_who_reached_fi_in/,1608528501.0,"Every. single. time. someone posts how they reached FI in their 30s you will always get a sarcastic comment:

""Yeah bro just make $500K per year at age 22 and save 80% of it!""

""No worries just have parents give you $500K seed money at 18!""

Look, anyone in their early 30s who reached FI did via 3 ways or a combination of the 3

1. Lots of risk (Invested $20,000 in TSLA at IPO which turned into $2 million)
2. High income/high savings rate (Amazon dev @ 22 earning $150K + $150K stock options)
3. Luck (born into wealthy parents/seeder money given from parents/business that sold for milions\*)

\*Combination of luck, hardwork, great timing

&#x200B;

And none, I assure you, none of the 3 are easily replicated. If it was that **easy**, EVERYONE would be FI in their 30s.

So let's just stop hating on anyone who is FI in their 30s and accept that they did it via some combination of the 3.",174,financialindependence

138,"Who is planning to leave little to no estate, and how has that affected your FIRE number/planning?",,77,kg7k3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kg7k3b/who_is_planning_to_leave_little_to_no_estate_and/,1608383842.0,"I'm currently single with no kids, mid-30's. I'll collect a modest pension around age 50 and plan to have maybe 5-600k in savings by age 65. My plan is to buy indexed annuities at that time with my non-registered funds, which when combined with my pension should be enough for a comfortable retirement (a little under 4k/mo CAD). I also own my parents house and will live in the granny suite once they pass, renting the rest of the house to cover costs. CCP and OAS (Canadian Social Security) will be delayed to 70 to get the max payment.

I know annuities get a bad rap here but here's the benefits I see:

- simplicity, no calculation of SWR, no complicated tax planning, no asset balancing.
- very safe. At least in Canada, annuity plans have pooled insurance guaranteed by the government; about as safe as you can get.
-  guaranteed income no matter how long I live: I could live to 108 (like one of my great grandparents) and not worry about running out of money).
- higher SWR. With self managed funds I was planning a conservative 3.25% SWR. Annuities would pay 4-5%.
- protects your money from declining cognitive function, age related scams, greedy relatives.
- maybe more tax efficient, as prescribed annuities are considered to be mostly ROC (annecdotal, need to do more research)

Downsides:
- money is gone when I am
- inflexibility, can't withdraw a lump sum of needed
- some inflation risk, if inflation is higher than 2%.

My house will be left to my estate, but that's about it. As I won't have to worry about funding my retirement once the annuities are purchased, I can afford to be generous with my money while I am alive.

Of course my personal situation and annuity rates may be dramatically different in 30 years, but I won't be buying annuities until age 65 so I have plenty of time to adjust course. Even if I have kids though, I feel like a paid education and maybe help with a house downpayment is all they should expect to get.",82,financialindependence

I’ve been a long-time lurker here since I discovered FIRE back in 2014, but I’ve rarely posted. I hit $1 million earlier this year, and I wanted to share my story and hopefully exchange some valuable insights with you. It has taken me a while to work up the courage to share, but here goes. I’ll try to keep it fairly short and simple, although I apologize in advance for the long Background section, and I’ll follow up with more details as they come up in the discussion.


***TL;DR: I’m 34, single, watch collector, no children (and don’t plan on having any if I can help it). My NW reached ~$1 million at the end of August 2020. I increased my liquid net worth from zero to $850,000 in 6.5 years, and I aim to reach my FI number of $2.5 million by age 41. I don’t hate my job, but I do hate that it keeps me from staying fit and active, so the sooner I become FI the better. Look at my charts. Ask me questions or for more charts. Thank you for reading!***


**Background**

I grew up middle class in a developing country (Middle East) as an only child. I was privileged to have parents who were more than willing to forego most pleasures in life—including travel, nicer cars, etc.—and to instead spend every penny they had to make sure I received the best education possible. They put me in a private American school and paid for my college education, but they also were not the absolute savviest with money.

My health and education came first for my parents, but what came a very close second was every little whim and desire I had as a child—they spoiled me. They almost never invested, and instead spent all their extra money on whatever clothes, computers, videogames, music CDs, cameras or extra pocket money I wanted as a teenager. They found it very hard to say no to me. Because of this I grew up not knowing or appreciating the value of money, and by the time they (involuntarily) retired in their 50s they had virtually no savings.

What’s done is done, right? By the time I woke up to all this in 2013, I was 26 years old and armed with a pretty good education, but I hadn’t exactly been all that successful since graduating in 2008. I had gotten my CPA back in 2009 and was working at a public accounting firm making a measly $12,000/year (yes, that low, because developing country).

I hated my job, mainly because of the people I worked with, but I won’t get into that in any great detail. There was just a big gap between the way I had learned to work in a private/American education and the way I had to work ‘out in the real world’. I also had not been promoted in several years because I was seen by my peers and supervisors as a poor team player.

**Anyway, in early 2014, everything changed!** Thanks to the way my education and career start looked on paper—and thanks to LinkedIn Premium which I was (and still am) paying $30/month for—I was headhunted for a financial controller position in an east African country. This of course meant leaving my family, my city and my friends, and starting all over. To me this was all very new and scary, but it was almost a complete no-brainer. The move was to propel me from $12,000/year to $75,000/year + all the benefits that come with an expat position.

One thing that made it even easier for me to work abroad was my U.S. citizenship, which I got from my father’s side of my family. Anyway, I packed everything that mattered to me in a few suitcases and got on a one-way flight. My liquid net worth was negative at the time; I had $25,000 worth of credit card debt, plus more owed to my parents. I paid it all off within a few months of moving, but my parents later refused to let me pay them back what they’d contributed for an apartment back in my hometown. The apartment cost about $115,0000 and they’d paid for half of it. I still own it.

Since I made that move in 2014, I have made two more moves to other countries, and I’ve grown to quite enjoy my job and responsibilities. I’ve been promoted three times, and each promotion or move has come with a salary bump. I am now a CFO and my income has steadily climbed from the $75,000 in 2014 to $110,000 now in 2020. In addition to that, I get a ~30% performance-based bonus, and a 6% retirement benefit, plus company-paid housing, furniture, utilities, car, gas, internet, phone, house help, gardener, and two flight tickets home per year.

I’m fairly happy with how I’ve done over the past 6 years, but I look back and I still think to myself: What if I hadn’t been so spoiled? What if I’d learned the value of money earlier in life? What if I’d saved my money and started investing at the age of 21 instead of 27? Where would I be now?


**Current financial position**

I have an insane Excel spread sheet I’ve been developing and using for the last 6 years. I track every dollar I make or spend, every stock I buy, and hundreds of metrics. I do it religiously, and it’s made it very easy to pull numbers out to share with you guys.

In [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/tUgIRIN), my total net worth over time is in orange, and my liquid net worth is in black. The green line is my stock portfolio.

[This table](https://imgur.com/ny564mj) breaks down my current net worth near the end of 2020 and each of the previous 6 years. I’ve kept things pretty simple and my stocks are split between two individual accounts with two brokerages—there’s no 401k or IRA of any kind. As a U.S. citizen with no home base in the U.S., I get to exclude much of my income under the FEIE rule, but it also means I can’t contribute anything to a tax-advantaged account.

***EDIT: Several of you have pointed out an error I've made in the original chart and table. I erroneously included in my illiquid net worth (from 2014 to 2016) a separate property that my parents owned until 2016. I was tracking the value of that property in my spreadsheet before it was sold in 2016, but it was never a part of my own net worth and it shouldn't have made its way into the table and chart.***

***I've updated the [table](https://imgur.com/a/Dr2n09G) and [chart](https://imgur.com/a/KTdZoDH). Thanks for pointing out this error!***

These are currently my 6 largest stock positions:

|**Stock**|**% Gain**|**Value**|
:--|--:|--:|
|**TSLA**|+411%|$ 100,400|
|**NFLX**|+43%|$ 79,800|
|**AAPL**|+51%|$ 77,000|
|**FB**|+281%|$ 61,200|
|**AMZN**|+104%|$ 48,100|
|**MSFT**|+62%|$ 39,300|
 
[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/RYsIKmP) shows my income and how much of it I have spent/saved since 2014. I had a particularly low savings rate in 2016 and 2017 because in those years I pursued (and paid mostly out of pocket for) an expensive top 20 MBA degree. I find out more and more every day that this degree is (and will probably continue to be) completely useless to me, and that the ~$85,000 I spent on it would have been much better invested in the market. My CPA is what I need for my job, and my company never cared whether I got an MBA degree.

You can also see evidence of a fair amount of lifestyle creep between 2018 and 2020 in the chart below. In some years I travelled more than others, but generally my living expenses now hover around the $25,000/year mark.

I’ve also been very fortunate to have invested during the recent insane bull run, and [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/gNgO1wn) shows just how much it has helped my net worth over the last couple of years.

You can see in the chart that as of now near the end of 2020, I have invested a total of $300,000 into the stock market, and my portfolio’s estimated value at 12/31/2020 is $680,600. This makes for a total return of 121%, and I’ve calculated an annualized return of over 50% based on the timings of each of my deposits into the brokerage account.


**The way forward**

I feel that I’ve had a great deal of success over the past years, and I attribute most of it to a great ability to save thanks to the way my compensation has been structured and the FEIE. I do, however, recognize that the current market conditions which have allowed my net worth to climb as rapidly as I show in the table below will not necessarily last.

|Year|Net Worth||
:--|--:|:--|
|2014| 248,300||
|2015| 309,400|+25%|
|2016| 252,600|-18%*|
|2017| 379,700|+50%|
|2018| 457,100|+20%|
|2019| 676,000|+48%|
|2020| 1,071,000|+58%|
**Large decrease in NW due to severe drop in Dollar value of property valued in a foreign currency which suffered severe valuation in that year.*

I’ve calculated my FI number at $2,500,000, which I believe would allow me to live comfortably and be able to spend up to $80,000/year in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Based on my current and expected future salary, as well as my expected future savings rate. I’ve also calculated that I can likely achieve my FI number at age 41. Some of my assumptions include a 49-year retirement, average inflation of 2.6%, an annual contribution to my investments of $110,000 (adjusted for inflation), pre-retirement market return of 7%, post-retirement market return of 6%, fixed income return of 5.5%, percent in equities is 110-age (so it changes every year), and annual expenses of $80,000, which decline by 2%/year after age 65.

I guess one other thing I'm grateful for is that I'm not stuck in a loop trying (and failing) to get rich quick like I see some of my friends doing. I'm glad I'm taking the slow and steady path, and that I have the patience and discipline for it.

I’m very happy to get into discussions and answer questions. There are many more charts, calculations and concepts I’d love to discuss and share. The only things I do not want to be asked are 1) what countries I’ve lived/worked in, and 2) what companies I’ve worked for. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to read my story, and I’d love to hear your comments!

EDIT 2: Thank you to everyone who has read my post and engaged in a meaningful exchange with me. Whether we agreed or not, I appreciated the discussion. And thank you, strangers, for the wholesome awards!",608,financialindependence

141,"I created a little calculator to figure out exactly what my 401k contribution election should be to front load it early each year, reach the annual max, and still get the full employer match.",,87,kfpzys,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kfpzys/i_created_a_little_calculator_to_figure_out/,1608314064.0,"I’ve always tried to “front load” my 401k contributions to reach the annual limit. By that I mean contributing comparatively more early in each year for about 3 months to get more money in the market sooner, and then dropping the contribution election down for the rest of the year.

The problem is trying to calculate exactly what the contributions should be for each month was always a headache and was usually more of an educated guess than a reliable calculation. The reason it gets complicated is because with most employers, you don’t want to reach the annual max prematurely during the year because then if you stop contributing, you lose the employer match for the rest of the year. That is, most employers will only offer the match on paychecks from which you also made a contribution, so you need to contribute from *every* paycheck each year. So it’s usually a bit of guessing and shooting a moving target trying to maximize your contributions, reaching the limit, while still maintaining the employer match through the end of the year.

After not being able to find any calculator or formula online for what I was looking for, I decided to sit down and create my own. This calculator tells you what percentage to set your contribution election at to “load” your 401k as much as possible over a time period you specify, e.g. 3 months. After that “loading period” you’ll drop your contribution election to the minimum required for your employer match, which will continue through the rest of the year while staying below or at the annual contribution limit. Even if you don’t want to front load, input 12 months and the calculator will tell you exactly what your contribution election should be to reach the maximum annual contribution.

This is the first iteration. I’m neither an Excel wizard nor a designer, so I’m sure this spreadsheet can easily be improved and can be made more visually appealing. It’s not perfect and it’s pretty crude, but it seems to get the job done for what I wanted out of it. Hopefully you find it useful. If you have any suggestions for obvious improvements, drop a comment and I’ll look into adding it. Click the links below for direct download.

Hello everyone, I've been following this subreddit for almost 2 years and recently hit a milestone I wouldn't have reached this early if it wasn't for all of you. I wanted to give my thanks, as well as show you how I ended up where I am for anyone interested in reading. 

Current financial breakdown: 

- Checking Account: $3201.89
- Savings Account: $19,199.92
- Investment/Retirement Accounts:$78,736.47 

TOTAL: $101,138.28


2016 ($14k NW end of year) 

[June]  - Just graduated from highschool and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. With college application deadlines coming to an end very soon, and having my teachers, guidance counselors, and parents rush me to make up my mind, I randomly decided to take an accounting major in college because I heard it was in demand. 

[September] - Began my first year of college as well as maintaining 30+ hours at the grocery store I was working at throughout highschool. 

2017 ($31k NW end of year) 

[February] - First semester of college was coming to an end and I was completely miserable. The work was not difficult, the load was not too much for me, but deep in my stomach it just felt so wrong. I knew it wasn't for me and I began showing symptoms of depression because of it that even my close friends began to notice 

[April] - After 2 more months of feeling unmotivated and depressed I decided to pull the plug and drop out. I had no plan B, it was a spur of the moment decision and it felt like the 1000lbs I was carrying on my shoulders was finally gone. 

[June] - Spent the last 2 months working at the grocery store full time and my parents were fed up. We we're arguing every day because of my decision to drop out and after a heated argument they kicked me out the house at 19 years old. 

[July] - Spent 2 weeks with a friend while looking for a place. Ended up finding a basement apartment for cheap and moved in. I knew the minimum wage grocery store job wasn't going to cut it so I found an ad for a construction labourer position paying slightly higher ($35k/yr) and got hired. I spent the rest of the year slaving away and saving every penny I could. I was living VERY cheaply 

2018 ($46k NW end of year) 

(June) - After almost a year of working my ass off, starting earlier then everyone, staying later then everyone, coming in on the weekends to sweep and clean up, the company owner began to be very fond of me and gave me the position of Lead Labourer. This new position almost doubled my income, putting me at $60k/yr. Although the massive pay increase tempted me to splurge, I continued living as if I was still making $35k, and dumped all the extra money into my investment accounts. 

2019 ($72k NW end of year) 

(January - December) - This year not much changed. I was working the same job and still living in the same basement apartment alone. I continued living extremely frugally and was focusing on adding as much money to my investment accounts as possible, even if that meant sacrificing things I really wanted. 

2020 (101K NW end of year) 

(March) - Bought a car for $11k as a birthday gift to myself as I was tired of taking the bus. 

(April) - COVID hit, but thankfully I was able to continue working, most weeks actually working more hours then usual. 

(September) Been working consistently the whole year with no breaks or shutting down due to the virus. The same company owner that gave me a promotion in 2018 asked me if I'd like to train to become a crane operator and I gladly accepted. My wage will remain the same, but once I'm fully certified in about 3 - 4 years I can expect $120k/yr. 

(December) - Just deposited the cheque that puts me at $101k NW! Thank you all for the motivation!",303,financialindependence

I'm considering a $320k mortgage on a $400k listed home after a 20% down payment on a home. I have two quotes, a 15 year @ 2% and a 30 year at 2.5%. (Moving from Bay Area to L/MCOL area.)

The 2% 15 year is $2,059/mo. A 2.5% 30 year is $1,264. My income is $15k/mo after taxes, so both are extremely easy affordable. 

I'll look at a FIRE date of 10 years and a typical FIRE date of 15 years. 

Normally I'm an ""invest the difference"" kind of guy. It should be easy to find an investment that yields more than 2.5%, right? However, the 15 year is so cheap in monthly payment too, which quite frankly, is rare. It's tempting me. The $1,264/mo payment stream at a 3% SWR is $505,600 nominal to avoid sequence of returns risk. That is a lot of portfolio to carry around that investing the difference may not overcome. 

Investing the difference may or may not pay off either - I'll be using cherrypicked dates and investing in 100% stocks in  VFINX - Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. (For today - why invest in 1.5% bonds when you have a 2-2.5% mortgage to tackle?). 

# Mortgage Payoff Results 
At year 10 of the 15-year mortgage the payoff is $117,483.53      
At year 10 of the 30-year mortgage the payoff is $238,606.83       
           
At year 15 of the 15-year mortgage the payoff is $0.      
At year 15 of the 30-year mortgage the payoff is $189,622.47     

# Investment Results of Investing the $795/mo Difference

1985 - 10 years later: $173,324              
2000 - 10 years later: $98,854      
2002 - 10 years later: $122,926      

1985 - 15 years later: $646,159 - wow, over our SWR value!       
2000 - 15 years later: $272,352          
2002 - 15 years later: $299,635      
       
10 years cost basis: $95,400       
15 years cost basis: $143,100  

# Lots of Math figuring out after-tax payoff values
Under the worst case year 2000 stock market case we're at:        
238,606.83 30 year payoff - ((98,854-95400) *.85 + 95400)= 140,270.93.    
117,483.53 15-year payoff -140,270.93 = -22,787.4 worse than the 15 year mortgage.         

Year 2002: $119,809.73 payoff after taxes, -2,326.2 worse than the 15-year mortgage - break even.
Year 1985: $76,971.43 payoff after taxes,  $40,512.1 BETTER than the 15-year mortgage.  

All 3 portfolios have returned higher than the year 15 payoff. I'll just focus on the worst case and see if the taxes can possibly change the result:

238,606.83 - ((272,352 -143,100) *.85 + 143,100) = -14,357.37 payoff amount (credit). We're AHEAD $14,357 by investing the difference.

# TL;DR

Invest the difference 10 years - 1985 start date - Huge winner         
Invest the difference 10 years - 2000 start date  - Huge loser            
Invest the difference 10 years - 2002 start date  - Breakeven      

Invest the difference 15 years - 1985 start date - WINNER CHICKEN DINNER - SWR hit         
Invest the difference 15 years - 2000 start date  - Winner         
Invest the difference 15 years - 2002 start date  - Winner         

A 15 year mortgage really warrants consideration if it's affordable, and your FIRE date is under 10 years. If given enough time, yes, it is mathematically advantageous to invest in the difference, but the shorter you're desiring a paid off house before your FI date to avoid a much higher SWR requirement, the more advantageous the 15 year becomes compared to the short-term possible riskiness of the stock market (or buying the $400k house in cash vs keeping a $505k portfolio invested in SWR terms).

Going through this exercise made me re-think the 15 year mortgage for my FIRE goals.",432,financialindependence

148,Is The Munger Threshold Commonly Tracked?,,418,ke6ltj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ke6ltj/is_the_munger_threshold_commonly_tracked/,1608113372.0,"I enjoy all the spreadsheets and random financial statistics tracked and shared here. This sub seems to be about the only place on the planet where enthusiasm for tracking such things as 4%, fatfire, leanfire, coastfire, and networth numbers is normal.

For some time I have been tracking a statistic which I thought was useless and uninteresting. I never knew what to call the number nor did I have any useful rationale for tracking the number. However to my amusement, I was surprised to hear none other than investing great Charlie Munger refer to the same statistic in his recent CalTech Interview.

Does r/financialindependence/ already have a name for this number? If not, I propose to honor one of investing greats and dub it  ***The Munger Threshold…***

**Munger Threshold**

noun:

the amount of working time between your first working day earning income and the date on which your networth exceeds your cumulative earned income.

example:

Mr. Munger's. **Munger Threshold** was 13 years. You can hear him tell the story at the link below. Mr. Munger had an ""army of children to feed"" and this responsibility caused him to work in the family law practice. After 13 years working and squirreling away savings he discovered his investment portfolio exceeded the total of his earned law income. Therefore, Charley Munger's **Munger Threshold** was 13 years.

calculation:

munger threshold = munger date - first working day

related:

munger ratio = Networth/Cumulative Lifetime Earned Income

munger date = the date on which Munger Ratio = 1

It's also a post for seeking any advice that you think I could possibly use, and to formally document the start of my FI journey.And maybe even help someone who finds themselves in a similar position as me.

\[CROSS POST\] I have posted this in a few other subreddits.  I was told by a commenter that  I would get more constructive feedback here. If this is not allowed then please remove it. I'm new to reddit and still figuring things out.

**TL;DR**

* Started an Amazon Publishing Business back in 2016 that became *wildly* successful in a very short time period, earning upwards of $50K on our best month. Foolishly decided to travel the world with my fiancé and become a *""Digital Nomad""*, living extravagantly in a different city every 2-3 months. Had a blast but didn't save a penny and spent pretty much everything, every month all while slowly neglecting our business - the only source of income we had.
* At the age of 31 (fiancé 29), I've got $6k to my name with hardly any income (*our main Amazon account recently got shut down)* and my fiancé and I are now living at my Moms place back home in South Africa. *\*sigh\*.*
* Now on a mission to reach FI and fully committed to do *whatever it takes* to get there.

After receiving a decent amount of hate on my previous posts I thought I'd add disclaimers to those that read further.

\[DISCLAIMER 1\] The amounts are not exact, just as I remember them - but they are close enough. If I write a blog one day and enough people are interested I will dig into my bank statements, get exact amounts and post the screenshots of my biggest months/biggest expenses.

\[DISCLAIMER 2\] This is no way a bash on Digital Nomads or the lifestyle in general. It works and is possible, if you are intelligent and do it right. I was just dumb. Period.

**\*\*\*Scroll to the bottom of this post to if you would like to see my questions and have no interest in  reading my** ***""sex, drugs rock and roll""*** **story.\*\*\***

Time to swallow my pride. This is going to be a very embarrassing post for me, but I feel like I need to share it and get a *real with myself*. To put everything on the table, and also get a kick in the ass from this community with some added accountability - and hopefully advice from those who have achieved FI and have had similar experiences.

The last 4 years of my life has been a fun, wild and very expensive ride - one filled with lots of amazing moments, but also filled with insanely stupid financial decisions.

I'll start from 2016, Just before I decided to start my online business. My story began like many others do. I was working a low paying job in my home country of South Africa and wasn't entirely happy, ditto for my girlfriend *(now fiancé).*

I didn't quite hate it but I definitely was not fulfilled or earning the kind of money that I wanted. I got the taste of travel from when I took a gap year after university in 2013, and from then on I knew that I didn't want to be stuck in one place for the rest of my life.

So I started looking for other options -ones where I could travel and work at the the same time. By some stroke of luck I overheard a conversation at work about a book called *The 4 Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss* and it immediately hooked my attention.

*""Work 4 hours a week while traveling the world? Are you kidding me? Now thats sounds like the dream!""*

I immediately went out and bought a copy, devouring it in 2 days. It completely changed the way I looked at work, and shattered my paradigm about the way most people live life. I knew that this was the kind of lifestyle I have been yearning for all along.

I started voraciously researching how to make money online and eventually stumbled upon a super cool, hip subculture of people called *Digital Nomads*. Their ideas and values resonated with me so much that I became hellbent on becoming one. My north star was to become location independent, and work whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted - all I needed was my laptop.

In my research I found Amazon Publishing, which seemed like the most a straightforward online business model:

1. Find hot non-fiction niche on *Amazon*.
2. Hire professional writers to create content on said niche.
3. Purchase the content from them, and self-publish the content on *Amazon*.

To top it off it seemed very *passive*, with the books continuing to make money for years without much further work once up on the platform. I bought a $67 course,  did it within one week and took massive action with my girlfriend. We started seeing results right out of the gate and within the first 3 months I quit my job, as soon as I saw my online income had overtaken my traditional job.

My girlfriend soon followed suit  - we where working at the same company.

Things really started to take off after the 6th month at it, and we got into a niche that was absolutely on fire. We couldn't believe our eyes when we had our first $50K month. Coming from a low to middle class background we had never seen this kind of money in our lives. This was more than our parents made in one year combined.

I felt like I was *unstoppable, on top of the world* and the money could never run out. We booked a one way flight to Thailand to begin our *Digital Nomad* adventure. I soon proposed to my girlfriend on little seclude beach island in the  South Thailand, she said *yes!* Life was nothing short of perfect.

I bought my parents flights from South Africa to come celebrate our engagement in Thailand. This is when things went south. Long story short, my dad drowned in a freak accident while snorkelling in Koh Tao, Thailand. It was an absolute  nightmare trying to get my dad's body back to Cape Town, and my distraught and delusional Mom onto a plane without him.

This is when the the idea of *""life is and fragile"",* and *""live in the now""* belief was solidified in my mind.

It made me question the point of saving money, *if I could die tomorrow*. This false belief was very bad news for my spending habits. I began to spend money *emotionally*, trying and cover the pain of loss with a bunch of experiences and material ""stuff"".

We put our wedding off for months, not wanting to have it at such an emotionally sensitive time.

After spending some time at home to help my mother recuperate we soon hopped on the travel bandwagon again. We quickly got sucked into the *""travel lifestyle""*. Spending more than 90% of our income most months became the new norm - despite earning an average of 15k/pm profit.

We bounced all over Asia, living in places like the island of Ko Lanta in *Thailand, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Bali* and visiting places like *Dubai, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia.*..the list goes on. It was all 5-star hotels, lavish AirBnB's, business class flights, high-rise luxury condo's, expensive pool villas and *beachfront apartments.*

We spent thousands of dollars on new iPhones, Apple Watches, the latest and greatest Macbook Pro's, $5000 Sony Cameras and DJI drones - *half of which I hardly ever used.* If there was something we wanted we just went out and bought it. *Because we could afford it right?*

We made all of the other rookie errors such as eating out at overpriced restaurants *3 times a day* , drinking expensive green tea lattes from *Starbucks* and paying way to much on fancy gym contracts when there was a cheaper option for a fraction of the price.

The real gasoline on the fire was social media. This was keeping up with the Joneses **-** but on steroids, fuelled by scrolling through the Instagram feed and comparing ourselves to our new *“travel influencer”* friends.

Hedonic adaptation lead us to always be chasing the next new thing. Each experience needed to be bigger and better than the last.

I started to noticed that my income started to decrease month by month as we focused less on work and got distracted by the *constant travel, new friends and novel exotic experiences.* This was the catalyst to get me me thinking about my exorbitant lifestyle expenses - *maybe, just maybe, the money could run out?*

I lowered my spending considerably, but definitely not to the level I should have . The ""*shiny object syndrome""* took hold, and I started trying a bunch of new online business models - from affiliate marketing to Social Media marketing - in order to make money *as fast as possible* and get back to our original income.

**This was a massive mistake.**

Instead I should have just focused on the tried and tested Amazon business that was still giving us pretty much passive returns in the background. I spent over $30k on running Facebook ads while trying these other new online business ventures - and got *less than half* of the capital back in sales.

Then I hit another very big speed bump. Some bad tax advice got me to assume that I was tax exempt- since I was technically not residing in any country for more than a 3 month period. WRONG. I got hit with *huge* tax bill, which extracted another $40k from my collapsing profits.

Fast forward to March when COVID hit and I decide it was time to throw in the towel and head back home to South Africa, after my 3rd stint in Bali, Indonesia. With the developing situation and my businesses output decreasing at an exponential rate I thought it to be the smartest choice.

I booked our flights home with my income dwindling and my tail between my legs. I had around 20k in the bank and knew I had to re-focus in a place where I could control expenses and not be distracted by constant travel and stimulation.

Then just a month ago I lost my main Amazon Account due to copyright issues with on of our writers. This was a particularly hard blow, since I recently invested  thousands of dollars into it - which I won't see a return on.

Its been quite the rollercoaster of ups and downs, which has now been brought to a grinding halt. I find myself living at home with my Mom at the age of 31 with little income or savings. The situation is depressing to say the least, but I'm trying to keep my head up, and every grateful for finding the FIRE community 2 months back (although I wish I found it earlier).

I 'm also aware that I am most likely being a big baby, and others have gone through far more dramatic experiences this year. First world problems -  I know. I still have a roof over my head and food in the fridge, so who am I to complain - this is just my story and I thought I'd share.I welcome any comments that will bitch slap the perspective back into me. I probably need all the boot I can get.

I'm also well aware that there are plenty of people living the Digital Nomad lifestyle in a perfectly sustainable way - I was just a moron in the way I approached and executed it.I  personally know people that are *thriving* using geoarbitrage so this is not way a bash on digital nomads. Again it's just my story.

Looking in the rear view mirror makes me disappointed, thinking of what could have been. I know I could have had very similar, rich experiences as I did - just not having *haemorrhaged* all of of that money. But I also know that living life in regret is not going to get me to the goals I now have, and I'm keeping positive - looking forward to re-write this storyIn retrospect, I made t*oo much money too quickly* and having no financial literacy screwed me over big time. That self-sabotage,  the inability to process a traumatic experience in a productive way. Lesson learned.

I've now gone full-on frugal, track everything that leaves my wallet and I'm watching my expenses  - the variable I can most control - like a hawk.

What my fiance and I have now come to realise is  that our priorities have shifted over the past 4 years from *""adventure and excitement""* to *""security and contentment"".*

**GOALS & ACTION STEPS TAKEN SO FAR:**

My  fiance and I have determined our new priorities and  what we value most in life , this is our list:

*- Exploring, creating and capturing memories*

*- Time with friends and family*

*- Good hearty food, coffee and wine.*

*- Quiet mornings with our own space*

*- Healthy, Gym, Sauna and the Outdoors (surfing for me)*

*- Learning new skills and creative time*

*- Feeling financially secure and independent*

&#x200B;

1. I've calculated my leanFIRE number to be $780k which is probably not that accurate since I  went back and ignored big expenses  that I know I will never incur again, and calculated from there. I've decide to round this number up up to $1M since my fiancé and I are planning to get married, have at least one child and move to Portugal within the 6-7 year time frame while attempting to achieve this goal. Also, the a goal of $1M sounds a lot better and  I like round numbers. Again, I know this is probably not entirely accurate and based on projections, but my type-A personality works better if I have a clearly defined goal to work toward.
2. On the expense side of the pie I've identified the seeming force multipliers (the 80/20's) to achieving FI with regards to expenses, which seem to be housing and car payments - please correct me if I'm wrong here, or if I'm missing something. Rent while living with my mom is minimal ($260 a month), which covers her utilities and then a bit extra for her. Super grateful for this as I know I am extremely fortunate to have a loving parent. Bless her soul.My car is paid off and I hardly drive now it now anyway - so these two main expenses seem to be optimised.Will be looking at house hacking when I achieve the income that allows it. Please let me know what other rogue expenses  that could pop up in the future, and I should be on the look out for.
3. I have created a super tight budget of $800 for personal expenses, which was achieved last month. I now meal prep and make freezer meals for the month, eliminating eating out completely. Entertainment activities are only one day a week, and must be free or very cheap.
4. I've sold everything I don't use for extra cash. (Apple watches, cameras, drones etc)
5. On the income side I'm allocating 80% of my time to re-building my Amazon Publishing business. The other 20% of my time I'll be looking for side hustles to diversify my income and not relying on one income source. What are your favourite proven side hustles? Any input will be appreciated.
6. I'm devouring all of the FI content I can get my hands on, namely:MMM blog; *ChooseFI* book+Podcast; *Financial Freedom* by Grant Sabatier book+podcast; Quit like a Millionaire by Kristy Shen; *Work Optional* by Tanja Jester; *I Will Teach You To Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi; *Your Money or Your Life* by Vicki Robins; *The Simple Path to Wealth* by JL Collins; Mad Fientist blog+ podcast; Our Rich Journey Youtube channel and the Financial Mentor podcast. If there are any other recommendations it will be greatly appreciated.
7. As soon as my income covers my business and personal expenses I'll be investing in broad based, low-cost index funds. Any other suggestions for starting out? Recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

Any comments on blindspots you can see I have, the actions you think I should be taking, and where I should be focusing my time will be most welcomed and appreciated!I'm wanting to implement all of the the building blocks of FI to make this life possible.

Thanks for reading and hope you have a groovy day :)

153,"1MM -- 8 years on r/FI -- Career, Mistakes, Leanings, & Path Forward",,18,kdu1x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kdu1x4/1mm_8_years_on_rfi_career_mistakes_leanings_path/,1608064988.0,"8 years ago I stumbled across FIRE and was hooked immediately. I’ve been drawing knowledge and inspiration from [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) ever since -- last Friday, I surpassed the coveted 1MM of invested assets milestone.

Early on I promised to give back to the community upon reaching this threshold, and so I’m sharing my story, mistakes, and key learnings here in the hopes it will be of some value to you all.

**Career:**

Parlayed a love of math and budding interest in business into a career in consulting. While it’s not for everyone, consulting was pivotal in that it (a) gave me a strong foundation in problem solving, business, and communication, and (b) dually kept expenses down + income high. I’ve recently moved over into a data science role in pursuit of better work life balance and a desire to grow in a more technical direction. Happy to answer questions on these careers below as I don’t see them too much in [r/FI](https://www.reddit.com/r/FI/).

**The Numbers:**

&#x200B;

|Year|Salary|Net Worth|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|N/A|$30k|
|1|$100k|$90k|
|2|$105k|$180k|
|3|$135k|$275k|
|4|$145k|$385k|
|5|$210k|$520k|
|6|$300k|$750k|
|7|$330k|$1,000k (now!)|

&#x200B;

* Holdings: 100% S&P or substantially similar. CAGR has been \~10%.
* Expenses: I keep expenses between $25-35K yearly, achieved through budgeting and aided by the perks of consulting. Typically rent has been half of this in HCOL areas (lived with roommates and now long-term girlfriend), with the other half on food / entertainment / travel.

**Mistakes:**

* **Speculative Trading** \-- College: Estimated Current Value: $15K -- In college I got excited about investing and wanted to hit it big quick. I got into speculative oil companies (for the morbidly curious, ticker: HDYNQ). For that I paid the price of a couple summer’s worth of earnings, today worth considerably more. Thankfully [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) didn’t exist at the time.
* **Sitting on the Sidelines** \-- First 2 Years: Estimated Current Value: $40K -- I had learned my lessons on speculative trading, but certainly not on market timing. I was convinced the broader market was overvalued in my first couple of years investing -- but during those 2 years the market went up 20%! Eventually it was time to bite the bullet and get back in, tail between legs.

**Learnings:**

* **Illusion of control** \-- In many ways I consider myself lucky for having made those mistakes on the younger side of my career. I was already overconfident enough to believe I could beat or time the market; had I actually done so it would have only reaffirmed that belief, likely to the tune of much tougher-to-swallow later mistakes. Keeping an open mind and avoiding the fall for the [illusion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control) is a key tenet of how I invest now.
* **Keeping it simple --** The principles of FIRE are remarkably straightforward. I’m disciplined about first putting money in tax advantaged accounts, automatically investing what’s leftover in brokerage, and keeping a loose yearly budget which I track against monthly. I only invest in the S&P. If I’m talking to someone looking for investing advice I position FIRE as accessible as possible -- even a 20% savings rate gets you to FI before 60. For those with further interest, there's additional juice to squeeze from tax loss harvesting, backdoor Roth, and portfolio strategy.
* **FIRE is a tool, not an answer --** For me, FIRE was originally about having a plan and not having to work. About getting handed keys to my life. Along the way I’ve recognized that it’s just as important to “invest” in relationships, health, interests, and community. I try to pass this on to out of college hires by encouraging them to find fulfillment outside of work first; the sooner you can find balance on those dimensions the better.

**What’s next?**

By most measures I’m “financially independent” with a current spend in line with a 3% withdrawal rate. I enjoy what I learn and how I contribute through my job. I’d like kids. For now, I’ll raise my budget by half of whatever is over the 3% SWR and put the other half to work for anticipated future expenses.

As the financial picture looks more and more comfortable, I’ll consider moving part-time, or potentially move to another path entirely where I have interest (education technology, starting a business, teaching). I could also spend more time with family or some lifelong interests (always wanted to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail).",229,financialindependence
154,Taking a mini-retirement changed my FIRE plans permanently,,1804,kcik2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kcik2p/taking_a_miniretirement_changed_my_fire_plans/,1607892831.0,"2 years ago, I was in a demanding well paid job (Sales Engineering) where despite the perks, pay and status I found myself often day dreaming about retiring to a tropical island and checking on my FIRE spread sheets to see how close I am. After a lot of soul searching, I decided to quit. Went on a mini retirement for a few months and switch to a much easier job I knew I could coast in at a 40% paycut. This is a follow up to [the original post I made at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96jo5r/your_fire_obsession_may_be_a_symptom_of_stress/).

&#x200B;

That was hands down the best decision I have made for my quality of life. My outlook of life and future has changed rather dramatically since then but here is a brief list of things I did and lessons I learned:

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Mini-retirement and switch to lower stress role completely changed my outlook of work. I went from wanting to FIRE ASAP to wanting to go back to work and stay there. The change has persisted for 2 years now. I now no longer see myself ever fully retiring. I should be FI in about 6 years but I don't see it changing much in my life.

&#x200B;

**Events**:

* Setting up 3 month mini retirement: After I quit my job and landed the new role, I realized I hadn't had more than a week off in my entire adult life. I decided it was foolish to plan the rest of my life to work for retirement but never even sample it. And man am I glad I did. I negotiated a delayed start date with my new manager. He had worked with me before and wanted me badly on the team so he agreed.
* First month off: During the first month off I did exactly the type of thing you'd expect someone released from the bondage of work to do. I flew across the country. Drove down the west cost all the way from Canada to San Diego and back, camped in national parks all the way through. Visited family and friends all over the country.
* Emulated retired living for 2 months: The next two months I intentionally tried not to treat my time off as a big vacation and use this time to learn how life would be after retirement. At first many of my days became really unproductive and overshadowed by a feeling of uselessness and slow decay. I usually have no trouble with motivation but I found myself struggling to do much more than play games all day in my PJs. This is when I learned that I have very different mindsets for when I want to get shit done and relax. In order to put myself in the right mindset I started to structure my days a little more. Wake up at a certain time and get a morning routine: shower, coffee, walk. Work on a few personal projects for a few hours to feel a sense of accomplishment. One thing that I started to miss a lot was the social contact at work. Seeing my friends frequently quickly became a very important part of my life during this time.
* New role (QA Engineer): My new role turned out to be exactly as relaxing as I had remembered. There is this implied social narrative that all jobs are equally challenging especially if they pay similarly. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one will openly admit they have an easy job. On top of the fact that very few people have had more than 1 serious career and thus have no accurate way of comparing to other positions. This is my third (did software development as well) and I can confirm that the level of overall stress and cost/benefit ratio between roles even in the same company can be drastically different.

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned**:

* FIRE (specifically RE) fantasies were nothing more than sophisticated tools of escapism. Once I eliminated the main sources of stress from my job, I automatically stopped living in the future. It is an unhealthy way of not living in the present and living life to the fullest.
* Work provides a lot more than money for most people. Much more than people give it credit for and most of it unappreciated. It's also a major source of structure, socialization, challenges, recognition, sense of accomplishment, identity and sense of purpose. In it's absence, you have to recreate a lot of these things on your own except often not as successfully and without the money or motivation.
* Socialization outside of work is really difficult. If you already have a well established social circle and do not plan to move, you might be fine. But if you are planning on meeting people, it will become exceedingly difficult to form strong bonds. Strong bonds often require suffering shared negative experiences together. School and work have a natural way of doing just that. Recreating that when the baser needs are satisfied is much harder than it seems.
* Never settling for a stressful position. The only regret I have is me trying to hang on to positions that were actively hurting my health and not appreciating the amazing life experiences that were passing me by. The money I traded those experiences and my limited time on earth for, has already lost much of its significance.

&#x200B;

By the end of the 3 months I was aching to get back to my work routine. HR messed up my start date in the new position by pushing it forward a week and I was disappointed enough in it that I asked the manager to get it fixed so I can start when I wanted.",357,financialindependence

In April I started working on a net worth tracker for myself. Somewhere along the way it morphed into a sheet for friends, family, and anyone looking to get a hold of their finances. The goal of the sheet is provide you certainty about your financial situation in a time of uncertainty.

Advantages of the sheet over other net worth trackers:

* 100% Free
* No APIs that constantly break. Other trackers that have APIs have to constantly update them and experience periods where the connection is broken.
* Your data is yours. We have no access to your data when you make a copy.
* The sheet is setup to last for many years with minimal to no updates
* Full user guide to make the sheet easy to learn and use

Highlights of the sheet:

* Motivating goal tracking
* Customizable dashboard
* High level of detail if you want it, high level overviews if you don't
* Ability to track self employed users
* Ability to track individuals and couples
* Wedding expense tracker if you need it

In addition to the sheet, I created a full user guide to allow you to jump in and start taking control of your finances.

Edit: added the word ""and"" between the sheet and user guide

Edit 2: Updated the link to Version 1.1. On the Instructions tab I included all changes made due to the help of this community. 

For users with the old version, updating to the new version is as simple as copying and pasting beige cells from the 1.0 version to the 1.1 version. You can copy groups of cells at one time. Just be careful not to copy white cells with the beige.  If you copy and paste columns G and H on the Bank Activity tab, the dropdowns will not appear but the sheet will still calculate correctly.

RECAP

[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ey9jcl/art_to_tech_fire_in_12_years/)

My partner and I are in our mid-30's with 1 kid. We hit our FIRE number but decided to keep working (thank god). I am a creative in tech and partner is in entertainment.

[Here's our updated savings chart](http://imgur.com/a/U8PHeQc)

___________

When the pandemic started, we lost $300k in a few weeks. We felt surprisingly OK about losing 25% of our life savings. Figuring out childcare, not seeing our loved ones, and the uncertain future was way more stressful.

After a month of juggling WFH and childcare, we moved in with my parents. We got a few hours of help a day but I still didn't have time to do much besides chores and work. Luckily, my work allows part time and my request was recently approved! My salary was cut in half to $123k pre-tax/year but I still get benefits like health insurance and 401k. 

My partner on the other hand is putting in a ton of overtime. They are planning to quit next year, maybe do the same thing working for themselves. They said they wanted a few weeks off for videogames first lol.

I've continued to work steadily on art projects including gifts for close friends and family. It feels extra special to give them something custom they will treasure and remember. I also earned a few thousand $ but splurged on a camera, art supplies, and remote art classes. Breaking even on a hobby isn't bad!

Most of my friends from art school have moved on and only a few are professionally successful. I'm proud of them, they worked their asses off to get their dream career. I couldn't do the same. For me, doing art for fun is more fulfilling than doing it as a job.

Like many other people, we spent way less this year. We hit a savings rate of over 85%! Child care ($2.5k → 0 per month) and rent ($2.6k → $1.1k per month) were the biggest savers. Kid expenses were very low, around $60/month since we mostly get used and free stuff from Facebook.

We were able to donate more including to a friend who lost her job. We shoveled extra $ into index funds and dropped bank savings to 2 months of expenses.

Staying with parents is a mixed bag. I appreciate their help and enjoy the family time. They do treat us like teens sometimes and struggle with boundaries, especially with parenting. Once the pandemic lifts we will move out but still visit often and everyone will be happier.

I'm trying to help parents with finances. Mom moved her entire 401k into the money market when it tanked and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars following a friend's stock tips. Dad does daily trades on his 401k and brokerage account. They do save a lot but their investments are Wall Street Bets level of nuts. So frustrating, but not my money, not my retirement.

What's next? I want to keep my part-time job if they allow remote work. I have amazing insurance and the extra money helps reduce sequence of returns risk. We hope to travel often when it's safe to do so. It's my goal to donate even more, aiming to get my company's matching first and then open a donor advised fund.

___________

SUMMARY

 Total $1.67 million in assets: $8k in bank, $250k in company stocks, the rest in index stocks split 80% US + 20% international. The individual stocks are from a liquidity event at a startup and vested RSUs. We're holding for LTCG tax rates. 

 This year we earned $323k pretax and maxed out 401k's, HSA, backdoor roth IRAs, and a mega backdoor roth 401k. I earned about $213k of this.

 Our expenses were $30k, the lowest it's been since college years. It's good to know we can fall back to this level of spending as a safety measure.

 Next year we'll earn ~$153k pre-tax due to me working part-time and my husband quitting. After maxing out tax advantaged accounts, we'll pay under $12k in federal taxes. Compared to ~$70k+ this year, it's crazy low.

___________

This year I learned it's ok to lighten up, be flexible, and change goals. No one could have anticipated 2020 and we tried to make the best of it. We're privileged to be in our position. I'm trying to be grateful, give back, and spend time with loved ones and doing things I love including lots of art!


TLDR; Working less has panned out for our family. After a decade of pushing hard on the gas pedal, we're easing our way to retirement and the easy life.",12,financialindependence

164,"Traditional vs Roth Contributions, Why it's not Marginal Tax Rates",,149,kbgs6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kbgs6i/traditional_vs_roth_contributions_why_its_not/,1607739703.0,"I was going back and forth with a fellow FI member.  They made the claim that you shouldn't compare effective tax rates in retirement with marginal tax rates during accumulation but you should consider where to put the excess funds once you had enough Traditional IRA assets such that they filled the 12% tax bracket throughout retirement.  Any additional money withdrawn from the IRA would be taxed at the higher tax rate, 22% ,which would be the same during accumulation, if your marginal rate was 22%.  This is something that I struggle with and I decided to run a few scenarios, listed below, to see how this actually pans out.  I made this post so that the community can peer review my assumptions and work and see if it make sense.

*Assumptions:*

Traditional contributions and withdraws operate on a FILO principle such that contributions during accumulation are the first dollars removed from taxable income, and withdraws in retirement are the last added to your income.  Married filing jointly, take standard deduction, earn 150k/yr during accumulation and want to live a 150k/yr lifestyle in retirement.  100% Social Security taxable, in reality, most likely 85%.

*During Accumulation*

20K Traditional Contribution saves 22% in taxes = 4,400 in taxes.  Taxable income 150K - 20K - 25K = 105K.  Fed Taxes: 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 25K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 5.5K = 14.7K / 150K = 9.8% effective tax rate.

**Scenario 1: Pension and Social Security Fill 12% Tax Bracket**

SS = 30K, Pension = 50K, Trad Withdraw 150K - 50K - 30K = 70K.  Effective tax rate on the Traditional IRA money: 70K - 25K (Standard Deduction) = 45K, 45K X 22% = 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 70K Trad Withdraw = *14.1% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 2: No Pension, SS = 30K**

Trad Withdraw = 150K - 30K = 120K.  Effective tax rate on the Trad: 120K - 25K (SD) = 95K, 50K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 6K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 120K Trad Withdraw = *13.3% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 3:  No Pension or SS**

Trad Withdraw 150K, Effective tax rate on the Trad: 150K - 25K (SD) = 125K, 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 150K Trad Withdraw = *12.7% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit).

**Conclusion:**

It seems that the phrase, ""if your income is the same in retirement as it is today then it doesn't matter or Roth is better"" seems incorrect.  Even with the same 150K income/150K retirement lifestyle, the effective rate of your Traditional IRA withdraws is less than the rate at which deposits entered pre-tax vehicles.  I was surprised to see Scenario 1 was actually pretty favorable towards pre-tax.  Mainly because the standard deduction applies to the first (top) dollars of income, so basically Traditional IRA withdraws = the Standard Deduction are Tax Free.  This means that you need to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement in order for the effective tax rate on Traditional IRA money to equal your current marginal tax rate.  How much higher?  That's probably another post.  I tried to make sure I didn't make any math errors.  Let me know if it looks logical and sound.  Thanks for taking the time to read and good luck on your journey!

Edit:  Someone mentioned what about Roth and I believe you could just reverse the thinking.  Instead of saving 22% during accumulation and paying 14.1, 13.3, or 12.7% in retirement, flip it.  You spent 22% during accumulation and saved 14.1, 13.3 or 12.7% in retirement.",183,financialindependence

166,going uninsured as an option,,133,kbdi75,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kbdi75/going_uninsured_as_an_option/,1607727820.0,"Sorry in advance for the length.

A friend and I are both looking to pull the trigger sometime in the next year.  I spent some time earlier today talking friend and discovered they is planning to self-insure (go without insurance, year by year), and at first I argued against it but ... I'm starting to wonder and would like some opinions.

For friend and family, they expected outlay based on their last two years of great insurance and a moderate ($4000) deductible looked like this: 

	insurance paid: $6000
	they directly paid out of pocket (paycheck and deductible): $8000
	employer paid (employer-side costs): $40000

so for $48000 they received $8000 in benefits.  Equivalent insurance is looking to be roughly the same (unsurprising) plus or minus plans with serious downsides on the lower end (plans with 10%-20% co-insurance).  

Health insurance basically buys you two things - one is it removes your direct involvement in price negotiation (vs. being a cash payer) and second it mitigates very large downside risk.

As an example, the all-cash, negotiation-challenged bill one would expect after the full course of treatment for a heart attack or hemmoraghic stroke could be as much as $350,000 to $400,000 but averages significantly lower (we live in a state that has banned balance billing).  Cancer treatment for a metastatic brain tumor is roughly in that ball park (again, typically much lower -- 70k, $100k) and so on. One of the worst things that could happen that isn't a very low probability is something like finding out you have an AVM, where it is both urgent and the expert surgeons and stereotactic surgery could run over $1M.  

From a probability standpoint, for a man in his fifties, the real risks for his next ten years look like this:

	1.a. injured by some driver in a car accident - carry uninsured/underinsured on your policy to cover it (this is cheap: $50 a month or less for most people)
	1.b. at fault in an accident that injures you (the car insurance does not cover this)
	2. injury somewhere not at home - sue for medical expenses (this could be expensive and you likely will not recover the whole sum but it does mitigate the issue)
	3. Injured at home - oops, this is bad (no idea how to mitigate this)
	4. Heart attack
	5. Cancer
	6. Stroke
	7. Diagnosis with a severe chronic disease like Parkinsons (unlikely) or MS (somewhat more likely)

The actual frequency of #4+ and beyond is low enough that in a given 10Y timeframe, you would really not expect even one event.  Let's be very conservative - assume a 50:50 chance that the worst case scenario happens.  That's a probability of 0.5.

During that time you would pay out around $48000 (declining after a few years when the kids roll off the plan, but offset by the fact that insurance costs have been rising well above inflation) a year, or somewhere around $480k over the course of 10Y (with a probability of 1.0).

	no insurance case: 0.5 * 400,000	= expected outlay of $200,000
	insurance case: 1.0 * 480,000 		= expected outlay of $480,000

For starters, this person is in the position that a sincle outlay of $200k-$400k would _hurt_ but wouldn't be the end of the world or the end of their retirement.

There are also some mitigating factors for the no insurance case, the biggest one being that you're actually only footing part of the costs because the event occurs either during open enrollment (in which case, you buy insurance) where, while you still end up on the hook for the pre-enrollment period, you eliminate the fat tail costs.  Pretty much all of the calendar year, the distance from some day of the year to open enrollment is steadily decreasing and only the spring and summer are actual hazards of not seeing some amount of the event's tail costs covered.

There are all sorts of obvious issues with this:

1. if ACA goes away, the pre-existing conditions problems pre-ACA would be back in force, and the lack of existing coverage to mitigate that would be a serious downside risk vs. just carrying coverage

2. there is actually no mitigation of downside risks at all - especially if both he and his spouse roll natural 1's and get hit with a serious event in close succession; similarly, because they are uncorrelated, it's possible that one has, say, a hemmorhagic stroke followed by the discovery of cancer, and the odds of this increase over time due to age; a really bad sequence of events could wipe this person out

3. obviously, this doesn't work if the single event downside risk is outside your financial buffer

4. items (1.b) and (3) are not mitigated at all, and while both are hypothetically in your control, injuries at home are frequent and at-fault may come down to the details of an accident.

That said, I'd like to hear other arguments pro or anti.

171,"For people who (permanently) moved to a different country, when in your FIRE timeline did you make the move? Would you do anything differently?",,128,kao8k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kao8k2/for_people_who_permanently_moved_to_a_different/,1607634427.0,"For background, I'm currently 22 and going to graduate next year with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I currently live in the US, but I am a dual Canadian-US citizen and am planning to move back to Canada at some point in the future. The only thing that I really care about is being FI as soon as possible and I'm not planning to retire immediately because I do like engineering. I want to make sure I make the move at the right time, since I know salaries are much lower in Canada compared to the US. 

I want to move back since all of my family still lives in Canada, and I want to be closer to them as I get older. I would consider moving sooner, but from what I understand, it's very difficult to get an entry-level job in mechanical engineering (that isn't O&G) for outsiders, so I want to make the move when I'm slightly more established. 

So long story short, what I'm wondering is this: When is the best time to make the move? Should I wait until I have reached my FI goals in the US and then go? Is there a tool that I can use to calculate different scenarios including the US and Canada?

And lastly, for those of you who have done this, do you have any advice or even stories about what you did? I'd love to hear about it",60,financialindependence
172,Roth conversion at what tax rate?

As such, I'm beefing up my retirement plan to simulate Roth conversions of 401k/IRA.  I initially setup my model to convert to Roth whenever I had room in the 12% tax bracket.  However, this will not wind down my pre-tax retirement accounts before SS and Medicare and I will have to plan RMDs.  I will have a pension starting at 60 and I expect to have some inheritance income at some point as well, which complicates the planning a bit.  

So in summary, how do you plan Roth conversions?  Do you limit them based on your highest marginal tax bracket or do you try to get it completed before taking SS and Medicare to minimize tax/cost for these?

My wife (26)and I (28) are pretty good at saving: max out both 401ks, roth IRAs, and also HSA and we have a good amount saved up in cash (~6 months living expenses). Both of us have secure jobs so the amount of cash savings is realistically a bit overkill. 

We don't keep a ""strict"" budget but do keep an eye on spending and I have budgeted strictly in the past so I still have a really good idea of where our money is going. I now just mainly keep an eye on cash flow and make sure our checking account isn't dropping each month. We are overall mostly frugal and both agree that we want to (cautiously) enjoy some of our money now because the future isn't guaranteed and we ideally want to take 1-2 moderately nice vacations per year. 

We are in the process of trying to plan a trip right now and I'm struggling to come up with how much we can comfortably afford while allowing us to still take trips each year.  

Does anyone have a good method they use for calculating this number? X% of gross or net income? Something else? What has worked for you?

My fear is that we will book this trip and I will be a cheapwad once we get there because I will feel like we've already spent a lot on travel costs alone so I'll skimp on activities and nicer restaurants - aka the fun parts...  Or my other fear is that we will take this trip then not take another for 3 years. I'm hoping I can avoid these scenarios if I can think of a good way to calculate the slush fund before we go.

174,FIRE Financial progress – Year 1 Review,,151,kabup8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kabup8/fire_financial_progress_year_1_review/,1607589454.0,"Half-throwaway, will post next year again with this user. 

**General:** 

We (F30, M35), living in EU/Germany. Combined Yearly Income: around 95k€ pre-tax. Aiming for (part) FIRE in a super LCOL in EU which we have a house in. 300k€+ is the magic number we aim for. We don’t mind some working in FIRE, since doing nothing is (not yet) our thing. I am planning to change my working time and start a business within the next year, more on this in the “outlook 2021” below. 

Our SR over 2020 is around 40%. We don’t mind it fluctuating, but we have a minimal saving amount which automatically goes to investments at the beginning of every month.

**2020 Thoughts:** 

*2020 has been wild*, due to COVID I got to work at home a LOT and I love home office, but at reduced pay as a cost. Nevertheless, no daily car commute of 45 mins (x2) has buffered this at least partly and given me much more free time. Currently I am employed on full time/pay again. My SO has gone from jobless to work in her dream Job within a bumpy 6 Months, and since she got that full time Job, life is a lot easier for us. Overall, it was a great year financially. Due to COVID our spending on travel has really slashed and this helped getting those saving habits on track. 

**Outlook for 2021**: 

*Job* - I can’t take my current IT-Job anymore and I am increasingly frustrated because of this, no pay can make up for this. In the last 2 Years I drifted completely inside the IT field, from tech and engineering before, and I hate it. My employer is really great overall and very secure / reliable which is the main reason why I am still there, but outside of the IT department there is no Job for me in the company (again, due to COVID), so I am definitely at a dead end. The thing is, my pay is the main income for us and together with the security and reliability of my current job and COVID situation it’s really hard to find something new which checks all boxes. This is the reason why I am so inert on leaving it. 

*My next steps*, after a lot of thinking and calculating, I decided to switch to part time working for 2 years, starting 01.04.2021 next year. This means I will work only 60% of my current hours which equals to 3 days a week. Thanks to German work laws, my employer must allow me this change. But that is not all, I also decided to start my own small business in a huge hobby of mine, and use above mentioned 2 “part time” years to test if this is feasible and working. Cant really wait to get this started and I am really excited for this, so wish me luck! I calculated this through, and it shouldn’t have a major impact on our savings if I cut some unnecessary spending, we will see how it develops. 

My SO is very happy with her job so that is at least great, and she has much room to grow professionally which should also help us in the years to come.

**Portfolio 2020 breakdown:** 

*Net Worth, (no debt): 70k€* 

* ETF´s & Stocks: 24€ (Performance YoY: +15%) 

* Metals: 11k€ 

* Crypto: 11k€ 

* Cash/EF/Travel money: 8k€ 

* Lending: 16k€ 

*Portfolio 2020 thoughts*: Idea was to go ETF´s - USA focused, supplemented with Tech stocks. The whole year I bought ETF´s as base (MSCI World, S&P500) + some major Tech stocks. All in all, I was very satisfied with the outcome with a +15% gain. 

Metals: Investment from 2017/18, actually a good ""return"" since then, but it is seen as a stabilizing factor. And its nice to have the physical coins.

Crypto: the odd one, this are some old holdings from the 2017 bull run, which are “now” quite nice in value again, for doing nothing in this regard, it is very pleasant. 

**Portfolio 2021 goal & orientation:** 

*PF Goal: reach a PF net worth of 85k€+* 

*PF allocation target*: ETF´s/Stocks: 60-70%, Metals: 10%, Cash: 5-10% (max. 10k€), Crypto: ?let it run? 

Portfolio allocation plan 

*ETF & Stocks* 

* ETF MSCI World: 1/3rd of Monthly savings plans always goes into this, my PF core investment. 

* ETF Renewable Energy: 1/3rd of Monthly savings. This I expect to be the next big runner in the years to come. 
Stocks

* Furthermore, I will add to my individual AMD and Nvidia positions at least for 2021, any money I have spare 

*Metals* 

* no change and no investment planed. 

*Crypto* 

* fun money & speculation on another BTC bubble coming, I hold only BTC & ETH. I had my fair share of Shitcoins in the past and got out with “just” a blue eye. Small money is put in here again every month, hope for more future gains across 2021/22. 

*Cash/EF* 

* No Change, we are good here also. 

*Lending* 

* the payback of the 16k€ is planned for this year, so this will be invested when it arrives. Don’t know how it will be split among my positions yet, but definitely split between Stocks and ETF´s.


**Our Milestones Milestones reached in 2020**

* PF Value and CoastFIRE goal reached (Retirement in 25y+): PF value of 50k€ 

*Next Milestones* 

* ETF&Stock Positions value of 50k€+ 
* PF value of 100K€ 

*Finally, Time till FIRE (at current SR): 8 years* 

Thanks for reading and until next year where I hope I can report many more positive developments.",77,financialindependence

176,How my wife saved me (financially as well as other tings),,1715,k9h5l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9h5l3/how_my_wife_saved_me_financially_as_well_as_other/,1607474699.0,"First let me say I am making this post in response to the amazing and overwhelming comments I received as a result of my comment on another post. You guys are all amazing. I waited until my wife was home and she's here with my as I type making sure I don't miss anything and also to fact check when I exaggerate as I have a tendency to do.

TL;DR: I was a middle-class suburban bum who didn't know anything about money and my wife came from nothing and her work ethic and ability to organize money led me to pay off my student loans last week

Now to get an idea of both myself and my wife I'll give you a little background. I came from a typical Middle Class, suburban American family. My mom is a nurse and my dad has done everything from own a chair factory to delivering dental supplies, but we always were pretty well off. This is also partly due to my father's family being very wealthy and allowing him to inherit the money to buy his home with zero mortgage. Financially, I was taught little or nothing growing up, everyone is aware of the lack of financial prep in the US school system, and my family treated money as a sort of ""dirty"" topic. If you did something for free you were ""clean"" and ""noble"" if you did things outright for the pay it was ""mercenary"" and not considered good. When I was told to look for careers both me and my siblings weren't told ""make sure you can make a living and take care of yourselves"" but ""do what you love, the money doesn't matter"" and the classic ""money doesn't bring happiness"". It took me years to learn that a lack of money can certainly bring UNhappiness.

So, as a result, I found myself making a series of financial mistakes my whole life. Everything from not opening a line of credit (I thought I was ""beating the dirty bankers"") to develop my credit score, to repeatedly overdrawing my checking account to be hit with $500 overage fees AND additional $25 late on paying the overage fees-fees (Once I owed up to $2000 without realizing and only by pleading with both the bank to reduce it to $1000 and my mom to pay it off did I escape that fiasco). And I never really learned. After moving out of the house I did get used to checking my checking account to make sure I had enough money to pay various bills and rent, though I do remember forgetting a few times and having my water shut off. Long story short I found myself an adult with no career, $80,000+ in student loan debt, and zero idea of how to progress.

Now my wife's story is about as opposite as you can get. She was born in Thailand. Her mother was from an extremely poor farming family who sometimes had one bowl of rice to share for the whole family for the day. Her dad was a little better off with a more middle class family and worked as an electrician of sorts. My wife's mother was his second marriage after he drove the first wife off and it was an arranged marriage that my wife's mother did not was to do. She has an older half sister from her father's first marriage (who is a mess) and her father did NOT want another girl, he wanted a boy. In fact her nickname to this day is ""Bee"" stemming from her being ""Plan B"" or ""If it's a boy, his name is A, if it's a girl she's B"".

That theme sort of continued while she was young. Her sister was given as much as the family could support, being the oldest, and had all the normal things like schools supplies and even had her university studies paid for by their father (she dropped out). My wife on the other hand had to make due with hand me down clothes that her mom would sew deep hems in the skirts to fit her body which she would eventually let out bit by bit as she grew. When she wanted to go to school her father told her she had to find the money herself because the family couldn't afford it.

Thankfully, her mom (basically to keep her occupied while her mom was at work) had signed her up for every athletics program under the sun from a very young age and thanks to both good academic grades and a talent for basketball she not only achieved scholarships to a college prep school but to one of the most prestigious universities in the country. She just told me to make sure that I mention how her mom had her keep a record of her spending and saving on a piece of paper ever since she got a small allowance as a little girl and learn how to cut out ""unnecessary things"" (her favorite mantra that I picked up).

While at University my wife had to struggle in the extreme as not only did her family not help with tuition, but food, housing, books, clothes, or anything else was up to her. She had to find a way to make enough money to live and study while competing both for the schools basketball and, occasionally, the schools Judo team, which any student athlete can tell you is already a full time job.

It was hard, very hard. ""The lowest point of my life"" she says. She made money by doing freelance work as a graphics designer (she majored in Animation and Graphic Design, she always wanted to learn to paint but decided she'd never make money doing that, to this day she's an amazing sketch artist and painter btw). She went for years subsiding on about $40 a month. She couldn't even afford rice to eat and had to buy bulk packs of ramen noodles which she supplemented with discount vegetables to literally not get scurvy. This whole time she watched as her family descended into chaos as her grandfather (on her dad's side) passed away and his children, her aunts and uncles fought like hyenas over an elephants carcass over the inheritance and her sister ended up stealing from her father large sums of money, ran off, got pregnant, abandoned her children and came back to continue a sad decline into drugs and bad life choices.

She graduated eventually and tried to make a living as a graphic artist in Thailand, but her dad had lost his job due to a declining mental state caused by PTSD from several brushes with Thailand's underworld while he was an electrical building inspector. So now, she had to support her father (and as a result her sister) on her own. After two years of trying in Thailand she realized she wouldn't be able to and ended up decided to leave Thailand and become and au pair to support her family. I'd like to add that through my wife I've met a lot of au pairs and their lot is utter garbage and little better than slavery in many situations and while many come from decent backgrounds just trying to make some money while they explore the wider world, most are desperate and trying to find a way to escape the poverty of their homes like my wife.

I met my wife in America. I was working as a fat, more than broke delivery driver and she was a struggling au pair working basically 24/7 (I know it's technically not, but when you live in the home you work it does it really matter if you're on the clock if the baby wakes up crying?) and making $195 a week. She sent back $350 a month to support her family and saved the rest as best she could. I had no idea how much I made or where it went aside from I hadn't had an overcharge fee in a little while.

Eventually after meeting, falling in love, and deciding to get married she eventually quit being an au pair and moved in with my and my family (after I moved back to America I moved in with my parents where I still live today) and the journey of first discovering my financial mess and fixing it began, and oh boy, what I write can only scratch the edge of the weekly ""checkups"" and arguments and lectures and stress that went into this development, it wasn't easy for either of us. She couldn't believe she'd become partners with such a disorganized mess and for me it proved to be VERY hard to learn to curb your spending when you never thought to before.

Luckily, I had ""graduated"" from being a delivery driver to working at Solar City. The first step on a long journey that eventually led to me joining the Ironworkers Union. On my development my wife showed me how to keep a physical record of every single penny I spent and earned. I would keep it up for a week, forget and loose the book then she would buy me another one and we began again. I have a closet full of about a dozen checking account books. Then she had me organize my student loans. I had no idea how much my monthly minimums were and was shocked to find out it was almost $700/mo. She taught me what interest was. These were the first steps.

I struggled, I mean really struggled to get the basic concepts of knowing where my money was at all times. Old me thought that was a waste of brain energy and it was a hard mentality to break. I'd say at least a year went by before I really understood how much I made each week/month and what my monthly expenditures were and by then I'd taken my second step in my career as a laborer working for a commercial solar company. Now I was making enough money to start paying off my loans consistently on my own (my mom had been paying part each month) even with my sloppy book keeping. This was the second biggest motivator in my life to get my sh\*t together, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that, yes I in fact could climb out of my hole myself. This and the other motivation led me to working as much overtime as possible and picking up a second job as a pizza delivery guy Friday-Sunday. I was not working more than I thought was possible (depending on overtime opportunities between 65-85 hours a week).

The main motivation though, was seeing my wife's growth no matter how many hours I worked she always ALWAYS worked more it was inspiring, exhaustin and terrifying at times to see. In my previous comment I said she'd nearly doubled her income a year, and I wasn't joking. After she left being an au pair she had to wait 6 grueling months to get her green card. It nearly drove her insane and she ended up working under the table as a cleaning lady to continue to support her family. She'd clean everything from ritsy homes in Cambdrige and Brookline to the utterly disgusting college kid housing around BC/BU/Harvard areas. She kept a paper record this whole time and is checking it now to see how much she made she made a little over $1000/month.

After she was cleared for work she continued as a cleaning lady but also got a job as a cashier, eventually a waitress at a local Vietnamese restaurant. She stopped being an au pair in January, in June she was making $1000/mo, July $1800, August $2100, September $2700, October $3000. She just read those off (I'm rounding to the nearest $100). A year later she'd left the cleaning job and started working as a waitress at a second restaurant as well as picking up shifts at David's Bridal as a seamstress, eventually maxing out at $4500/mo. In March 2018 she made $5200. This is just from pure willpower and work ethic. After going over the numbers this is where she maxes out for the present but even if it's not doubled (sorry my own exaggeration) since then this, to me, is an outstanding growth.

So watching her fight like that how could I not? I worked my bun off right next to her. She taught me to push like I never pushed before and now that I was putting in that many hours and that much effort I finally not only had the knowledge how to track my money but I had a deep desire to know where every drop of sweat was being saved or spent. I got better at accounting using Mint and my bank's online manager. I followed my 401k growth, I checked how much I was spending on gas, on work clothes, I didn't write it down like she did but I learned to keep track of everything. Nothing motivates someone knowing how much they have like knowing how hard it is to earn.

Eventually I got into the Union after years in construction. With my wife's work ethic driving my I'd garnered a reputation as a motivated and dedicated hand wherever I went. I might not be the best, but you can bet I'd be the first there and the last to leave, very few people out worked me. This reputation eventually got me noticed by a Union member and thanks to years of trying to keep up with my wife I'd grown into a much better person and while it can be very difficult to get into a Union it took one week from my first meeting to being on a jobsite with a Union outfit, riding an elevator up the biggest building I'd ever worked on (50ish stories) and up to a career that could support my own family the rest of my life. All thanks to my wife. After that I'd graduated the whole ""watch your money"" phase she taught me more, and we learned together. I started paying off my loans early in a focused way, starting with the highest interest first. I opened credit cards and used them both sparingly and paid them off each week to keep my balance low and my credit score high. I started investing in basic stocks to get a feel for the market, putting about 10% of my paycheck in as a learning cost and two years after getting into the ironworkers union I FINALLY paid off the last of my student debt. From $80,000+ to $0 all thanks to my wife's guidance and teachings.

Sorry this is an aside but it's actually funny, compared to any American construction worker I was a hungry tiger who devoured work, and it actually meant I ended up being classified less as ""one of the Americans"" but was adopted by the other class of hungry-tiger-worker in my industry: the other immigrants. Construction in any state in the US is done by Spanish immigrants, not completely but they are a constant and huge presence on any jobsite. Most I've met work like my wife. Voraciously. They came from harder lives than most can understand (An Elsalvadorian friend of mine, and the best carpenter I've ever seen, tell me how when he was 12 a guerrila army told him he was to fight with them or they'd kill his mom so he did that until a helicopter gunship killed them all so he ran and got a job loading boulders onto trucks). My motto since then has been ""Work like an immigrant, get paid like a citizen"". That last part is unfortunately since many are illegal they get taken hugely advantage of with no options.

To finish this insanely long tale: After I got in the Union my wife saw how the Union allowed minorities and women a chance to work in the trades and the benefits both in take home pay, and in benefits (Insurance, annuity, pension, vacation pay, free training) and decided she wanted to make the move, too. Ever since she was little she wanted to be like her dad, an electrician, but he told her girls couldn't do it. Now, when the opportunity presented itself she gave it her all, like she always does, and less than a year later she is the top student in her 1st year technician apprentice class and had multiple supers and foremen tell her she'll be a foreman soon, which I never doubted.

179,Math of healthcare subsidy versus maxing out the 0% bracket for tax-gain harvesting?,,183,k9akc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9akc4/math_of_healthcare_subsidy_versus_maxing_out_the/,1607454337.0,"So, I recently pulled the trigger and am at least going to be taking an extended sabbatical, and am currently in the process of signing up for health insurance for 2021.  I'm starting to do some math to figure out whether it's worthwhile to set income at the ~60k level to get some subsidies, or fill up all the way to ~80k in order to tax-gain harvest the last 20k.  

I'm in MA so some ACA things are a little more complex for me, and nobody can give me a straight answer but apparently if my income stays under ~$61k I think I get a health plan that costs $150/mo directly through the state?  I'm 36 and my wife is 47 if it matters.

We expect to spend ~50k/year before health insurance premiums, and the first set of investments that will be sold for rebalancing purposes have a cost basis of ~$0, so 100% of it will be capital gains.  There's multiple years of those $0 basis gains to go through.

I'm curious if anybody else has had similar situations and made a decision one way or the other?  I'm leaning towards filling up the tax bracket and maxing out gain harvesting in lieu of the subsidies, just because I have so many gains.

But what pushed me do it was seeing yet another casually sexist comment on /r/personalfinance about girlfriends taking your money. I’m tired of generalizations (especially in places where the demographics skew male, like finance subreddits) about women being obstacles to a man’s FI journey at best, or high-maintenance gold-diggers at worst. So I feel obligated to be a visible example of a FI-minded woman, and to add another female voice to the FI conversation.

**TL,DR:**

* Super fortunate in many ways. Graduated debt-free from a top school
* Investment banking → tech (but non-engineer)
* \>60% savings rate in a VVHCOL city - live comfortably but intentional about spending
* 5 years after graduation: $750K net worth (\~$300K in post-tax Roth retirement accounts), and total annual comp of \~$275K (excl equity)
* Net worth growth came both from increasing income (switching companies, getting promoted) and from healthy investment returns throughout

[Summary table of income and net worth over time](https://imgur.com/a/FzeTRlZ)

*Note that the years aren’t totally representative of my actual annual incomes because job transitions and promotions have tended to happen in the middle of year.*

***My story***

* **I was super lucky, in a lot of ways**. I had a middle-class upbringing but my immigrant parents both worked full-time and taught me the value of education and of saving money early on. We always spent below our means.
* **My upbringing and debt-free education = single biggest driver of my financial success thus far.** My parents also paid for my college education so I graduated debt-free from a top university (one of Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford). I amassed a small starting stash of \~$20K by graduation from working paid internships during every college summer (and investing my savings).
* **I started my career in investment banking, then transitioned into corporate strategy at tech companies**. Initially I took a pay cut in leaving finance, but have since grown my income comfortably - and it was worth it solely for the higher quality of life (i.e. not working 80 hours/week in a soul-crushing grind, surrounded by very rich yet deeply unhappy people, adding little discernible value to society).
* **I currently live very comfortably in a VHCOL city**. I eat well, take plenty of vacations, rent a nice apartment, buy myself small luxuries, etc. - but am intentional about spending my money where I feel it most improves my wellbeing.
* **My savings rate is currently >60%**, which includes maxing out retirement contributions. I acknowledge this is also only possible because I’m young and don’t have any dependents yet (my boyfriend is a software engineer and does fine, though I’m proud my income/NW are higher than his) - if I have kids in this city in the near future, my expenses will definitely skyrocket.

***On investing***

* Investing has been a major driver of my net worth growth: **\~$275K of the $750K NW is from investment gains made over the last 5 years.**
* I’ve invested all of my extra money (excluding 6 months emergency savings / small amount in checking) since I was in high school.
* Passive investing is objectively the best approach for the vast majority of people. About ⅔ of my net worth is passively invested in diversified low-fee index funds / ETFs.
* However, I enjoy active investing and doing the research, so **about ⅓ of my NW is invested in individual stocks**. My actively invested portfolio has made substantial returns over the last 5 years thanks to several investments that have doubled, tripled, up to 9x’d - like NVDA, NVCR, SQ, TWLO, CRM, etc. Given that I’m young and have a very long investing horizon, I’m okay with having a somewhat higher level of risk in my portfolio from these individual stocks.
* **I also basically never sell my investments** \- have never tried to time the market, never sold because I thought it was about to crash, etc. It’s worked out pretty well for me, with my 5Y annualized return beating all market indices in the same time period - time will tell if that’ll continue to be true.

***Reflecting / looking ahead***

* My target milestone is to hit **$1M net worth by 30**, which looks quite feasible at my current income and assuming my portfolio/the market doesn’t tank in the next 2 years.
* Getting to the first $100K really is the hardest - it just keeps snowballing from there, and your NW increases faster and faster... I only made a post about hitting $500K \~4 months ago! 
* **I don’t count illiquid equity in any of my projections**. Even though it might turn into a big payday if my current company goes public, for now, I treat it as imaginary money. (If it does become liquid, then my path to FI will accelerate substantially, given I have high six figures in nominal equity value, both vested/unvested.)
* **$2.5M is my fat-FI number**, but I’ll probably keep working after I hit that. But who knows - if I get married / start a family / have kids, maybe my priorities will change.
* Leaving finance for tech was a big leap for me, in part because staying in finance was the path of least resistance / most prestige / highest comp. I could have left my top-tier investment banking job for a role in private equity / hedge funds / venture capital instead, and been making $300K+ comp as a 24-year-old (as many of my banking peers did). Taking a pay cut to go to a startup felt risky and uncomfortable at the time -- but I have no regrets, looking back. Leaving finance made me happier, healthier, and a better and more interesting person; even if it also meant a slightly longer path to hit NW milestones, I’m still doing just fine. The tradeoffs were more than worth it.

181,[UPDATE] $500k the boring way,,1520,k8it0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8it0c/update_500k_the_boring_way/,1607355448.0,"This is an update of my previous post, [“$250k the boring way”](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/) and my original post, [""$100k the boring way""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/). I’ll recap as best I can but all the details are in those if you're interested.

**Summary**

Reached $500k (now $600k, sorry I'm lazy) net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 8 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Quick Recap** **^(that keeps getting longer am I getting old)**

My wife and I are both 32 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I’m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $250k net worth we:

* Both got graduate degrees.
* Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
* Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $116k for me and $54k to $80k for my wife.
* Had a baby and wife took some unpaid time.
* Bought a house

**Updates**

Second half of 2019: Nothing really happened financially but we did take a family vacay to NZ and Fiji for 2 weeks. Somehow made it work taking a 1.5 year old halfway across the world and can't say enough about how much I would recommend both places. Can't say it was always relaxing but I would do it again. Also found out we were going to be having another baby.

In the last update my job had just added on-call pay. I ended up with about $5k of this bringing me to $121k total compensation.

2020: Our son was born in early March right as the pandemic was lifting off. I still haven't decided if this was a great time to have a baby or a horrible time. Financially, our timing was (purposely) a lot better with the school schedule and combined with a new maternity leave policy at my wife's job, she didn't have to take any unpaid leave this time around.

At my job, I got another 5% merit raise plus COLA increase bringing me to my current base salary of $126k. Looks like I'm on track for another $5k of on-call pay on top of that. My company went all remote so I haven't been back to the office since the day my wife went into labor. I'm liking the work from home situation a lot and expect that I will be WFH at least 2 days a week once the office is open again.

We refinanced our house in the spring from a 30yr 4.5% down to a 20yr 3.25% loan which increased our monthly payment but saves us an estimated $120k over the life of the loan, so that's nice. I'm actually working on another refi right now to get down to 20yr 2.875% to save an additional $30k. I imagine I'll call it good here but hey you never know.

This fall when school resumed, we made the decision to drop my wife down to part-time. This has been our plan from the beginning: work 5 years to qualify for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program and then go to just 3 days a week in order to have more time for family but still accrue full years towards the pension.

On that note, we applied for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program in June as soon as my wife's 5th year had ended. Our application was rejected by our servicer Nelnet 3 times before being sent on to the Dept. of Education in September. It was a very slow and frustrating process but ultimately was worth the hard work, as we found out just last week that it was approved and $17.5k was instantly removed from our balance. I got a lot of questions on this program last time - all the details can be found [here](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher). We have just $10k of loans left now that we will let sit there until they start accruing interest again or are forgiven by the new administration.

**Chart**

[Here is our financial journey summed up in one line](https://imgur.com/VDa8UcH). It's definitely starting to look like more of a curve now. The inflection points that used to stand out just kind of look like noise now, so here are the relevant dates in list form:

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
3. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
4. 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
5. 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.
6. 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.
7. 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.
8. 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.

**Current Finances**

* $90k e-fund, $5k in an HSA.
* $326k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* $189k equity in our home
* \-$10k of student loans remaining
* Current savings rate is down to 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies.
* Monthly expenses have gone up quite a bit, looking like our budget is about $7k which seems crazy to me. Luckily daycare isn't forever I guess.

**Thoughts**

Salary

I mentioned in my last update that I was closing in on the salary cap in my current position. At the end of this upcoming January I will get like a 1% raise and be maxed in my band. Unfortunately to go higher means I would likely need to take on a supervisory role, and I'm not sure yet if that's something I want. I've been doing all the required trainings for that just in case but I really like the position I'm in now so no rush I think.

Now What

Student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. For 8 years now they have weighed on me, sometimes heavily (and that's even with knowing that our career choices meant we would be okay and get them paid off eventually). The loan forgiveness was something we carefully planned for. It's definitely a weird feeling to be essentially student debt-free after pouring so much time, money and energy into dealing with them. Luckily I can fill this void with a very long to-do list.

Near term, I need to put a priority on making a will for us and making sure all of the stuff related to that is in order. Along those same lines I'd like to get some extra life insurance going besides just the basic coverage we get from work automatically. Still haven't put a lot of thought into our strategy for saving for college. We are likely buying a minivan (please give me all your minivan tips and recommendations) in the next couple months. Longer term, we have started talking about what a home upgrade might look like for us.

**The End**

My third update (at least to me) seems even more boring than ever. Having a new baby and navigating the pandemic at the same time meant that in the past 9 months I really haven't had much time or energy to think about saving, spending, or retirement so it all just sort of happened on its own. Before preparing to make this update I hadn't logged in to categorize our transactions since June which is crazy for me. I basically stopped coming to this sub vs being a daily reader. I'm most definitely in ""the boring middle"" now.

In the last update I had said ""The financial peace of mind is extremely valuable to us as we navigate the wonderful and scary world of parenting"". Well since then, we doubled down on the parenting and added a global pandemic on top. We are extremely fortunate to still have our jobs and our health, and I don't take that for granted. To not really ""worry"" about money during this time is a luxury to be sure, but one that we worked hard for. 

Thanks for reading, everyone. Back to saving now. See you at the $1M update!",368,financialindependence

190,The 401k early withdrawal penalty is really not that bad,,1115,k78klb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k78klb/the_401k_early_withdrawal_penalty_is_really_not/,1607179176.0,"I often hear of those not wanting to contribute much to their 401k due it being ""locked away until 59.5."" However in my view, the penalty does not make the 401k an untouchable lockbox. All it is is a fee, not some illegal or super complicated thing.


In fact, if you were to FIRE, you could very well come out ahead by putting money into your 401k and then eating the fee vs investing in taxable brokerages. The combination of tax deferment, compounding growth, and effective tax rates could work in your favor.

**Quick and Dirty Math:**

Alice and Bob both plan to FIRE and each needs $40,000 per year to sustain their lifestyle. Alice has $25,000 gross income per year to invest and contributes it to her taxable brokerage account. Bob will take the same $25,000 gross income and invest it between his pre-tax 401k and traditional IRA. We will assume both Alice and Bob are in the 24% federal tax bracket, making about $100k/yr as single filers, and that they receive a 5% annual return. 

Using the 4% rule, Alice's FIRE target is 25x40,000 = **$1,000,000**. She does not meet the threshold to pay any capital gains taxes on withdrawal.

Bob has to adjust his FIRE target since he knows he will be paying the early withdrawal penalty (10%) plus the effective tax rate on his annual withdrawals. His FIRE target is **$1,225,825**, based on 25x ($40,000 + 10% Penalty + Federal Effective Tax Rate of ~8.4%)

|Year|Alice's Year-End Amount|Bob's Year-End Amount|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$19,000|$25,000|
|2|$38,950|$51,250|
|3|$59,898|$78,812|
|4|$81,892|$107,753|
|5|$104,986|$138,140|
|..|..|..|
|25|$906,814|$1,193,177|
|26|$971,115|**$1,277,836**|
|27|**$1,038,713**|$1,366,728|

**Summary:**
Due to the upfront tax burden at a top marginal rate of 24%, Alice can only contribute $19,000 out of the $25,000 she allocates to invest per year. She reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 27.

Bob reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 26, about a year ahead of Alice, despite having a higher target. He gets there first because:

 - He can shovel significantly more money into his investments each year
 - Compounding is working harder in his favor 
 - His effective tax rate in retirement (~8.4%) is lower than the marginal tax rate (24%) he would have paid while working

**Other Thoughts:**

 - If Bob had received an employer match, he would have gotten there even sooner
 - Bob isn't going to pay the penalty forever. At some point he will reach 59.5, stop paying it, and his nest egg will remain larger than Alice's.
 - Alice is going to have a tax drag during her working years due to dividend income, so realistically she'd perform worse (thanks to lurker_cx for making this point)
 - If Alice and Bob made between between $60k/yr and $80k/yr and were in the 22% tax bracket, Bob would have still gotten there sooner but by a smaller margin
 - If they were each married filing jointly, their marginal tax bracket goes down to 22% and Bob's effective tax rate in retirement falls to ~4-5%. He still gets there sooner.
 - It doesn't matter whether you plummet the rate of return to 0% or ratchet it up to 20%, Bob reaches his goal sooner.

**Conclusion:**
The early withdrawal penalty will not kill you. While this is a simplified scenario and your situation may vary, it's very possible you can eat the penalty and *still come out ahead* of investing outside retirement accounts. Of course there are caveats (don't eat the penalty too early) and **there are better paths than doing what Bob did** - diversifying your tax buckets, Roth conversion ladder, etc - but he committed what is often seen as a financial sin and still comes out just fine.",354,financialindependence

I've compiled some of the results into a [visual](https://imgur.com/a/0FRJUDi) with the hope of providing more insight into what traits tend to be shared amongst both those groups in pursuit of FI/RE as well as those who have achieved it.

A few highlights:

1. Commute times are super low. Nearly 70% of respondents had a commute of less than 30 minutes.
2. Of those who have FI/REd nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but perhaps more interestingly an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. 15% had no degree.
3. There was an even split amongst urban and suburban living environments (\~47% each, remaining 6% rural). This held true independently in both the group pursuing FI/RE as well as those who have FI/REd.

If new survey data were to be made available I would love to create a more updated version of this as I'm sure this last year in particular has altered financial behavior in a number of ways.

Note: While this visual also sits on my website (which I won't be linking out of fear of ban), I will never require a subscription or a paywall to access it given that it wouldn't have been possible without community involvement. Nor will I for any visualizations of future survey results.",99,financialindependence

Middle class kid growing up.  Went to college.  As sort of a surprise (due to family stuff), I graduate with 240k debt at a little less 6% not dischargeable in bankruptcy (due to legislative change).  This seems overwhelming on any likely entry-level salary, so I do a professional degree to ensure higher income starting out.

Next, I experience a series of unfortunate events.  My mother takes ill while I'm in school, and I start supporting her and paying her medical expenses out of pocket, which I will do for about 8 years.  This is before you could get insurance for pre-existing conditions so it's rough until Medicare kicks in.  At the same time, wife takes ill, end up doing support and out of pocket off and on for about 4, until she recovers.  At some point, I have to move to an expensive area for work.

So I do about an 80-100 hour week while being generally frugal for 10 years to make ends meet.  I also get very lucky by surviving a couple layoffs with minimal unemployment during the great recession.  Over time, through no fault of my own, my salary grows to about 300-400k/year.  About four years ago, horrible financial things stop happening (more or less), and I take off like a rocket.

Now I'm at a NW of 950k.  500 liquid-ish (not retirement) split 450k invested and 50k in cash.  200k in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (also invested).  250k in house.    700k mortgage at 3%.  One more kid to go.  Two income family, knock on wood.  \~6k/month in total expenses (factoring in deductions).  Could theoretically live on partner's salary, but only just.

Considering doing FIRE once the post-tax money is around 1m and net worth is around 1.7m.  The notion of making less than 2x expenses post tax is terrifying, but I might try a year to focus on health and family at least.

Anyone else screw up and overcorrect their way to financial independence?  I feel like the traditional path is to be a banker or a tech person who rode the Obama/Trump markets, and I seldom see folks like me.",195,financialindependence

In exchange for some self-validation, I'm also going to provide as much info on my journey thus far as I can. I do things a bit differently than the mainstream consensus here, so hopefully I can spark some interesting discussion.

&nbsp;

When I logged into my Personal Capital account this morning, I was greeted by a second comma in my NW number for the first time! Breakdown is as follows:

* Checking: $9,700 (cash)  
* Self Escrow: $8,200 ($750/mo into SNSXX)  
* Emergency Fund ""Cash"": $8,700 (SNSXX)   
* Brokerage: $54,200 (70% Total US / 30% Total Ex-US)  
* Holding (Brokerage): $375,200 (70% Total US / 30% Total Ex-US)  
* Actively Managed: $96,700 (West End Advisors; Global Equity)  
* MLI's: $67,300  
* Roth IRA: $85,100  
* 401k: $296,300  
**Total: $1,001,400**

I know a lot of that doesn't look like the standard FIRE playbook, so I'll provide some additional backstory.

&nbsp;

**Student Loans**  
My parents paid my tuition for my first 2 years and I took out loans for room, board, and general living expenses. After my sophomore year, I landed a fairly lucrative internship (that I returned to after junior year as well) and paid my own way out of pocket for the final 2 years. I graduated with a Petroleum Engineering degree in May 2012 with $32k of student loans.

&nbsp;

**Early Career**  
I landed a job with one of the supermajors and was offered both a ""normal"" engineer-in-training position and a less desirable ""field focused"" position. I opted for the latter because it was a 14/14 rotation schedule (2 weeks on the rig, then 2 weeks vacation), which gave me more flexibility in my living situation and also paid slightly more once travel benefits and per diem stipends were taken into account. Starting pay was $98k/yr with a $10k signing bonus. Since I spent half of the year living on the rig and most of my off-time traveling, I only ended up leasing a storage room to keep all of my shit in. By the end of 2012, I had paid off my student loans on a gross income of ~$60k over those first 7 months following graduation.

After finishing my first 6 months of training, I got a pay bump to $120k and grossed around $135k in my first full calendar year (2013). Since I wasn't sending all of my money each month towards student loans any more, I opened a Vanguard account after finding this sub (lurked with no account for a long time) and starting depositing all of my leftover cash each month into VTSAX. After a year in the field (so halfway through 2013), I was pulled in for a short-term project that was office-based in another state. Since this was only supposed to be a 6-month ""temporary relocation"", I was provided a furnished corporate apartment and daily food stipend. That 6-month assignment turned into a 1yr assignment and then a month later that same boss found another 1yr project he wanted me for, so I ended up living rent-free in that corporate apartment for 2 years and continued shoveling all of my extra cash each month into my Vanguard account. There was also another pay bump when I started the second assignment and, including imputed income from the apartment, I grossed $186k in the second full calendar year.

The end of that second assignment happened to coincide with my completion of the training program and I was missing my old rotation schedule, so I accepted a job as an ops supervisor in our deepwater fleet and went back to the 14/14 life. I ""returned"" to Houston to avoid state income taxes while working offshore (""merchant mariner"" since I only worked in federal waters) and upgraded my storage room to a utilities-included garage apartment I found for $500/month. This new job was also a promotion, so my gross pay for calendar year #3 ended up being $205k. 

That brings us to the end of 2015. At that point, I had worked 3.5 years, had made it past the $200k comp mark, had only paid rent for 6 months ($3k total lol), and had ~$300k saved between my Vanguard account, 401k, and Roth.

&nbsp;

**Buying a House (Wtf is that ""Holding"" account???)**  
Fast forward a couple of years and I was getting burned out doing the offshore gig. All of my best friends were getting engaged, buying houses, having kids, moving into managerial positions etc. while I spent half of my year on a floating tin can and the other half either sleeping in hostels around the world or bringing Tinder girls back to the sketchy garage I ""lived"" in. I didn't feel like I had a purpose in life even though I was ""living the dream"" and making $200-225k each year. I decided it was time to put my technical education to use and transition to a more traditional office-based job. When I told management that I wanted to make a switch, I got offered a deepwater drilling engineer position that came with a relocation package and decided I would buy a house in the new city.

I had also hired a financial advisor in early 2017 when I hit the $500k NW mark and later that year was when I started house shopping. I know financial advisors get a lot of hate here, but I've been pretty happy with mine. He was a guy that had been working as an assistant for my parents' FA that I had talked to a couple of times already. He's only ~8 years older than me and was always the guy that came up with creative ways to boost wealth generation. He had decided to leave the firm that my parents were using to start his own team and was taking on new clients, so I jumped on board. 

After talking with him extensively about it, I decided to go the route of a Securities Backed Mortgage (SBM) when buying my house. This is why there is a separate ""Holding"" account listed above. I knew this wasn't going to be my Forever Home, so I also combined the SBM with a 10yr I/O ARM. What all of this means is that I was able to buy a $495k house with a 0% down payment, no PMI, and I have only made interest payments during my 3 years of ownership. When I bought in Jan 2018, I had ~$285k in my Vanguard account and had ~$40k cash from the relocation package that I planned to use for the down payment. Instead of selling shares to come up with a traditional down payment and then locking up a bunch of capital in home equity, I used the SBM to get credit for a ""20% down payment"" by giving them a lien on enough shares to be a 30% down payment (~$150k). I still have direction over that account (with a few reasonable rules), but it is tied to the house until I have 20% equity (or sell it). That $150k is the maintenance number that I have to stay above, so I moved the full $285k from Vanguard into that holding account to provide enough buffer to weather a ~50% market downturn before getting hit with a call for peace of mind. The $40k cash is what I used to open the actively managed account as a trial and set up a recurring $1k/month that is essentially what would have been going to mortgage principal with a traditional note.

So instead of a $99k down payment and a $2,400/month note ($1600 interest / $800 principal), I kept that $99k invested in index funds and pay $1,500/month in interest while voluntarily making a $1,000/month ""house payment"" to myself. Without getting too deep in the weeds on the numbers, all of this has netted me an extra ~$45k gain over the last 3 years.

&nbsp;

**MLI's**  
This is the other thing that probably looks out of place and is where I've been putting the extra monthly cash that used to get blindly shoveled into Vanguard. The offerings change month to month, but most of these are tied to either DJIA, S&P500, or European Large Cap indexes with leverage amounts in the 120-180% range with the downside being less liquidity due to 3-5yr maturities. If I have $5k that I know I won't touch for 5yrs, why buy S&P500 ETF's when I can buy a 5yr note from Barclays for S&P500 shares with 150% upside leverage? It's a small portion of my total portfolio, but it's a way to squeeze out a little bit more market performance when you know liquidity isn't an issue. My FA sends me the list of these every month and I just tell him what I want, so I'm not sure if this is something available to normal retail accounts or not.

&nbsp;

**FIRE Numbers**  
I've always carried $10k/month as my FIRE target even though it's probably a bit more than I really need (current monthly spend is only ~$6500) because I would need to be on the ""fat"" side of FIRE to justify leaving my career. Also want to have enough of a buffer that deciding to have a family down the road doesn't completely torpedo my plans. That monthly spend target translates to a NW target of $3,000,000, so I'm nowhere close to my full FIRE mark yet. But getting my second comma definitely makes it feel like I'm at least on track and being close to double my CoastFI number ($550k) could be considered the ""FI"" part of FIRE. I could realistically see myself in position to comfortably FIRE around 40-45, depending on how the whole family thing turns out.",89,financialindependence

I've been working towards FIRE for the past 10 years and my projections show that I'm about 9.5 years away from retiring.

I'm a VP at a mid sized tech company with a decent income (about $230k) but underpaid compared to market rates. The job is relatively low stress so I'm not too concerned about being underpaid, but it has its moments where shit can really hit the fan and it takes a lot out of me. 

I don't know if this is a mid life crisis, but like many of you, I'm really starting to feel the grind. I haven't taken more than 4 consecutive* weeks off since I graduated university.

With a baby on the way, I have an opportunity to take parental leave and step away for a few months with a guarantee that I'll have my job waiting for me when I return. My wife is a SAHM in case that matters. 

I'll miss out on about $40k in savings due to the income hit and about 4 months of expenses (another $30k). I'd be delaying FIRE by about a year. 

I do realize that I'll have a newborn through all of this, so it won't truly be a break, but I'm going to have a newborn baby either way.

I have ambitions of potentially using some of the time to try to launch my own business, but that really depends on the kiddos. 

I'm not sure exactly what I'm hoping to achieve with this post. I guess I'd just like to hear about others perspective on this and if anyone else has done something similar. Is it worth delaying FIRE?

I thought I would share my story since I enjoy hearing how other people are doing on their path to FIRE. I have laid it out effectively in terms of school years since I still think in those terms. I only discovered FIRE in the last three years so I also don’t know my net worth for most years but have included estimates that are likely close.

**College and background**

I grew up in a low income household and felt very poor. Ended up at a highly selective liberal arts school. Their financial aid was pretty great at first but fell off a bit. I remember paying only $4,000 for my first year. This jumped to about $10,000 per year for the next three years. Not bad for the experience though. I had only saved a few thousand for college and I wasn’t excited about the prospect of debt, so I worked during school. 25-30 hours a week generally. On top of a very difficult course load (40-60 hours a week on coursework) I ended up feeling very tired and stressed. Looking back I regret working so much. I didn’t even make that much money really.

I studied Physics. A friend of mine tried to get me to take Economics, but it never fit my schedule. I tried to take a Computer Science course, but I couldn’t take it due to demand. I regret both of these things.

**Year 1 (June 2012):**

**Salary $52,000 Cash $12,000 Debt $17,000 NW $-5,000**

While I had always wanted to get a Doctorate, I became disillusioned with the post graduate school job market and decided to enter industry instead. I started working at a small manufacturing company as a Physicist/Manufacturing Engineer. It turns out there are not a lot of options to pursue as a physicist. I didn’t know what I was doing but at least there wasn’t too much pressure on me. Moved to a MCOL area.

Paid off my debts in several months thanks to dirt cheap living expenses (<$1000/month). This was thanks to $400/month rent due to sharing a house with four other people in a not great part of town. I didn’t really track my net worth. I just deposited money in my checking account and tried not to spend too much. I think I put around 8% in my 401k. Looking back, I should have maxed it.

**Year 2:**

**Salary $57,000 NW $20,000?**

Not much to report here. Just worked. Started graduate school part time in Mechanical Engineering. I felt a lack of options with only a Physics degree and felt I would have more options with an MSME. Probably a great choice especially since my work paid for it. I also initially enjoyed classes.

**Year 3:**

**Salary $63,000 NW $50,000?**

I bought the house that I was renting. I probably overpaid for it, but I rented out rooms so it more than paid the mortgage. I guess I was house hacking. It really was about doing something with the money that was just accumulating in my savings account. Investing was scary to me. I borrowed $25,000 from my mother to help me cover the deposit and avoid PMI. I agreed to pay her back over the next 2.5 years.

I also got engaged this year. More on this later. I continued taking classes.

**Year 4:**

**Salary $70,000 NW $100,000?**

I got married! My wife was an artist so didn’t bring in very much money but also was debt free. We kept two renters, but they no longer covered the mortgage. Between a decrease in rent, paying for healthcare for my wife (an extra $400/month), and paying back my mother, things felt very tight. I kept contributing to my 401k though. This brought a fair amount of stress to the relationship. **I highly recommend talking about earning expectations before marriage.** We talked about everything else, but somehow this didn’t come up. I think in part because I was doing fine on my own and didn’t connect the loss of rental income plus increased expenses with marriage. What we did that helped was to budget. This was absolutely critical.

**Year 5:**

**Salary $77,000 NW $140,000?**

This was a big year in many ways. Finished graduate school. Woo! Unfortunately part way through graduate school I realized I didn’t want to be an engineer. I enjoyed the business side of work and should have gotten an MBA.

My wife applied to graduate school as we decided she needed to have a more steady career. We paid off the loan to my mother. The payment was the size of a mortgage, so it felt like we finally had some breathing room.

Perhaps most importantly, this was the year that I discovered FIRE. This was good because I really started disliking my job at some point this year.  **Started maxing my 401k.**

**Year 6:**

**Salary $87,000 NW $175,000?**

I got promoted at work and started managing a team of engineers. I again liked my job though it was more stressful. I also applied to MBA programs. Missed out on top tiers schools (screwing up my Wharton interview is a very sad memory) but got an offer for full tuition at a mid-tier. Thanks to the promotion I decided to do part time grad school again since the company would pay for it. This was painful but probably a good choice.

Started ROTH IRAs for myself and my wife. My wife started graduate school. She worked part time as well. Between part-time work and scholarships, most if not all of the cost was covered.

**Year 7:**

**Salary: $95,000 NW $250,000**

Started grad school. Sold my house and moved to a small 1 BR apartment in a nice part of the city we live in. It was nice to get money out of the house and be able to invest it. I didn’t make a ton from the house sale but it lowered stress. Home ownership, especially for an older home, requires a lot of work.

Started tracking balances every 2 weeks. Felt like this was a good balance of knowing what is happening without getting obsessed.

**Year 8:**

**Salary: $123,000 NW $325,000**

I finished grad school part 2. Wife finished graduate school. I negotiated for a much higher salary at work. Started disliking work again though. Unfortunately covid happened so my wife was furloughed and went to doing gig work. She definitely made some money but it isn’t included in salary here. Started to finally not feel poor as well. That may be silly that it took so long but growing poor leaves marks that take a long time to fade. Something about hitting a significant income level and living in a nicer spot made a big difference.

**Year 8.5 (Present)**

**Salary: $130,000 NW $400,000**

I accepted a job offer in a HCOL/VHCOL city. I will be making less when accounting for cost of living differences, but I think I will enjoy it more and have more growth options (edit: its a technical marketing role). My wife also just started work (another \~$60,000/year). The last time I checked finances we just crossed $400,000, which felt like a big milestone. Hitting six figures in a taxable account just happened as well and this was very exciting.

**My recommendations**:

1. Use a budget. I have had a high savings rate thanks to budgeting.
2. Max out your 401k early (unless it is a terrible fund or something). It will hurt but you can get used to it.
3. Talk about earnings/career expectations before marriage. Create a budget together before getting married.
4. Invest in yourself. Doing part time grad school twice was a good career choice even though it was very difficult. My company paid for it both times.
5. Home ownership can be a great vehicle for wealth building. I found it stressful and detracted from work. Investing in myself and my career will likely end up being a better choice for me. YMMV.

Thanks for reading and for all of the encouragement that this community provides!

Edit: I got a question about NW allocation:

\- Savings: $50K (about to buy a car and move so have been hoarding cash for the last few months)

\- 401K: $185K

\- Roth IRA: $60K

\- Brokerage: $105K

Further edit: target number is $1.25 million. Probably another 12-15 years of work.  


Last edit: A fair number of comments about whether or not I was poor growing up. I grew up in a single-parent family as the youngest of four children. We were below the poverty line until I was at least 12 when a second sibling moved out. I was on free school lunches until it was just me and then I was on reduced school lunches. My mother was a saver who had a full-time job and always took part time gig work as well. So once she was able to save due to her kids moving out, she did. That is why she was able to loan me money at that point (20+ years from when my dad left her). I am sure that plenty of people have worse situations than mine, but I assure you, we were indeed poor when I was young. ",313,financialindependence

Long time lurker, I think a lot of ppl right now are making milestones with how things are going lol, so I figured to throw my hat in and make my first post. 

Raised by my single parent immigrant dad, we were somewhat middle class. Growing up he was really hard on me to do well academically, and I did OK, but honestly didn't do much homework and instead spent most of my time drawing n' posting (honestly pretty cringey) anime/furry art on deviantART starting from age 13. 

But I loved it and took art seriously enough in HS to end up going to art school. It was really expensive and we did not have any sort of college savings, BUT he did take on a lot of parent PLUS loans (which i'm eternally grateful for) while I took out the max in loans I could as a student. Spent the 4 years in college a lot more seriously than HS, knowing how much it cost, and did well. I got a bachelors in animation in '11 and got a job offer a year later to work in mobile games in a VHCOL area in '12. 

**May 2012 - Salary $48,000 -**  Started as a jr animator at a small mobile games start up. It was moderately successful and had just been acquired by a larger company. I got **RSU**s in the company as it was still privately held. **Fun Fact:** since this was my first big boy job I was reading a lot about how to budget a salary around then, and had read Elizabeth Warren's All Your Worth and got started saving in my 401k and Roth IRA because of it. 

**Nov 2014 - Salary  $60,000 -** It turns out those RSUs would be worth something! (around 20k) and all of them would vest immediately when our company got acquired by a public company. Our game was starting to really ramp up at this point, and there was a lot of bonuses and generous raises. I threw most of my windfalls/bonuses at my debt til I paid off all my loans, but my general savings rate was pretty low due to having to balance it with rent in the bay area.

**Jul 2016 - Salary $90,000 -** My salary jumped as I accepted a role in this same startup company as an art manager. We were growing really fast, and there was a need for a lot more artists at this point. This was also around the same time I had found this reddit board and realized ""hey, my salary has gone up a lot while my expenses have stayed pretty stable. This might be possible, although I still enjoy my job"" So I started pouring a lot more into my savings. Maxing out my 401k, my Roth IRA, and saving another 1k\~2k each month into VTSAX. I also get married soon after this point! 

**Jan 2018 - Salary $100,000 - NW $120,000 -** Uh oh, corporate sells the division I work at to a different corporate overlord. Lots of coworkers end up leaving, the culture at the company really starts changing. A game we were excited about gets canned. I'm not sure I even want to work in mobile games anymore as all of them have kind of moved towards very predatory ways of monetizing. But my job was honestly still pretty comfortable and I started really getting into FI/RE. Being frugal and still trying to do my best at work to grow my salary. At this point I set my mission to **save up 900k** and then quit my job **to work on indie games**. 

**Today - Salary $120,000 - NW $333,333 -** A lot of the same feelings from 2.5 years ago, but I've still stuck around at the same company. Just hunkering down and saving. I remember reading on the reddit here that the first 100k is the hardest to make, and then after that it gets much easier. Whoever said that was SO right. It's crazy watching all my investments grow lately.

**So what's next?** I've been setting aside money from each month from my very first paycheck to give to my dad to help repay those Parent PLUS loans. My rent (crazy enough) has not gone up since 2016, so my monthly spend is around 2500\~3000 per month (rent, bills, groceries, fun money) and the rest is saved up. My husband (also an animator) has had bouts on unemployment, but finally landed a stable job last year. He doesn't plan on retiring early at all, but is very supportive of me wanting to (very grateful for him too) . At the rate I'm going I think I'll be able to retire when i'm 36? In the mean time, i've been teaching myself to code and use various game developer tools. I'm still quite a novice in areas that aren't art related, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.   


**tl;dr-** 

* Dad took on a lot of my college expenses
* I graduated and got into an industry at the right time.
* Got into management via art to make 6 figures
* DINKs with stable rent
* Have been able to WFH throughout the pandemic. 

Happy to answer any questions, but otherwise am just gonna keep on keeping on til I can pull the cord. Hope to make that post soon :)",49,financialindependence
205,FIRE in other Countries/ Currencys,,27,k5l0e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k5l0e6/fire_in_other_countries_currencys/,1606951109.0,"Hi, im writing from México and im also interested in FIRE.

I suppose the majority of posts around here come from the USA because I read a lot about 401k, Roth, IRA, etc. which im not really into it because from another countries, retirement plans are different.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Correct me if im wrong

I have read a lot about FIRE'ing at 1M (USD) with a ""4% interest rule"". As I understand that translates into 40k interest anually (or $3333.33)  which should be enough for living. (I know it depends on which city and a budget)

A major difference about México and USA from my perspective is the salary. Ive read normal salaries ranges from $40k-$120k USD anually (before taxes?) 

From perspective, lets suppose a person earns $80k salary, after taxes it is like $60k (I dont really know how much less) and from those 60k that persons spends 65% and saves 35% each month. That translates to $19.2k net savings. 

After some many years, saving, investment, etc one can reach the 1M or desired FIRE goal.

I dont know if this is right but im speculating. What am i missing?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, from México, a normal salary would be around $12.5k to 37.5k USD(Anually). I know theres a lot of difference vs USA but living costs (Food, rent, restaurants, medical expenses, etc) are much lower. 15k-18k should be enough for living in an average city in México. The only things that are ""kind of expensive"" to us mexicans with a salary 2-3 times lower because the cost the same here or there are not indispensable things like an Iphones, computers, cars, etc  or some other non basic somewhat imported stuff.

Lets take an example of a person that earns $25k, after taxes it is about $20k. And with an speding of 65% and saving rate of 35% it ends with $7k anually.

That same person needs almost as 3 times more to reach the same 1M.

According to the 4% (which is about the interest rate in México) to get 18k anually you would need 450k USD

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

450k USD is  is 2.22 times less that 1M but you would need: lets say 64 years at 7k per year saving rate) vs 52 years for 1M at 19.2k savings rate. So conclusion, you need more time for the desired FIRE number.

Those numbers are some aproach (I guess). Feel free to make any comparisons and discuss.",25,financialindependence

By any discernible measure, we could spend our days doing whatever we wish, which was the motivation for FI in the first place.  Yet, our respective grinds continue.  Neither of us are particularly enamored with our work but are highly competent and thus paid well.

I daydream about hiking national parks, reading, oil painting, learning a new instrument or volunteering my time for financial literacy causes.  Instead, I find myself making (SUPER) dull drives across the Midwest, making sales calls and staying in Marriott Courtyards.  The corporate minions are pleased but, more and more, I am not.

To change things up with work, I recently moved to a sexier division (more attractive technology) and this does not seem to be hitting the mark either.  It is the same game with a different widget and a bigger paycheck.  It is exceedingly difficult to stay motivated when we have already won the game.

If anyone has been in a similar situation then I am all ears.  How did you get off of the hamster wheel?

I just collected a lump sump pension, so I'm pretty much done working (own my own home worth about $500k) and have about $5m invested.  My wife and I will both receive small pensions (total <$500/mo) and social security.  My dilemma is that I have about $3.5m in pre-tax (IRA) money (I know - a good problem to have).  I also have about $500k in Roth and the remainder is in an after-tax account.  I know the best financial plan is to start converting IRA to Roth, but the big question is how much should I be converting per year.  I know my decisions now will affect tax rates and Medicare surcharges years down the line as well as affect the eventual (I hope) inheritance to my heirs.

Is there any good software out there that can automatically (or even manually) run simulations and give me an idea what the best strategy would be to do Roth conversions now?  Ideally, it would know about the tax law changes coming in 2025 and Social Security / Medicare rules.  

I've signed up for MaxiFi - it's OK, but isn't really what I want.  I had a CPA demo eMoney software for me that seemed really good, but it wasn't ""hand's on"" - I'd have to hire him for many thousands a year to gain access to the output.

210,9.1% Permanent Reduction In Social Security Benefits To The 4 Million Turning 60 In 2020 Due to COVID-19 - Misleading,,150,k4rlv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k4rlv8/91_permanent_reduction_in_social_security/,1606849619.0,"**Update:** It turns out the headline is not misleading as pointed out below by /u/gregable

# Background

A co-worker sent me an article I can't seem to link to properly - https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20200912157/a-drop-in-social-securitys-average-wage-index-could-hurt-four-million-people The article purports that the affect of COVID-19 in 2020 will permanently reduce their Social Security benefits by 9.1% because of the [Adjusted Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  I read the article and found that while a good portion of it was sound, the conclusions were misleading.  I am posting here for two reasons:

* I am hoping the community can help substantiate and/or refute the article and my interpretation of it
* I assume most still working FIRE folks don't give much weight to social security (nice to have) and I also assume that they are aiming for pre-60 retirement.  On the other hand, Social Security is a complicated beast to understand so by sharing why I think this article is misleading, I am also helping to educate for those who want to understand.

# How Social Security Is Calculated

I actually found [this article](https://www.fool.com/retirement/whats-the-social-security-benefit-formula.aspx) and the [ssa.tools](https://ssa.tools/calculator.html) results easier to understand than what was on the SSA website.

# Step 1 - Determine Your Wages For Each Year

This can be done using the [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/) website and going to your earnings history.  A couple of things to note:

* If you are a high wage earner, you may find that the amount reflected in a given year is less than you actually earned - this is because there is a maximum each year after which income is no longer considered for social security purposes
* These are starting values - they get adjusted in the next step

# Step 2 - Adjust The Wages For Inflation

**This** is the step the article is saying will result in a permanent 9.1% drop in benefits but I believe is misleading.  This is done using the [Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  Things I think the article got right

* The year that matters is the year you turn 60 (2 years prior to being first eligible)
* 2020 will very likely be lower than originally predicted.  The article says:  The [2020 Trustees Report](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2020/index.html) projected that the AWI, which equals total wages in the year divided by the number of wage earners, would increase by 3.5% from 2019 to 2020.  It later goes on to say: experience so far in 2020 suggests that total wages will be about 10% lower than projected in the 2020 Trustees Report and the number of workers will be about 1% lower than projected. (The number of workers doesn't decline very much because AWI includes all wage earners even if they only worked for the month of January.) If these percentage declines play out, then the average wage index will be 9.1% (1 -- 90/99) lower than projected for 2020  
* The affect will be permanent for those turning 60 this year without legislation (the article mentions 2 bills already created to address)


What I disagree with in the article is:  *Assuming these declines come to pass, about four million people will receive benefits that are 9.1% less than expected*



Instead, I think it should read:  Assuming these declines come to pass, about four million people will receive benefits that are **based on earnings** 9.1% less than expected.

**I have already made this section long enough because this is the crux of the issue but suffice it to say, the AWI is used to adjust the earnings history from step 1**

# Step 3 - Calculate Your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

* Identify the highest 35 earning years from step 1 after applying step 2
* Divide the sum by 35 and then again by 12

**This is what you made on-average per month through your 35 highest earning years and will be what your SS benefit will be based on**

# Step 4 - Identify Your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

You can think of the next step almost like reverse tax brackets.  Essentially a progressively smaller portion of your AIME contributes to your benefit amount.  There are only 3 brackets - called bend points.  [Here is a table of them](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/bendpoints.html) as they change each year.  I will use 2021 for the purposes of the example applying [the PIA formula](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html):

* 90% of the first $996
* 32% of any amount between $998 and $6002
* 15% of any amount above $6002

# Step 5 Adjust for Cost Of Living &amp; Age Of Starting Benefits

[Cost Of Living Adjustments](https://www.ssa.gov/cola/) apply but aren't really germane to the conversation.  Additionally, the amount of your PIA (monthly benefit) is adjusted based on the age you retire.  For most everyone, the PIA in the previous step is based on starting benefits at age 67.  You can take benefits as early as 62.  The benefits can even increase beyond the PIA in the previous step if you delay taking the benefits past 67 but it maxes out at age 70.

# Conclusion

Because of the way the bend points work, I don't believe the impact of the AWI in 2020 can have the impact the article suggests.  Social Security is intentionally capped in two ways

* There is a maximum amount you can earn in any given year that counts towards social security
* The last bend point is set to 15% meaning you only get 15 cents for every dollar earned above that bend point.

I did one calculation based off a AIME of 8333 (100K annually) and the difference was a hair under 4% - still substantial and worth fighting over but less than half of the number claimed by the article.

# What did I miss?

I am going to share this post with my co-worker so please provide any comments about mistakes I made or things that would be worth adding.

**Update:** As pointed out by /u/gregable below, the bend points are also tied to the AWI which means the article was not misleading after all.  2020's AWI (age 60) will be reflected in the 2022 bend points (age 62).  I had incorrectly assumed they were unrelated since it appears as 2021 values are already out when in reality they are tied to 2019's AWI.",46,financialindependence
211,Roth 401k for Roth Conversion Ladders?,,55,k4xw8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k4xw8v/roth_401k_for_roth_conversion_ladders/,1606868483.0,"Hello all! I think I understand the general principal of a Roth Conversion Ladder. But I have a few questions.

1. If you retired at age 45, you couldn’t begin making conversions from a 401k/IRA into a Roth IRA until that year, right? Those first 5 years of retirement, you’d need to live off Roth IRA contributions, Taxable Brokerage Accounts, and Cash, right?

2. How does a Roth Conversion Ladder work if you have lots of $$ in a Roth 401k? Is it all the same except you don’t pay tax on the money when it’s converted? Just wanting to make sure I understand that as it would guide my investing strategy a bit if I couldn’t do this ladder conversion with a Roth 401k.

3. If the answer to the above is that you CAN do this sort of conversion... I understand the theory of wanting to make sure you convert enough $$ 5 years ahead of time that you can live off of it. But can someone explain why you’ve wouldn’t just convert more every year? I understand in a traditional 401k conversion that you’d end up paying more in taxes if you did like $200k In one year vs $40k over 5 years. But not so if it was coming from a post tax source. You could just roll over the entirety of the Roth 401k into a Roth IRA and after 5 years, withdraw it? Do I need to wait 5 years still?

I’m considering the idea of ceasing contributions to those accounts (403bs for each and Roth IRAs) and putting all our extra money into other investments.  The 450k is reallocated each year following the bogleheads 3 fund strategy, but a bit heavier on VTSAX.

We also own a 4plex (180k at purchase) which about breaks even and a townhouse (250k) at purchase.  Rents are 3,000 and 1850 per month, respectively.

If we don’t contribute anymore to the retirement accounts I figure that when I’m 62, we’ll have just over 2MM in retirement fund assuming 6% annual growth.  And I think that’s enough.

In a nutshell, if your parents ran themselves flat broke because they were irresponsible - and yet you were very responsible and FIRE’d, your state may be able to come after your hard-earned finances too.  Your parents credit card debts may not be able to be transferred to you, but depending on your state their medical costs potentially could.

218,"Time value of money, how much is your day worth? A new perspective",,0,k47gdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k47gdr/time_value_of_money_how_much_is_your_day_worth_a/,1606776799.0,"# Rule of 3600

""$1 today is worth $15 in 40 years"" doesn't really capture well what investing a dollar today actually means in terms of your goals. Most of us here aren't trying to buy more stuff, we're trying to buy time and freedom.

So, what does time cost? The formula is quite simple:

**cost\_of\_one\_day = net\_worth\_dollars / 3600**

This means if your net worth is **$3,600**, investing **$1** buys you **1 day of retirement** in the future, no matter your target number or age. This way of seeing things captures why it's so important to invest when your net worth is low (usually applies to young people). When your net worth is **$1,000,000**, it takes **$278** to buy **1 day of retirement** in the future. This gives some perspective of what it costs in terms of time to continue working; if someone works **250 days** a year and dumps their whole income into investments, they would need to earn **$69,500 net** to break even, otherwise they're valuing security or money over their time (that's okay, just be conscious of it), or because they enjoy their job more than retiring.

**Formula #2**

**days\_each\_dollar\_buys = 3600 / net\_worth\_dollars**

# How?

Each year of investing has an **expected return of 7%** of your net worth. This translates to **0.028%** per working day (**250** in a year), which is roughly 1/3571 or **\~1/3600**. So for each **$3,600** invested, you're expected to make **\~$1** per day on the stock market. By investing additional money, you're buying guaranteed returns; at $3,600 invested, you're buying 1 day of guaranteed returns with each dollar.

# Applied to investment psychology

**Stock market crashes and corrections**

When the stock market crashes or corrects, your net worth drops, and each additional dollar invested buys more time than before the crash/correction. Remember this, and you'll be psychologically inclined to buy low.

**CoastFIRE**

At a certain dollar amount, a person might decide that they value spending those dollars than have an extra day of freedom in their life. I think most people would say that they'd rather have an extra day of freedom than spend $1. Probably the same for $10. Maybe at $100 per day, some people might say no they'd rather have fun with friends, family, or buy/experience something they always wanted than have an extra day. If $100 is that threshold, then your CoastFIRE number is $360,000. If you have absolutely nothing to do with free time, such as just wasting your day browsing Reddit, ask yourself ""would I pay $100 at $360,000 net worth to browse Reddit for a whole day?"" This should hit hard on some people, because retirement is pretty boring if you don't develop hobbies to do once you pull the trigger. The more fulfilling your life currently is, the higher your CoastFIRE number should be (e.g. I would pay $500 for an extra day of cycling the Alpes vs. $5 for an extra day of browsing Reddit/sitting around/mindless activity), and vice-versa. Psychologically, this helps people with boring lives spend more/develop hobbies, and people with more exciting lives value investing more. It naturally settles onto a sweet spot.

**Asset allocation**

The higher the expected returns of an investment, the high the risk, and the more costly it is to buy a day of time. This helps adjust risk too as you approach FIRE. If you're investing in a high flying tech stock that returns 30% a year, then the rule of 3600 becomes the rule of 833. This means that at $200,000 invested, it already costs $240 to buy a day of time with that tech stock; perhaps it's more worth it to buy VTI/VTSAX for $55 a day at that point, or even earlier? Then let's say you have $400,000 invested in 50% tech and 50% VTI, your average daily cost of time is $295. If you're earning less than $295 per day, you're taking too much risk with that portfolio. Let's say you earn $240 a day net, so you want to rebalance to get your average daily cost of time to $240; sell $61,325 of tech, and buy VTI with it, now you have $139,675 of tech and $261,325 of VTI. The goal of financial independence is to reach average daily cost of time equal to your daily net income with a portfolio of 100% VTI, and whenever your portfolio has an average daily cost higher than your daily net income, it gives you a sign that you should de-risk. After FIRE, this could mean setting up bond tents, having 1-2 years expenses in cash, investing in hedge funds for the very rich.

PS: this method works for almost any investment. For example, BTC. It returns on average 130-140% a year. That's a rule of 260. If you're earning $100 a day net, your max investment in BTC should not exceed $26,000. If you're ""investing"" in call options which have an expected 3x return in a month, that's a rule of 0.0006868118945. If you're earning $100 a day net, then your max allocation to that call option should be around 7 cents, otherwise you're taking too much risk (i.e. gambling). In other words, unless you're earning $145,600 a day after taxes, you should never buy even a single call option contract of that kind (\~$100).",75,financialindependence

Now what?,,191,k31vsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k31vsl/we_technically_reached_financial_independence_now/,1606619600.0,"I calculated today, my wife and I currently have enough money in investments, that on average we can pay for all of our expenses using investment money. (Note that this is an average. Sometimes we make more money. Sometimes we make less. It would be unwise to completely depend on investment money only.)

Both of us have high paying jobs.. all of this income is just going to add onto the investments, since we already cover all of our costs with the investment income.

I am having a ""midlife crisis"" about what my future job should be. I work as a software engineer. I have always been the smart computer kid in school, but over the decades, technology has been changing so much, it has been hard to keep up. I am wondering how long I will be able to keep this up before employers start just going for someone younger.

We have a family. Time with the kids is important. I am starting to look at my typical job, with 8 hours + 1 hour for lunch + 1 hour commute in each direction, that is 11 hours used for work, that I am wondering if I can reduce significantly.

I don't really care about the pay too much.. But I am not ready to work for free. I just want to be productive, and mentally challenged at work, but then be able leave all of that and not deal with it when I come home.

I don't like the idea of being a freelancer, because then I need to negotiate how much money I will be paid, which I don't really care about. I'd prefer a project where I don't have much responsibility to a deliver a project, and instead I would prefer to be an advisor or teacher.

At the same time, I recognize, we can now afford certain services that we previously have not done much because we felt it was too expensive. A few examples:

1. Having people clean our place. (Because it gets overwhelming with kids to keep it clean.)
2. Having prepared foods be delivered to us regularly. (Although we try cooking once in a while, it is not something we really enjoy doing. And we are concerned about our kids eating healthy.)
3. Going on more vacations.
4. Getting a nanny/babysitter supplimenting the daycare.
5. Donate more money.

Currently we continue to go the same path and accumulate wealth, and are starting to spend more on the things listed above, but as the wealth accumulates, I keep getting a stronger urge to change my job to something else.. but I don't know to what.",108,financialindependence

I even posted a while ago about the best way to split the purchase of a home with my partner, and overwhelmingly people say it's much riskier to buy a house with a non-married partner than with a married partner. 

If there are protections, then why are pre-nup agreements recommended? It seems to me that if you're worried about pre-nups, then an option (if both people are fine with it) is to not get married and simply be cohabiting partners. But I've read and been told that purchasing assets with someone that you're not married to is risky.

So I'm trying to better understand what protections marriage offer and what they can't protect that a pre-nup could.

I used to think work was what woke me up at night, but realized that my mind is naturally anxious and then anything really took work’s place in my mind - sometimes much more concerning stuff. As such, the motivation to drop work to feel more at peace isn’t something I’ll achieve in RE. Maybe the problem is just me here, not my career nor my clients. And in a way, that anxiety is easier because it’s not really existential. So I’m getting to a stage where I’m thinking doing some work on the side to coast my way through (even beyond FIRE) might be a better option - keep my mind busy, find reasons to look at other problems than my own, etc.

TLDR: I STILL really am struggling to find a new challenge. I have been applying to positions but I am not having much success finding the right opportunity. I still have different and specific goals but I am unable to get them on my current path.

- How do people get motivated, again, after being out on their own for 4-5 years?

Here are some more updates/realizations in my life:

1. We had our second child this year. We're unlikely to have another one.
2. I am still in my mid 30s.
3. I got too comfortable, I want a challenge again.
4. Our health insurance and benefits are subpar.
5. Net Worth is about $1.9 MM and the balance sheet is below.
6. We don't own our primary residence, we rent. We have been displaced due to COVID.

-

I really don't like my current business. It is more of a good side gig. I am not challenged by it either. I would rather coast with it now and find a more challenging opportunity, even if that means working for someone else.  I have been looking for a new opportunity for over year and I am struggling to find the right fit. I am not looking for a high salary, but I would really good benefits because our current health insurance is subpar and I have already had serious health issues. My goal is to be ""done"" by 45 and simply manage my business.

-

Here are my specific questions:

1. Does anyone have specific suggestions about the transition back into the system (going from being on your own to working for someone else)?

2. Does anyone have any coping suggestions about the transition? I am concerned that I am going to miss my young children so much. Working from home allows some great benefits.

3. How long did it take you to readjust?

4. Were your able to readjust?

225,Calculating SWR With Large Expected Social Security Benefit,,205,k1uizn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k1uizn/calculating_swr_with_large_expected_social/,1606452249.0,"I realize this is probably ""in the weeds"" for all those except the few out there in a similar situation as we are: Those retired or retiring in their 50s with a sizable Social Security balance...and trying to figure out how much to add to the 3.5% (or 3.25%) safe withdrawal rate (SWR) we apply to our net investable assets exclusive of the SS. The purpose of this post is to share our approach and see if others have any other methods they might find useful. It probably also goes without saying that poking holes in our thinking is fair game and appreciated :-). 

Some stats:

\>>M/57 and F/52 retired early 2019

\>>$1.9M net worth

\>>$1.6M Investable Assets (which we use to calculate our SWR...the remainder of NW being our home which we own outright).

\>>$75k/yr (today's dollars) Expected Social Security at m/70 f/65 with net present value (NPV) of $1.2M.

\>>30 year horizon. (Our plan is to make certain that the surviving spouse will have paid for home, $43k/yr SS + residual portfolio which will not allow to dip below at least a few hundred thousand dollars. 

\>>We plan to recalculate our SWR annually with a strong commitment to reducing spending if our investable assets drop substantially. We are in a fortunate position in that we would be ok with 75% of our current budget if conditions required it. This does allow us to take on a bit more risk in choosing a SWR.

If you retire very early, the SS doesn't add much to your SWR. If you retire later, you can just add your SS benefit you're already receiving to your SWR. But we're in the middle, where we have to span 13 more years to SS but want to work out a SWR that will be fairly flat for our entire retirement (though it will be funded mostly from our investments for the next 13 years and mostly from SS after that).

We've used three methods to perform these calculations. Interestingly, they all tell a similar story (which I guess is good).  (Of course we're bracing for any possible cuts to Social Security...and will adjust accordingly. But every year that goes by seems to make it more likely the changes won't affect our demographic...or if so, not much. I'm not of the opinion it will be politically feasible to just apply a 25% or whatever cut to those on SS or those close to receiving it.)

Here's what we used for SWR to reach our $105k budget for next year:

1) Backing into SWR via trial/error on [Firecalc.com](https://Firecalc.com). This method yields a SWR of around $95k (5.9%) flat or $105 to start backing down to $85K in the out years. (The ""success rate"" we were shooting for here was 95%+. This seems comfortable in that we're ready to reduce our budget as soon as next year if the market dips.)

2) Using the NPV of our Social Security account ($1.2M) as additive to our Investable Assets ($1.6M) and applying 3.5% = $98k SWR. (I realize the SS account underperforms bonds in terms of asset allocation on average, though by pacing inflation it's actually currently significantly outperforming any ""safe"" bonds or other fixed income investments. Still this probably suggests that this estimate is a little high and a somewhat lower SWR should be used.

3) ERN's tool. ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/)) It also yielded the most generous SWR of 6.3% when we calculated it last year. ERN show three levels of risk. The lowest level resulted in 5.4% SWR, the middle 6.3% and the riskiest 6.8%. We used the middle and that works out to around $104k SWR. (Note: ERN's shortest retirement period was 40 years, which we used.)

We're at the higher end of these estimates with a $105k budget for 2021....but feel that's offset by the fact we're not locking in a spending number for more than a year. We plan to 100% start over determining our SWR for 2022 with effectively no minimums. This also will effectively stretch our retirement horizon to a new 30 years each year, adding safety. 

Any other tools out there you're using? Are we looking at this wrong in any way? It's not too late to lower that budget for 2021! :-)",64,financialindependence

228,How does it feel to have two commas? My Thanks,,1463,k1d0gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k1d0gp/how_does_it_feel_to_have_two_commas_my_thanks/,1606386912.0,"Today I woke up with something to definitely be thankful for. I saw that I officially became a member of the two comma (or dot/space) club. How does it feel? To be honest, it feels exactly the same as it did when my NW still had one comma. 

I don’t make six or seven figures. I don’t have any crypto. Not a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or other high earner. I still make a five figure base salary as I did when I got my first “real paying” job.  For the curious, mostly admin office stuff, new media, and resource mgmt).  20s underemployed and drowning in med bills, yada, yada, yada.

My allocation is approx. 34%ish 401k, 52%ish 3 fund brokerage (VTSAX, VBTLX, VTIAX), 12%ish jumbo CD, and the rest in cash. 

My tastes and hobbies are still the same. Still have bills to pay. Still appreciate the same things: peace of mind, friends and family, cooking and eating, and enjoying new people, places, and experiences.

I don’t fully subscribe to some of the FI beliefs I see in the sub like the remaining in a particular paying job despite the high levels of job dissatisfaction and the constant questions of how one would fill their time if not working. I am ok with my job, and have plenty of outside hobbies and interests to keep me busy. In fact, I am still planning a leave of absence soon to be able to spend more time with family and in my causes. Pandemic be darned. 

All said, I still have a ways to go in reaching my goals though.

Here are things I wish I knew earlier in this journey:

Start saving and investing as early as you can. Really, as early as you can. Compounding is no joke. When I got my first real job offer, I did not sign up for 401k deductions. I now see that as a mistake. Three years and a few more jobs and unemployment periods later, I signed up for the max deductions in my new job and have been maxing it out in my jobs since. 

Don’t be afraid of a little risk.  A month after my first 401k deduction, I saw my balance declining. I freaked out and moved my money into a safer fund (but did not reduce my contributions). The money later recovered with the market and then some. This pattern would repeat over the years. Now I know that this is normal, and that we need to be in it for the long haul.

Speaking of risk, after discovering this sub three years ago I decided to open a brokerage account and slowly dump my money in there. Lots more fluctuations than my 401k but I stayed in. Good move clearly. I now see I had nothing to fear in opening an account. 

Take care of your health. Medical bills are killer.  I spent my 20s underemployed and broke, plus drowning in 10s of thousands of dollars of medical bills. The collectors are simply vicious. It took me years just to get to 0. Taking care of your health also puts you in a position to maximize work opportunities.  For one of my temp jobs it required a special physical to make sure I could handle the job.  If I failed that due to bad health, I’d not be where I am today. 

Be open minded and adventurous. I have taken jobs in the past 10 years that have come my way completely by surprise. Like that one I mentioned about the special physical. All were amazing experiences. While some I would not do again, I appreciate the experience and memories I got from them. 

Know your limits and when to stop. I have quit a few jobs too over bad bosses, bad and toxic working conditions, and when I saw the job weighing on my health. No job is worth your life. Be prepared to walk away for yourself and family if need be.

Frugal is ok. This is me. I have always been frugal. Growing up living in the projects had a part in that. But also I don’t put a lot of stock in collecting material things. I like doing things with people, from walking around together to home cooking together. These cost much less than other things. 

Value and focus on experiences and people over money and possessions. Nuff said. 

That’s my very long story in a nutshell. I may update as needed.",201,financialindependence

# Account Values

I started working weeks before the Lehman collapse. Didn't really know what was happening at the time. My NW before 2014 are all estimates as I was not tracking anything during that time period.

Salary and Bonus from early years are estimates. 

&#x200B;

**2008: -$20,000.**Salary: 65k | Bonus: 0k

Student loans, irresponsible credit card debt accrued in college killed me the first few months of adult life. $65k entry salary.

**2009: $25,000**Salary: 65k | Bonus: 25k

A sign on bonus, year end bonus, and tax return wiped out most of my credit card debt

**2010: $60,000**Salary: 75k| Bonus: 15k

Was making about $100,000 at this point. Didn't save anything as I was partying but decent investments propelled my net worth up

**2011: $100,000**Salary: 85k | Bonus: 25k

More of the same

**2012: $170,000**Salary: 100k | Bonus: ??

Started some side hustles that took off but really didn't save much still.

**2013: $220,000**Salary: 100k | Bonus: ??

Continued side hustles and started saving some more money.

**2014: $280,000**Salary: 110k | Bonus: ??

Combination of market returns, decent savings, and continued side hustles propelled me further up

**2015: $350,000**Salary: 120k | Bonus: 30k

Bought an apartment, discovered FI/RE. Race was on. Started maxing out 401k.

**2016: $475,000**Salary: 140k | Bonus: 50k

70% savings rate and market returns really helped, also real estate appreciation

**2017: $650,000**Salary: 150k | Bonus $50k

More of the same, making over $200k by this point, and market returns helped, real estate appreciation

**2018: $760,000**Salary: $160k | Bonus $55k

More of the same, market drop in equities and real estate

**2019: $875,000S**Salary: 120k euro | 30k euro

Moved to Europe. More of the same, got a lot of extra cash flow from relocation bonuses and performance bonuses from moving to Europe. Making about 150k euros which turns out is MUCH better than making 200k in NYC.

**2020: $1,080,000**Salary: 120k euro | 30k euro

Had a decent cash bonus at the beginning of the year and put it towards the market at the right time. Bought heavy in some tech ETFs which have nearly 2x'd since.

**2021 Outlook: $1,150,000**

I had a package offer on the table to leave and took it which will be quite a nice reprieve. I think the timing isn't ideal because i'd have preferred to just wait until the pandemic was over because there's not much to do right now. I didn't want to wait around for company's minds to change so better now than never. Plus, I'm confident i could always find something else if that's what I feel like doing.

&#x200B;

# Portfolio Breakdown 

Here is a breakdown of my current figures. Not exact figures but rough amounts. My portfolio mostly invested in broad market ETFs, and a chunk of tech ETFs. Few single name stocks just to keep things interesting.

**Cash:** 10k

**Brokerage Account:** $600k

**IRA:** $180k

**Roth IRA:** $20k

**Home Equity:** $250-300k (plan to sell this house in the next year)

**Credit card points** \~ $20k (I engage heavily in churning)

&#x200B;

# What to FIRE to?

I think the most important part of FIRE is the age-old saying to retire to **something**. It's countless times now that I've read on this sub of people having FIRE'd, getting bored, losing their way, and being a lost soul. Then there are some people that genuinely can just do nothing, but that's not me.

I always knew from day one that as soon as I FIRE'd, it would be to pursue my real interests and passions. If these interests and passions lead me to another career where I make money, then so be it, I still consider myself FIRE because I know i can peace out if I lost interest. As someone planning to FIRE in their mid 30s, it's imperative to have this figured out as doing nothing from here on out is a surefire way to an early death.

My passion has always been to travel the world full time, work as a dive instructor and have some sort of travel consultancy business. I have a blog and travel business that was on track to generate $20k+ in 2020 but as soon as COVID taking flight in March, traffic and revenue fell 60-70%. The dive industry is completely decimated because no one can travel so don't expect any cool instructor positions to open up any time soon.

It's safe to say that all of those things are on hold for the foreseeable future so whatever I was planning to FIRE to is uncertain now. It's a strange and unfamiliar feeling because as a person, I've always looked to the future, often times in a daydreaming type of way. Now, I am firmly grounded to the present, not knowing what the future holds or when the future can take place.

&#x200B;

# What to do now?

So as I write this post, I'm at my beautiful little boutique hotel on Zanzibar Island. They're open to tourists and although I've been here in the past, it's an absolute heaven right now with so few tourists and everything being half off.

I've been here for a few weeks now and have mostly been diving, chilling out, and working on the blog. In my mind, it beats being locked down in the cold back in Europe and gives me time to figure out what to do next. Plus it's just beautiful here.

For expenses, I always targeted $40k yearly expenses which I think will go quite far in most of the world, although not very far if I'm trying to go on safaris and shit in Africa. This was between a 3.5-4% withdrawal rate. My blog was looking to supplement this 50% or so but now it's more like 20% (but still better than nothing).

Think for now, I will chill here and wait it out until othe rparts of the world open and see what happens. But it would appear that I'm FIRE'd and wasn't sure how I felt about it at first but with these views, I can't complain!",33,financialindependence

$270,000 in individual stocks (small positions in tech that grew exponentially - mainly Tesla \*shocked Pikachu face\*)

$100,000 in crypto (small investment that grew exponentially)

Total: approximately $1,000,000

How? Tons of amazing opportunity, a genuine love of technology (and great jobs in the tech industry), a ton of luck, steadfast frugality, and relentless investing... Step by step:

1. Graduated college in 2011 without debt due to choosing a state school, financial aid, scholarships, family support, and a couple summer internships (one unpaid, two paid). 
2. 10 years in the tech industry. Started strong ($72,000 a year total compensation), moved companies three times, and was promoted once. Current compensation is now $150,000 a year after all that. I have never taken more than 1 week off between jobs and always had the next thing lined up.
3. I watched all the people my age at the tech companies I worked for spend money on eating out, fancy apartments, brand-new cars. I got a low-end apartment with roommates even after I got my first real job. Most my happiness came from spending time with my frugal spouse, playing sports, basic tech items like phones/video games, and my dog that I got after 1 year working. I still ate very cheaply and never ordered alcohol out. This left lots of money for maxing all my tax advantaged accounts, further index fund stock investing, and then that 5% or so for the high risk ""fun"" investments that I happened to hit on.
4. I read about technology every day for fun via a simple news aggregator. I scan the headlines and then usually end up reading 3-4 articles a day that interest me. I always try and think about what will affect the world the most and how it will do so... and whether or not there is an investing angle that the general public isn't yet privy to. 
5. Put most my money in 100% stock index funds as I started out as kind of an aggressive boglehead and still am in a lot of ways. As years passed I put 5% or so into ""fun""/high risk investing when I saw something cool crop up. Learned about crypto in late 2013 during the bull run up to $1,000. Invested a tiny bit of money in bitcoin near the top there and got burned - watched the price cut in half. Doubled down and never looked back (wish I had continued to dollar cost average but c'est la vie). 3 years later I finally crossed into the profitable range but continued to hold! I am a Tesla fan so over the last few years I have slowly thrown a few hundred dollars into $TSLA here and there for fun once my retirement accounts were all maxed out for the year. Looked at it as a potential charitable investment to try and help the environment and also maybe a fun fund to buy a cool car someday if it did well. Watched it stagnate for years and then eventually now this huge run-up has propelled my net worth substantially (better make the post quick before the 7 figures NW goes away!!!).

Alright... so... what? Are my take-a-ways going to be that different than everyone else's? Not really but here is my spin on it anyways.

1. **You don't have to fit in with the crowd.** I am a FIRE zealot amongst my friends and that provides an interesting perspective in the corporate world. I always try to pay my own way and (especially now) find times to be generous, but I also try and steer my friends to make responsible financial choices and overall it has been good for my social relationships.
2. **Your spouse is going to almost assuredly be the most important person in your life.** I met my significant other at a young age. When we were in college, we had no money so we got used to spending nothing and still enjoying each other's company. She is frugal too and has her own story to share. She has quite the impressive portfolio and net worth herself and we have ultimately bonded over money. It is amazing to have a hard working and financially supportive partner. 
3. **Most hobbies can be accomplished within very reasonable budgets if you plan well and only purchase things you are really going to use.** Animals are awesome. Sports are fun. Music is amazing. Video games can provide near infinite entertainment. There are a lot of cool things to spend your time on that are cheap per hour of entertainment provided (and aren't $10 drinks at the bar). Even if you love the bars, you can go to most bars with your friends for free. Be the designated driver. Drink at home and walk/lyft out to the bars with your friends (once COVID is under control, of course). It's not that big of a deal to plan a bit.
4. **Invest and Invest EARLY!** The first money I earned and paid taxes on at an internship went into a Roth IRA immediately. I maxed all my retirement accounts in year 1 of my first real job and didn't increase my lifestyle nearly at all except for social obligations with new coworkers (and even then, I found the cheapest way to do everything while still pulling my weight). Despite the fact it now looks like I am some Tesla/Crypto dude, I started out with basically ALL broad based index funds for *years*. My cost basis in real estate/index funds is probably $400,000-$500,000 while my cost basis in individual stocks/crypto is probably $40,000 after 10 years.
5. **Find hobbies that make you money!** I love looking at real estate. My spouse and I bought a property and rented out extra rooms. We made some money on rent, we made some money on appreciation. We have had quite a few small headaches and inconveniences but it still has been an adventure, and a profitable one! Plus we have learned a lot.
6. **Set a goal, give yourself a reasonable reward!** You don't have to spend nothing. I just try not to waste anything. Over time, dogs are expensive. I wanted a dog anyways. Once I had a steady job and a positive performance review under my belt, I adopted a dog! Worth every penny. After 8 years, I upgraded my reliable used car to my first new car - I just plan to keep it for 15 years and take care of it.

**TL;DR: Went to a state school and utilized whatever combination of resources I could to graduate college without debt. Found a reasonably lucrative job and supportive, frugal spouse. Lived cheaply/""house hacked"" and enjoyed people/animals/cheap hobbies. Invested as much and as early as possible in broad based mutual funds. YOLOed a few bucks on crypto and tech stocks and held on for dear life (got lucky and had it grow a lot). Overall, saved over $1M in the 10 years since college and became a walking FIRE stereotype.**

OH WAIT. I forgot. Am I fucking myself yet? I mean... Am I going to go fuck myself? Not yet! With a combined net worth of \~$1.6M, my spouse and I consider ourselves generally financially independent (as of the last couple months) but I like my job and want plenty of buffer since a large part of our net worth is in extremely volatile investments. We have been lucky because during the pandemic we have stayed healthy and been able to work from home, which has been a nice change of pace for us. My spouse is currently pregnant so she is going to quit first! We are going to see how she feels after maternity leave but she basically is welcome to leave her job whenever she feels ready (she has worked her ASS off). I will likely follow when I no longer enjoy my work or we have hit a combined NW in the early $2 million range. I hope to FIRE by age 35 with at least a $70,000 a year budget (3.5% withdrawal rate) in the suburbs. Thank you for all the advice over the years and for reading my long post!",54,financialindependence

Our net worth recently reached a major landmark and it seemed like a good time to start. We decided at each $10k milestone we would buy a bottle of wine to enjoy in celebration. We would then write the date and wealth milestone number on the cork, and drop it in a large glass jug we found at Target. We are keeping the jug on our bedroom dresser, and it actually looks pretty great. We decided to write the wealth number in roman numerals to subtly avoid questions in case anyone takes a good look at the corks. I've linked a couple pictures of our set-up below.

[https://imgur.com/a/PJLX3JG](https://imgur.com/a/PJLX3JG)

I think this tradition will work well for us. The bottle of wine, and the satisfaction of dropping another cork in the jug, acts as a carrot on a string.

Happy savings, and happy thanksgiving!

For clarification, these $10k milemarkers will certainly have to change as our portfolio grows. For now, this seems like the right amount for us given where we’re at. Also, we’re using a “high watermark” approach where we won’t celebrate the same milestone twice, but only those which are new all time highs.",115,financialindependence

241,When life compels you to dampen the flames of FIRE,,437,jzi8uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jzi8uk/when_life_compels_you_to_dampen_the_flames_of_fire/,1606140579.0,"I suppose most people have had a strange year in 2020, but for me it has been particularly odd.  I've been actively chasing FIRE with my partner for the last ~5 years, and expected to be working on it for another 5-10 years (but said too much on my main, so here's a burner!)


Part of that plan was always to have one or two children, and I knew that would present a challenge - after all, they're not cheap, even if you're frugal, and although we could potentially both achieve pay rises to balance out the effects, it was a massive unknown.  That was a driver for RE, though, so that I could be actively involved in their lives.


In the event it has taken quite a different turn.  My daughter was born in March, and has been quite unwell ever since her birth.  To cut a long story short, her condition is very poorly understood (because it is so unbelievably rare), but the world-leading expert who is now responsible for her care believes that it can only improve - and potentially the point that no-one would know she was ill.  How long that may take is anyone's guess, but we're probably talking about a few years.


Concurrently, my employer has been quite flexible, and they gave me 6 months off to deal with the immediate aftermath.  In October they agreed to give me another 6 months off, although this time at 50% rather than 100% of pay, which I immediately accepted.  I don't know right now if I'll be able to go back at the end of that, but I also don't feel like I care that much.  If we have to scrape by for a year and delay FIRE, and then get a different job down the line that pays lower and delay FIRE a bit more, I'm suddenly much more open to that than I would have been a year ago.


It has been an interesting journey for me both logically and emotionally, and although I imagine that many people would throw FIRE to the wayside because it isn't integrally important to the problem, for me it feels just as critical as ever.  I don't think I'm at the end of this thinking process, but wanted to share some lessons that I feel I've learned and see what thoughts or experiences others might have.


* 1 - Knowing *why* you want to FIRE (and *if* you genuinely want to RE) might not matter when you're starting out, but when problems hit, suddenly it really does.  For me, one of the main reasons to FIRE is to look after my child(ren).  Admittedly, I'd envisaged cheering them on at soccer practice rather than staring at a bunch of medical equipment at 3am in the morning, but that doesn't matter.

* 2 - FIRE is not a rod for your back.  Yes, MMM might shout at you because you ordered a takeaway pizza, but he isn't going to be standing at the pearly gates with some accounting software before condemning you to a pit of angry bear markets.  It is simply an extension of trading time for money.  When life kicks you in the balls, it's OK to buy some ointment.  In this case, my high SR allows me to take a temporary salary drop that might mean skipping mortgage payments for other people.  Or to consider throwing more money at daycare once COVID gets bored and leaves us alone.

* 3 - Even if FIRE can give you enough money to cope with every black swan you've envisaged, there are some things money can't buy.  If I'd tried to work through this, I would genuinely have lost my mind.  And I probably would have compromised my daughter's health, my partner's health, and our marriage.  If I'd refused to pay for a halfway decent hotel near the hospital I wouldn't have been to help my partner through the hardest days.  So if VTSAX has to wait, wait it must.

* 4 - Luck is important, but you can push the odds in your favour.  I can't deny that my employer has been great, but I joined them because I knew we were going to have an family, and my old employer treated anything outside of work as a major drag.  I switched company for no pay rise because I knew the new place were far better - and so it has proved to be.  The old place would not have paid me, and certainly would have invited me to resign by now.  Family and friends have been amazing, but as my therapist pointed out I've bent over backwards for them in the past.  Our neighbours have been wonderful, but partly because we moved to a different part of town with lots of families and young children so that we'd fit in better.  All my daughter's care (I dread to think what the dollar cost might have been) has been fully paid by the state, but equally I chose not to go abroad for big salaries and low taxes where that wouldn't have been guaranteed.  So we've benefited from these things, but not by total chance.


I'm in no doubt that the next few years are going to be rough.  I might go back to my job and get a promotion.  I might coast.  I might quit and do something else.  My partner might quit.  We might spend a lot of money on daycare.  We might need to move to a different area.  Am I comfortable with how my FIRE plans have been altered?  No, honestly I'm not.  I want more than ever to know that I'll never spend another week working in the middle of nowhere on some pointless project, or sat with my laptop in the sun on a Saturday afternoon writing a report no-one will read.  And I have probably pushed that date back to a degree.  But at the same time I'm having to appreciate that the journey is just as important as the destination.  Hopefully in a year or so things will be much clearer, but I'm not quite there yet.",77,financialindependence

But I am unsure if I am able to make the argument on behalf of (most of us) to follow this living-within-means, invest, and retire ""well"" argument. Im sure my knowledge is flawed here, but I can't figure out what Im missing in defending FIR (exclude E)

I live in Miami. We have lots of ""50 K millionaires"". In the sense people in Miami believe in putting every ounce they have into cars, clothes, accessories, electronics, and houses (where almost all of these are depreciating assets), even if they can barely afford the monthly payment.

When it comes to your average FIRE, saving and investing is a big deal. The catch I see is, you live your prime years (20-50) saving, only to live your ""so called golden years"" paying for healthcare, your housing, and probably your nursing home.

**Argument:**

My spend-it-all neighbors argue that, ""if youre making 50,60,70 grand/annually (2x)- blow it on the luxuries now- because life sucks when youre old anyway."" When I make the argument that you wont have anything to rely on when youre older- the counter from them is that medicare/Medicaid social security will find them a nursing home, cover their healthcare, etc costs if they are broke.

**IS this true?**

**And if so, where does the middle class worker who maxed out his 401 K since he graduated college and lived life in moderation win?**

My father was disabled at 55 due to a stroke, and as a guy who lived in moderation, I found that (had he lived longer than just months post stroke)- he would receive 0 government assistance, 0 aid, and pay full price for every ounce of life support he needed (healthcare insurance, nursing homes, etc ).

Meanwhile, girlfriend's mother never worked past 30, has had a foreclosure and a bankruptcy. When she did work she made minimum wage, and some how at 60 she is ""Retired"" and collecting 1300 in social security.

**Is this saving, investing worth it when other people can just use the system in place?**

I don't have to worry, take out lines of credit, or stress over unexpected expenses. Although I am nowhere near complete financial independence, the building blocks and foundational strategies allow me to live stress free in my day to day life.

252,Turned 29 and hit LeanFIRE! I feel no differently than I did when I had nothing. I also suffer from financial anxiety. Here's my story.,,736,jx2ybx,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jx2ybx/turned_29_and_hit_leanfire_i_feel_no_differently/,1605793609.0,"**)** 

&#x200B;

All amounts are in USD, for just myself.

For me, 500k is basically LeanFIRE. I could return to the city I used to live in and spend 18-20k a year and be perfectly content. I hit 500k recently with the recent boom in the market. I won’t RE right now, but theoretically I should feel some kind of relief at this point because I am leanFIRE, but I don’t really.

Started working January 2015

2015 – 70k income, 24k expenses

2016 – 100k income, 19k expenses

2017 – 140k income, 17.5k expenses

2018 – 145k income – 18k expenses

2019 – 200k income – 40k expenses -> I moved to VVHCOL city here

2020 – 250k income – 40k expenses

Expected 2021 – 250k income – 36k expenses

Most of my compensation is base salary. A small portion is cash bonus. No stocks.

**Financial Anxiety**

You’d think I would feel better/relaxed now, but I don’t. You’ll notice a common theme in this post, and that’s anxiety. I have anxiety over spending money, saving money, investments, you name it.

It’s affected my relationships a lot. At times I have been overly controlling even about my partners financial habits. Pre-covid I was seeing a therapist to help deal with this anxiety, and it has actually helped a lot to improve my personal relationships, because now I can at least recognize and feel/touch the anxiety. Before it was just hidden, unknown emotions that I couldn’t place a trigger on. I never thought of myself as an anxious person until therapy. I am outgoing, well-spoken, have no social anxiety, and don’t get anxious about presentations or speaking engagements. I do get anxious though when I splurge on a single purchase because it feels like I’m slipping into lifestyle inflation and my whole world is falling apart. I do get anxious when my partner purchases a single splurge item because I extrapolate it to the extreme - to them having given up on FIRE, and therefore we are incompatible and should break up because ‘clearly FIRE isn’t important to them’. I do get anxious when my partner didn’t want to implement auto deposits every month, because they preferred every 1-2 months just going and manually doing it. To me that just felt like it was so easy to just let everything slip and fall out of control. But they had a method and it works. At the end of the day, our annual spending is very close and I really have no reason to complain or comment on anything that my partner does money wise.

Sounds crazy when you write it out, and I’ve improved a lot in this regard. Therapy has helped. My partner bought a $300 splurge item recently and I barely commented on it. My partner doesn’t do automatic deposits to investments every paycheck and it doesn’t bother me at all anymore. Therapy helped me understand that these were not rational reactions and I was actually reacting to the feeling of ‘losing control’ and ‘things just slipping’. I still often feel the financial anxiety, but the difference is that I understand the emotion for what it is – a mental illness. I can control my reactions, even if I sometimes can’t control my feelings. Before I didn’t realize it was anxiety, I thought my viewpoints were totally justified.

Hell, I even bought a PS5 recently for $500 and it didn’t bother me that much! I’m thankful to now understand how annoyed I would be if my partner made a huge deal every time I wanted to buy something like this. We are all adults and as long as our annual spending is reasonably in line with our goals we are fine.

So hitting LeanFIRE hasn’t really done much for me either. It doesn’t feel real at all. I’m still working and slaving away. I keep trying to tell myself that I don’t ‘need’ to work, but it doesn’t feel like that. I’m not sure if this is because I know in RE I won’t follow 4% rule, likely 3%, or if I will started to feel relaxed as I gain more NW. I basically feel the same as when I was 0 NW. It might also because I feel battered and exhausted from work. If anything, I feel more like a battered, nervous wreck than I was when I was at $0 NW. Back then I felt like I had energy, and enthusiasm, and wanted to take on the world of work. Now I just want to quit. **I shouldn't feel anxiety, but I do**. To be frank I'm extremely lucky and privileged, but sometimes it just doesn't matter. Rationally I know I am very lucky and in a fantastic position. Emotionally it doesn't feel like that.

**RE plans**

I plan to work for another 5-6 or so years, but that may vary depending on a few factors. My job right now causes me a lot of anxiety. The hours are not too bad, but the pressure is high, there is often conflict, tensions are very high, and I am judged on the basis of my decision making. If I make poor decisions it affects the whole business, and I am solely responsible for making a lot of decisions. I basically hope to hold on as long as I can. Every year I am adding 130k to my investment portfolio, with an after-tax savings rate of more than 75% (I pay a LOT of taxes), so I understand the value in trying to just keep working a little bit longer. I think my goal RE number is about 1.5M, which by normal projections I would hit by 2025/2026. I also have a partner who is on the same path but a little bit younger and so is a little bit behind me. Having more cushion in my number will help my partner’s situation as well and make them feel more comfortable about RE.

I might not make it 5-6 years. I don’t know. The last 2 years have been really hard. I’m just trying to hold on as long as I can because my income is high relative to my NW. On the flip side, I might work 10 more. Trying to be flexible.

My reasons for wanting to retire are multifold

1. My job affects my mental health a lot. I just feel so much better when I’m on vacation and away from the office and away from the work stress. I’m a much happier person, my partner notices it too and says I’m a much happier person to be around when I’m away from work. This has only gotten worse as I’ve moved up in roles. When I first started my career it wasn’t so bad. Now it even affects my sleep. WFH doesn’t help this either, it actually makes it worse. It’s not the hours, it’s the pressure to succeed and the stress. I actually enjoy my work when it is lower stress periods – although not enough to spend 40 hours a week doing it. I don’t like being forced to do anything. I would consider to voluntarily work 15 hours a week even if it was unpaid, but roles like that don’t really exist for me. I don’t have enough work experience to become an independent consultant just yet, but that might be something I do down the road.
2. I want to see the world and live abroad. When I retire I will definitely move around. Having financial cushion to be flexible there helps. I don’t know for how long, or where, but FIRE gives me maximum flexibility.
3. I have a lot of hobbies and other ways to spend my time. I could sit at home for 3 months straight and not be bored. That’s not how I plan on spending retirement, but I have lots of things I want to do with my free time instead of working.
4. I probably thinking about retiring every single day. I’m actively trying to not do this, after this post and responding to comments, I won’t be coming back to this sub often. I just need to get away and focus on things outside of work to try and be happy in my day to day life.

I want to work longer and not RE yet because

1. I want more cushion because of my financial anxiety
2. I might want to spend more down the road
3. I’d be nervous about my ability to re-enter the workforce if I left and the market doesn’t do well
4. My income to networth ratio leads itself to saying I should push through as long as I can. If I was only making 30k a year with this stress, good chance I’d just quit and/or work part-time on something relaxing.
5. I have a hard time because I feel like I've struck a golden lotto ticket. Billions of people would kill to be in my shoes and I just feel like a big whiny pants sometimes. Why would I quit when I have such a nice income and reasonable hours?

I don’t want kids and neither does my partner.

**Income**

My income has gone up a lot, and I’ve taken a different route than most people who have income jumps like this. I’ve stayed at the exact same company who has treated me well. I’ve worked hard and been promoted fast. I’ve negotiated comp three times, but not that hard. My comp might be 10k less if I hadn’t. I also compare my compensation to people at my level in the company, and I am similarly paid to them. I’ve also spoken to external recruiters, and I’m being paid fairly. I think the notion that you need to change jobs every 3 years to maximize comp isn’t true 100% the time. If you spend the time to negotiate, compare to your peers, and have a company who treats you right financially, there isn’t a need to move around. Every company is different. Some companies you may need to hop around because they will treat you poorly financially if you are there too long. I’ve worked on 3 different teams in the same company. Also, in 2019 I moved to a VVHCOL city, and my income jumped as a result. I knew the \~250k role was coming in 2020, so that’s why the expense increase was worth it. My savings rate went down, but my total savings $ went up, and I won’t retire to VVHCOL city.

I won’t be sharing my industry or my location or any other information.

**Expenses**

I discovered FIRE midway through 2015 and started being more conscious of expenses then. I also had a few extra expenses such as some student debt to pay off in 2015. I was always frugal, but became a lot more focused once I figured out I could retire early. The biggest thing I changed after discovering FIRE was just cooking more.

I didn’t go to school in the US so my education was significantly cheaper. I graduated with only a few thousand dollars of debt. My parents contributed about $8000 to my education, the rest was self-funded. Worked in high school, had internships in college, etc.

Now my expenses are high, but of the 40k total expenses, over 2k of that is my share of the rent. I share a 1-bedroom apartment with my partner. I live in a very expensive city, but I could easily drop my expenses back down to the \~20k level by moving.

**Investments**

I’m roughly 50/50 VTI and VXUS. I believe in global diversification. The US has done very well lately, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will continue to do well in the future. My investment strategy is basically to mimic the ETF VT. If US becomes a larger proportion of the global stock market, so will my portfolio. Basically what I am saying is that I don’t rebalance. I purchase ETFs every paycheck, and my strategy is just to buy to get myself closer to the VT proportion. VT is around 50/50 now, so I almost just alternate every paycheck buying VTI and VXUS. I don’t need to do anything large because as my ETFs move up and down in value, they are automatically moving towards my goal asset allocation, because my goal is a moving target. As well, my post-FIRE plans lead well to holding high amounts of VXUS as I want to have larger exposure to different currencies.

I didn’t change anything during the brief covid recession. Just kept plugging along.

Real estate is too much work for me. I don’t want to be a landlord. I don’t own the home I live in because I want to move often and 5 years isn’t enough for it to be worthwhile.

**Other ideas**

I’ve toyed with just moving abroad now, and quitting my job and accepting a lower paycheck. That might happen if someday I just can’t hold on any longer. It would be hard for me to take a lower paycheck at this time, maybe if I had a larger NW. I love where I live but I also want to see the world and live abroad.

I’ve toyed with finding a different job that is lower stress, but I’m not sure it exists at this compensation range in my profession. I also enjoy that my hours are reasonable at my job. Sometimes I miss the days of 2015 where I made 70k a year and had no real responsibility. I worked slightly more hours back then, but I wasn’t the one who was ultimately responsible, and my work stress was significantly less. But I’d rather work 5 more years at 250k than 15 more at 70k.

I don’t have a networth tracker. Sorry! I have no idea. They’d be guesses.

**Summary**

That’s it. Feel free to AMA. I was a little bit afraid to make this post because I didn't want to just be another ""High income earner reaching FIRE at a young age"" post, but I think the other aspects of my situation hopefully make things more interesting. I definitely recognize rationally that I've had a fortunate upbringing and am lucky to be here.

FIRE can't control your life. Easier said than done, but I know what I need to do. I need to do things to make my daily life happier, stop daydreaming about retirement, and just be happy. I will only have my 30s once.

Also - therapy is amazing. If you tried it before and didn't like it, try it again with a different therapist! Took me 3 or 4 to find one that clicked.",489,financialindependence

I was the youngest kid, and I remember being 12 years old when I got my first pair of shoes that were my very own new shoes, not hand me downs.

When I was in college on a scholarship, she finally graduated from high school by studying for and passing her GED. She got a job at the county as a clerk, which was the first stable job she ever had.

Two years after I got my Ph.D., I had a brand new townhouse built for her. She got to pick out the granite for the countertops and the fixtures for the bathrooms and the wall color.

When I sold that place later, I lost money, but honestly, fuck money when it comes down to it. It was the nicest place she ever lived in.",241,financialindependence

260,Firecalc observation on taking pension and SS early vs late,,304,jvrwdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jvrwdq/firecalc_observation_on_taking_pension_and_ss/,1605614897.0,"At these advice of some other posters here I have been running scenarios in [firecalc.com](https://firecalc.com). It is really a great tool as it allows you to put in nearly all of your financial data (portfolio balances and composition, when to start retirement and how long, income needed, pensions, SS, future contributions and windfalls, etc.) and figure out historically if your situation would be successful based on all of the starting years for which they have data.

In my situation, my retirement will be funded by a combination of 401k/457b, pensions, SS, and a windfall I expect when selling my house before moving abroad. I am toying with the idea of retiring in 3 1/2 years at age 55 so I wanted to see what income I could generate.

Without boring you with the details I looked at the differences in withholding my pension from age 55 to 63 (thereby increasing it from less than $13k to more than $26k) and withholding SS from age 62 to 70 (thereby increasing it from less than $25k to more than $43k). Much to my surprise holding out those 8 years to nearly double my income resulted in a less successful retirement by every metric that firecalc shows. I ran the scenarios with a starting income of $84k running to age 90 with CPI increases to see how it worked out. The results show the early payouts (55 and 62) vs waiting (63 and 70):

Odds of success: 92.7% vs 85.4%

Average money left at the end: $8.2M vs $7.3M

High money left at end: $19.3M vs $19.2M

Low money left at end: $-1.9M vs $-3.9M

Worst case minimum number of years before being broke: 22 vs 14

I also figured out what the maximum amount of money to spend each year at historical 100% success and the early pensions/SS won there as well at $78k vs $72k.

The only situation where the late payments works out better is if I hit the worst case scenario and exhaust all of my 401k/457b. The worst historical year would put me at 14 years (age 69) so I could still end up with my pension (more than $26k, only slightly inflation adjusted) and SS at $43k (or about $40k if I had to start at age 69). I would also have another pension that would also pay out about $13k (not inflation adjusted) leaving me with about $79k decreasing effective value annually as my pensions won't keep up with inflation. Whereas if I took the more historically effective route of early payout from my pension and SS, and I still crapped out 22 years later at age 77, I would only have less than $25k (SS) + $13k (pension 1) + $13k (pension 2) = less than $51k, also losing value from inflation. It would be a lot tougher to live on that $51k than $79k if the need arose, although like I said there has never been a scenario where the early withdrawal plan didn't succeed in giving me $78k (inflation adjusted).",129,financialindependence

I don't talk about my finances with folks IRL so oftentimes I feel like I am just winging it alone and hoping for the best. While I don't necessarily think the internet is the spot to get all my financial advice, this is a small attempt to get outside my own head for feedback, support, and constructive criticism. With that being said, lets start this FIRE journey!

&#x200B;

**Backstory**

I was born in (and live in) the US, and was fortunate to grow up in a home where we lived well within our means. I learned great savings and money management principals from my father, and was able to go to high school and college with scholarship + family money. This allowed me to work part time (I had a number of successful internships, and personal businesses) and put all of my own money towards personal expenses (cars, computers, etc.), travel/luxuries, and most importantly savings. Fast forward to 2019 and I am able to graduate with a well paying job, no debt, and a small pile of cash. Now that I am looking more seriously at the reason I am saving money, I figured I need to have actual goals and processes in place rather than just stowing away what ""feels right."" FIRE seems like a great goal to have, and even if life changes along the way I won't regret being closer to that security.

I will break down my budget later and there may be a line item that a lot of people don't have -- especially given the time value of money. As a Christian I believe in generous giving & tithing so you will see a significant portion of income dedicated to that end. While I must admit that at times I even find myself thinking ""what if for just this month I allocated that elsewhere...."" this is something that is a part of my life and always will be. It comes off the top out of joy.

**Allocations**

Brokerage: **51k** \- Equity investments. Keeps me up at night sometimes.

RoboRoth: **12k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Roth401k: **20k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Emergency: **10k** \- Roboinvesting with super low risk tolerance (2-3 / 10)

**Monthly** **Budget**

Taxes: **29%** \- ouch

Giving: **12%**  \- see backstory

Rent: **12%** \- expensive location with multiple roommates

Discretionary: **6%** \- hobbies, travel, etc.

Roth401k: **7%** \- company match 4% - I just moved this up to 14% after building my emergency savings and expecting to lose part of my RothIRA eligibility soon.

RothIRA: **6%** \- Always maxed, however I expect to have to reverse after EoY bonuses.

General Savings: **22%** \- minimum 2k/mo, any leftovers from living & discretionary go here.

&#x200B;

**Kindling the Flames**

It is likely that there is an EoY bonus around the corner but I have no clue what sized -- I would conservatively guess 10k and optimistically guess 20k. I am known to be a bad guesser though and am not going to scoff at 5k either. Hopefully I can skirt by without having to reverse any of my RothIRA contribs but I think at least a portion of these will have to get touched. My plan is to dump this straight to savings.

Having now learned about FIRE concepts I decided that I want to start putting my time, energy, and finances towards this goal. I am not going to be a masochist about it, and absolutely want to maintain a quality of life, but I also want to find better ways to utilize my income to support this. The goal for me isn't retirement for retirement sake, but rather to get to a position where I could take passion jobs without worrying about the income, go take time to serve in other communities/countries, dedicate my time and energy to family or other causes, etc.

I think there is plenty of room for growth and improvement in how I am operating things so I am open to any and all feedback, thoughts, speculations. I know I may have to swallow some pride in the name of wiser investment choices. If anything this may serve as a fun story for myself to look back on as it develops.",22,financialindependence

263,First Fire Update - 100K at 25 - 2 year Journey (Also US expat in UK),,417,jv7ugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jv7ugd/first_fire_update_100k_at_25_2_year_journey_also/,1605537699.0,"Hi everyone!
I wanted to post my first FIRE entry after hitting 100k last week.

Retirement Net Worth: **103K**

* 401K: **56K**
* Roth IRA (FNCMX): **18K**
* Index Fund (SWPPX): **29K**
* I have a savings account/emergency fund but it's under 10K.

My current goal is 200K by end of 2022. I think my current FIRE number is $2M and would love to retire before 50.

2017: Graduated University of Virginia with an Economics degree. Feel free to throw an asterisk on my story because I graduated without student loans since my parents were able to save for my higher education. I also lived at home in NY from 2017-2019 until I moved to the UK.

* Sept 2017: **55K** - Starting Salary. Bonus range 0-10%, N/A first year.
* March 2019: **63K** - Raise
* November 2020: **76K** - Raise

I won't go into my whole life journey, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments. July 2019 I moved from the US to the UK team of my company on a Tier 2 Intra Company Visa. I can't say I completely understand my pay structure, but I had my company keep me on both payrolls so I could contribute to our 401K. I pay Social Security and Medicare, and Income Tax (UK), everything else is exempt and paid (if needed) EOY during tax season which I already used a tax firm for. 

Here is my breakdown of my 83K salary (76K+7K Bonus)

* Taxes: 13K (16%)
* Rent & Utilities: 23K (28%)
* Savings: 40.5K (**49%** savings rate) -401K: 19.5K at a 26% contribution -IRA: 6K -Index Funds: 15K (usually at $1,300 a month)
* Spending: Remaining 6.5K (8%)

I only was eligible to start contributing to my 401K after 1 year at my company, so that's when I started saving. I learned about FIRE about a 8 months ago. I'm currently just enjoying my time in London for the next 2 years on my visa. I don't expect any further big pay raises beyond yearly inflation adjustments because I'm now at the top of my Client Associate/Data Analyst ladder. Honestly I like the UK so much, I dread the idea of paying into a HSA or 529 plan because its free over here... (crossing my fingers things work out with my UK girlfriend haha)

I also work on a small Belt start up with friends but that's more a money sink!

I check WSB on the reg to remind myself that This Is The Way.

264,Some tips to young people in this sub from a 26 y/o who has been on the journey for 5 years.,,2139,jupyqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jupyqj/some_tips_to_young_people_in_this_sub_from_a_26/,1605462566.0,"It seems like there are a decent amount of younger people on here (College/High School Age) more and more which is great! As a 26 y/o who has been on the path for 5 years now I wanted to provide some tips for younger people as they begin this journey. I don't have the experience of people who have FIRE'd per se, but I think I can help explain what worked for me. 

1. Learns the basics

Personal finance and investing is an awesome thing to get into because you can dig as deep into it as you want or stay at the surface level. There is a reason why some of the smartest investing minds in the world (Warren Buffett) read for hours on end. The finance world evolves, markets change, and the way people behave with money moves around. With that being said, you need to learn the basics. What are the basics?

“Spend less than you make, invest the difference”

Spend – Create a budget. Fixed expenses and then fun money. 

Make – Get a job that allows you to save a little bit of cash

Invest – Dollar Cost Average, 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage account, withdrawal rates. 

It will be easy to go down a rabbit hole when reading about personal finance to the point where it might even intimidate you. Learn the basics and get started. There are plenty of free online resources that will help you understand best practices like which % of your budget towards certain items and how to invest. You have some time to iron out the details. The worst thing you can do is not start. 

2. Keep it simple: Index Funds

Index funds. Index Funds. Index Funds. 

I don’t know how else to say this but I would recommend you start off with index funds. I know it isn’t what /r/stocks or /r/wallstreetbets is going to tell you but index funds will allow you to get a piece of the pie without the risk of individual stocks. The worst thing that could happen to you is you throw a grand in a stock based on a tip on Reddit and you get wiped out to the point where you don’t even want to invest in the market anymore. 

Hey competitiveduck, that is great but how do I avoid the FOMO of all these tech gains?

Understand that cycles happen. “Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered”. Look into the top 10 companies by market cap for each decade. Companies come and go. I am not anti-stock at all. I recommend that people play around with stocks to avoid FOMO but only once they have enough in index funds to where compound interest takes over. I didn’t buy a single share of stock until I had >100k invested in index funds and even now it is a small % of my larger portfolio.

3. Get the money

Get the money. You have to be selfish in your career at this point when your expenses are fairly low and you don’t have the responsibilities of a family. Change cities, change jobs, change companies. Get money. If you are all about starting a low-level job in a company with the idea that in 30 years you might be the CEO great, but there is only 1 CEO job for a reason. Maximize earnings in your 20s as much as you can, invest, and wait. If you don’t believe me, look up videos or pictures of what happens at 65 based on when you start investing. The difference in net worth is staggering. Get money. 

4. It easiest to compare yourself to others post-college

I’m not sure there will ever be a time in your life where it is easiest to feel bad about yourself than right after college. You go from everybody playing the same game in college to now everybody is in separate leagues and playing a different sport. You have a friend in law school in debt up to their ass, you have a friend crushing it at Google, you have a friend struggling to figure things out and there might be you just hoping to get enough money for guac at Chipotle. Understand that you don’t need to be anywhere else than where YOU think you need to be. Life tends to even itself out. 

“Comparison is the thief of joy”

5. Keep in touch with friends and take care of your body 

To echo on the last point, good friends are hard to come by the older you get. Try and keep in touch with them as much as possible and plan trips to see them. Some of my best friends still are my college friends. Use them as a base but don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and explore new people. 

In regard to staying in shape, there is no sense in retiring early if your body isn’t able to do things you want to do. Plain and simple. 

6. Do what works for you, not what works in a spreadsheet

You are going to hear about all the ways you can tinker with your investments or take on debt and theoretically it works in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets aren’t rooted in reality. Some of these include how it is easier to put less than 20% down on a house because interest rates are so low and invest the difference, or how you should invest 80% of your paycheck to tap into investing. Morgan Housel has a way of investing and I think it is great in that you should invest in a way that “helps you sleep at night” and in a way that you can do it consistently for decades. Do what works for you. 

7. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme

Understand the game that you are playing. Investing Twitter and TV networks react to daily moves in the market. You aren’t in it for the short term, you are in it for the long term. If you are in your early 20’s you probably have a 30-40-year time horizon. Think of all the crazy world events that have happened in the last 30-40 years alone. COVID, 08 Financial Crisis, Iraq War, 9/11, Dot Com Crash, and then the 1987 Market Crash. All of those “world is ending” type events have led to a 9.42% average return before inflation. To tap into the power of compound interest you need to stay in the market for a long period of time.

“Interrupting a favorable power law is the worst mistake you can make as an investor.” – Naval

8. Read the top posts on this subreddit but be aware of survivorship bias 

The fact that you are in this subreddit is a great start. Use the resources in the wiki to learn about investment options and what works for other people. Learn about people who have achieved FIRE and how they got there. Most of the time it is a bumpy road with kids, large one-off expenses, buying a house, changing careers, etc. Like the stock market, it is rarely a smooth ride. However, there is a lot of survivorship bias in here about people who have achieved FIRE. For every person who has achieved it, there are probably 10 who have given up, ruined a relationship, or became miserable due to extreme saving. Please understand that this is a grind and if you aren’t happy now with the hopes of being happy 30 years ago, I’d advise you to take a step back and read the below post. It is essential reading.

265,Taking a closer look at investment returns.,,3,jvfjbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jvfjbq/taking_a_closer_look_at_investment_returns/,1605561886.0,"A few months ago, someone on this sub made a post asking why people on FI journeys don’t spend more time discussing their investments. I can’t find it anymore, but I recall that the general consensus was that since we can’t predict how the stock market will perform, there isn’t much to discuss, and those on the FI path would be better served spending that time on things they can control like increasing their income and decreasing spending. While I do agree that the market is out of any one person’s control, I think it *is* prudent to spend a considerable amount of time optimizing our portfolios given that a good chunk of FI/RE is usually achieved by means of investments. 

It seems to me that the argument for a globally diversified portfolio is that there are times when the US outperforms the world and times when the world outperforms the US, and that there are too many unknowns to make an accurate prediction, so it is best to just buy a slice of everything. The underlying assumption is that there is an *equal chance* that any one group of stocks will outperform the rest, which is why we are supposed to buy a global market-weighted ETF like $VT. I think this idea is a bit flawed and unfair to historically well-performing subclasses of stocks.

Hypothetically speaking, let’s say that the NASDAQ-100 ($QQQ) has a 50/50 chance of having a repeat of the last decade (19.04%) or go to zero dollars, with nothing in between, vs. a 100% chance that $VT will repeat its last 10 years in performance (8.06%). Assuming you have the risk tolerance to accommodate both, which would you choose?

A $10,000 in $QQQ in November of 2010 would have yielded $57,137 by the end of October 2020 and $21,713 for $VT. $QQQ returned over **4x** as much in nominal dollar returns. So, the expected value of our hypothetical is:

$QQQ: (0.5* $47,137 + 0.5* -$10,000) = $18,569.

$VT: (1.0 * $11,713) = $11,713. 

As you can see, the expected value of $QQQ is STILL vastly higher even when considering a 50% chance of the NASDAQ-100 going to zero in ten years time. Not just 0% returns, but actually declining all the way down to zero. In fact, in this two outcome experiment, you would only need a 38% chance of a repeat on the $QQQ and a **62%** chance of going to zero to trump a *guaranteed* 8.06% return on $VT from a purely mathematical perspective.

This wouldn’t be an issue if all indexes both in the US and around the world returned roughly the same amount, but they don’t, there is a large gap between well-performing American indexes like the NASDAQ-100 and the global average that only seems to be getting bigger as larger returns compound over time. 

There is a large opportunity cost that comes with safety in being well-diversified that many I feel are not fully taking into consideration. Yes, past results doesn’t guarantee future returns, yes, you can’t predict the stock market, but does that mean that I should simply default to a globally diversified portfolio? In my opinion, if your risk tolerance can accommodate both, it makes sense to take a calculated risk because the reward could be so great. 

In a more realistic example, suppose that I think there is a 25% chance that the NASDAQ returns 4% in the next 10 years (less than a quarter what is was in the decade prior), 50% chance of a 10% return and a 25% chance of a 15% return, again, well below the last 10 years. I would consider this to be a pessimistic outlook. Compare that to a 25% chance of $VT repeating 8% and a 75% chance of outperforming the last decade, a 10% return. 

$QQQ:  (0.25 * $4,802 + 0.5 * $15,937 + 0.25 + $30,456) = $16,783
$VT: (0.25 * $11,589 + 0.75 * $15,937) = $14,850


It’s still not even close. My point is that the NASDAQ-100 would have to fall *really* far to justify holding a globally-diversified ETF, and even a small chance of a repeat is enough to warrant taking that risk. I think it is important to do these calculations for your own portfolio rather than simply shutting off our brains and assuming that all outcomes have the same probability in light of past performance. Again, this *only* applies when your risk tolerance is not a factor.

267,At the request of a couple commenters.. Opportunity Zones explained,,39,jv1cz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jv1cz3/at_the_request_of_a_couple_commenters_opportunity/,1605504722.0,"Two posters asked that I explain opportunity zones today and said I should post on it, so here goes... TL/DR investing in opportunity zones defers and offsets capital gains taxes

&#x200B;

**What is the** **Opportunity** **Zone** **Program?**  


As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), Congress created the Qualified Opportunity Zones (""QOZ"") program to encourage development in economically distressed communities across the country designated as Opportunity Zones by the various state and federal authorities.    
**What is an** **Opportunity** **Zone?**  
Opportunity Zones are census tracts designated by state and federal governments targeted for economic development.

**How Does the Program Work?**To encourage private investment, the Treasury, acting through the IRS, provides potentially massive tax benefits for investors who invest in Opportunity Zones through a Qualified Opportunity Fund (""Opportunity Fund"").    


A Qualified Opportunity Fund is a private partnership or corporation organized for the purpose of investing in a Qualified Opportunity Zone business or real estate development.    
**What are the Tax Benefits?**  
The biggest draw offered to investors is the chance to defer taxes on recent or potential capital gains from appreciated assets such as real estate or stocks until December 31, 2026.  
By investing in an Opportunity Fund, an investor can:  


* Defer taxes on the original capital gain until the end of 2026.
* Reduce up to 15% of the tax bill on the original capital gains if remain invested in the Fund for at least 7 years.
* Completely eliminate the tax on any appreciation (new capital gains) on the original investment after the 10-year mark in the Opportunity Fund.

The QOZ program is designed to encourage long-term investments.  The longer an investor leaves their capital gains in an Opportunity Fund, the greater the tax savings.  
Here is a summary of the long-term benefits:

The Qualified Opportunity Zones program is a tremendous [opportunity sitting on capital gains to re-invest those gains in an Opportunity Fund to reap massive tax benefits and potential profits.    


At the same time, they would be helping economic development in the neediest neighborhoods across the country by developing businesses and real estate in those communities and, in turn, providing valuable jobs for eager residents. It's a true win-win for everyone involved.",29,financialindependence

270,Savings Rate as a Function of Wealth to Reach FIRE,,330,jufo6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jufo6u/savings_rate_as_a_function_of_wealth_to_reach_fire/,1605412939.0," 

I found this fascinating. I'll keep this short but I thought this group might appreciate it as well.

I  was doing some light reading on wealth inequality over time and found  this gem. There was a presentation on wealth inequality that predicted  total wealth based on reported income and estimate returns for each  asset class. The thing that stood out to me was that wealthy individual  were not getting any higher return on investments than the rest of the  country and there was an interesting chart on Savings Rate (SR) for each  wealth percentile. They related Savings Rate to Wealth accumulation over time. I think this is directly related to living off of investment income and achieving financial independence.

&#x200B;

Between 1913 and 2013:

* The bottom 90% maximum SR was \~7% in the 1940's and 1980's
* The top 10-1% maximum SR was 35% before 1920
* The top 1% maximum SR was 50% in the 1980's

It is often asked, ""What if Vanguard goes bust?"" The hypothetical answer to the hypothetical question is ""your investments are still ok.""  For example:

This [scenario](https://www.vanguard.com.hk/portal/mvc/loadImage?country=HK&docId=30627) is happening in Hong Kong. 





Basically, Vanguard will leave the Hong Kong market and relocate to Shanghai. It is [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/a66bf3ee-8a98-4eea-ac17-f65c35581d02) that Vanguard's assets will either be acquired or simply terminated.





In fact, Bank of Montreal ETFs are also reportedly leaving Hong Kong, and their funds may be acquired by China AMC.


So I guess it's true that people's assests haven't turned into toilet paper or worse. But now that the funds may have different managers, the investment approach could become very different. Mangagement costs may increase. So the risk is there but more hidden.


Sadly, the remaining global broad market ETFs in Hong Kong have very low volume and small in size.  IMO that's a higher risk. You would feel sad that investors in the city have not much options for global broad market ETFs.

272,Truck Driver: I will achieve financial independence and retire early by 2026. At age 30,,4042,iscqef,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iscqef/truck_driver_i_will_achieve_financial/,1600052667.0,"I’m making this post mostly for myself so I can come back and look back at it in a couple years and also to inspire others in similar situations.

A little backstory: It was the year 2018 and I was a lost 22 year old that was going to community college because I thought there was no other way to get out of lower/middle class. I was attending full-time community college, while also working 50-60 hours a week as a full-time uber/lyft driver. I was making around $250-$350 / week after car expenses. I was basically wasting my time since I had no time to myself and was working just to pay the bills. One day I was driving, my brother texts me a book that I should listen to while driving. The book was called “Rich dad poor dad”. I listened to it and all the information went in the left ear and out the right ear without registering because I was too stressed from attending college and working full-time. 2 months or so go by and I start watching youtube videos on (FIRE) financial independence, retire early. I liked the idea but 99% of the people I watched had all these high paying jobs and right then that idea seemed impossible. Im stressed out again.

Around June, 2018 one night something clicked in my head that I can retire at a early age if I leave the united states and move to a low cost of living country. Since my parents were from India and I was raised in India and came to U.S at the age of 9. I would be very comfortable living there without any issues. I knew the cost of living there is so much cheaper than in the united states and I can retire early at age 30 if I really wanted to. I started doing my numbers to see how long and how much money invested it would take for me to achieve these goals.

As I became more invested in this idea, I decided not to continue my education after community college because I didn’t want to take out student loans that will eventually put me in the rat race where it would be difficult for me to get out of financially. Plus, I was only going to college for money. I started doing more research on careers that pay high income without a college degree and came across on-the-road trucking. At this point, I did not care how hard my life might get because I was set on one goal and that one goal was to retire by age 30 out of united states to a low cost of living country like india. In June 2018, I decided not to continue my education and instead went to go get my CDL Class A license. 

I got my license, got my 2 weeks of training and then drove for a company until August 2019. I saved up every penny after food expenses since I was living out of the truck. In August 2019, I purchased my own truck/trailer and got my own authority to become my own boss on the road. This is the month where my real journey starts. I have been Trucking with my own authority for almost 1 year and lived out of my truck and only went home to see my family couple times a year. I have cut out 99% of my expenses. No car, no debt, no mortgage, no rent and the only thing I have is food expenses and Netflix account and my truck/trailer payment. I finally saved up a good chunk of money that I am ready to buy my first real estate investment property cash. 

So far, my plan is perfectly on track and I should be able be able to retire at the age of 30 without a college degree. 

My numbers:

Current Age: 24

My FIRE number: $1000/month but I am going for fat fat fire and shooting around $4000. Even $2000 is close to impossible to spend in india a month. 

My pay: $260,000 / year gross and around $123,000 net after all expenses. I own my truck and trailer and have my own authority.

I am planning on buying 1 real estate property cash every other year and rent the property out. I mostly look for 9-14% ROI. I am currently looking at properties and waiting for the right one to come on the market.

In 2026, I will have 4 properties that I bought foreclosed at around $130,000-$150,000 price range and which will now be worth around $200,000 fully paid off and all rented out bringing in $4000 passive income and at that time, I should be able to leave the country and live my life freely in india and also travel the world because there is no way I’m spending any where near $4000/month in india. I will have property management company that will look after the properties and I will be available on call if I am needed.

335,"How the financial press is misrepresenting $GME, getting basic facts comically wrong, and generally trying to spin this in Wall Street's favor",News,838,l8zure,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8zure/how_the_financial_press_is_misrepresenting_gme/,1612052552.0,"Greetings from your friendly hedge fund industry insider. (See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/) for my last missive to the community).

I want to check in because I’ve been getting confirmation privately that the hedge funds are hurting while publicly the news articles are saying they’re doing fine--my confidence in WSB’s power to upend the market with its collective power has gotten stronger.

That’s not why I’m writing now, though. I want to show you how the misinformation train keeps coming. Don’t get on.

First, here’s the funniest example of the media getting shit wrong I’ve seen in a while: on the [Bloomberg podcast The Tape](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE0yMjM2OTYwNDk1/episode/YTgzN2RkYzItNjBkYy0xMWViLTgzMzItMWJmNDg4Nzk1MGNm?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjwgpOM8sTuAhWTzTgGHbRDDVYQjrkEegQIDRAL&ep=6) on January 28, Kathy Burton, the hedge fund reporter for Bloomberg, discusses her piece on the trend dismissively by calling WSB a bunch of “Reddit bros” and saying WSB targeted several stocks Melvin Capital had shorted (not true--GME was the only target, and it was targeted because of its overall SI, not because of Melvin or its founder).

That’s not the worst part. The worst part is Burton repeatedly calls GME “Gameshop” (I’m not kidding, go to 26:40 in the podcast). If you’re going to report on a company, maybe get the company name right, k Kathy?

Now look at this post: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/blackrock-s-hildebrand-calls-short-squeeze-mania-some-nonsense. It’s fucking horseshit.

First, BlackRock and JPMorgan dismiss the trend as something that will come and go (they wish) and they blame the Federal Reserve (“It is not surprising when you think about how much liquidity is in the system, how much policy has fueled asset prices in recent weeks and months” is what Hildebrand, Vice Chairman of Blackrock said).

Now, Blackrock is a former client of mine, and I can say this because they’re no longer a client and I haven’t worked with them for years. **One of the worst stock picks and theses behind that stock pick I ever saw was from a portfolio manager at Blackrock who managed many billions of dollars**. Not everyone at Blackrock is bad (I’ve met some very smart people there), but not everyone is good. So even if someone at Blackrock dismisses GME in good faith, it doesn’t mean shit. But Hildebrand is talking in bad faith, clearly, because she wants higher interest rates so financial firms can lend money at higher rates. It’s very likely self-serving dishonesty.

Then there’s the fact that what he said isn’t even true. Money velocity remains at record low levels, indicating liquidity IN THE REAL ECONOMY is not high (unsurprising since QE is a very ineffective means of getting money into the hands of ordinary people--which is not the Fed’s fault, as that’s not really their job).

Plus, asset prices aren’t showing a bubbly tendency at all. Note how Hildebrand doesn’t address the fact that the Nasdaq 100 went down over 4% last week--hardly the sign of a stock market bubble. He’s full of shit.

That isn’t the worst part of this story.

Perhaps the most egregious example of how Wall Street is trying to spin this in their favor is Anne Richards, Fidelity International CEO, who said in an interview that the GME situation shows why there should be LESS transparency for shorting stocks. I’m quoting Bloomberg:

>“The thing that they could do very very quickly is remove the transparency on where the big shorts are, because that seems to be the trigger,” Richards said. “But then of course that takes away from that market transparency which everybody wanted to put in place after the financial crisis.”

She does NOT suggest that there should be MORE market transparency so that investors know how much a hedge fund shorts a stock and when it shorts, so that big shorts can’t accumulate and trigger an event like $GME mooning--no, the market needs LESS transparency, she says, so that retail investors can’t squeeze hedge funds.

This is obvious bullshit, and the fact that it went unchallenged on Bloomberg is a testament to how shoddy their journalism really is. Bloomberg has been the place that gave massive platforms to hucksters like Dennis Gartman, a newsletter writer who was a punchline on Wall Street--we would always say he’s the best contrarian indicator on the market, just do the opposite of what he does. Gartmen quit his newsletter in 2019, which cost thousands of dollars to subscribe to annually, after getting regular interviews on Bloomberg where he was treated as an expert for the unknowing public despite his appalling track record and constant failures.

Now Bloomberg is giving a platform to WS players who are trying to spin the story to deregulate the industry. Absolutely fucking unreal.

Or, well, it isn’t, really. I have seen this happen in my decade in the industry. I have seen mainstream news articles on reports I’ve written that get those reports exactly wrong. I remember one report in particular where the headline was ambiguous, but the report was very clearly positive on the stock for reason X. The news report from one outlet (possibly Bloomberg) said something like “Analyst bearish on stock for reason Opposite-of-X”. It was really funny, and since correcting the record wasn’t good for my employer’s business, we didn’t bother to. That’s just one of many examples of fuckery I have from the financial press, so this misinformation garbage does not surprise me one bit.

Tldr; read the whole post you lazy fuck. But if you can’t read, here’s the deal: the financial press’s activist misinformation campaign is getting more and more transparent.",175,wallstreetbets

TL;DR

For everyone on here that can't read, I’ll keep it short & sweet. Some of you may know I’ve been long GameStop since 2017. We finally exceeded my fair market value, a goal I had always dreamed of. I sold \~95%. 🧻 🤚. Price has gone so far beyond my $169 bull case. The remaining 300 shares march onward to crush the Persian hedge funds in lockstep with those of you still fully strapped aboard the 🚀🚀 🚀 . I believe it is more likely than not we see a higher high.

WORDS:

We flew past it so quickly that I even managed to sell myself a meme-orable fill as I was taking profits. 🧻🖐🤦🏻‍♂️ compared to the immaculate /u/DeepFuckingValue—he has only trimmed while I am \~95% out. I will sell CSPs over the next weeks at prices I’m happy to invest at for the long term after the speculative mania subsides. I have 300 Spartan shares still standing tall at this point and wish for us to see true Valhalla—another sell at $690.69...and beyond. This is my goal now. One thing I always pride myself on is being transparent and honest. I want you all to know I took life changing profits—at least my paper and crayons taste good. Plus I can even buy fresh tendies and tip the tendieman! Cheers to all, and may more tendies cometh soon to all my fellow degenerates. -Rod

Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks. We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.

This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week. Notice how it says ""... this thing is happening in the next few days."" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks.

I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co-operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to ""normal levels"" (fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit). Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?

FAKE NEWS!

Freedom to Trade, Freedom to Choose Profession and Freedom of Association are protected by First Amendment, Ninth Amendment and the US Bill of Rights and so on. 

Hence, although RH might disclaim some liabilities, it cannot disclaim the most basic rights of its customers. As a broker, it is bestowed upon the rights by the state to sincerely HELP its customers buy and sell securities by charging some fees. But it cannot deny them trading securities for some random BS reasons.

So, we all remember the first attack on WSB last week, resulting in the sub going private for an hour so that the mods could get things under control.

If you recall, it was a pure numbers game. Insane amount of obvious bots with brand new accounts spamming tickers and 🚀 with no other actual content.

It was extremely easy to spot and report suspicious accounts. Mods took control quickly.

They have adapted. **Quickly**. The manipulation is currently much more sophisticated.

HFs underestimated individual investors and currently find themselves in a world of trouble. Do not make the same mistake they did. Consider the following:

&#x200B;

Every time you see a post that is ever so subtly guiding your attention away from GME, or has a general tone that the squeeze is basically over, or is giving good SI indicators about other potential squeezes etc, open their profile and do the following:

* **Posts**. Things to look for:

1. What were they posting about a few weeks ago. If its only topics unrelated to finance/investing➡️suspicious
2.  When was the last time they made a post before starting to post about GME/investing. If theres a time horizon greater than 2+ weeks between their usual activity and current GME squeeze posts➡️suspicious . 
3. *Telltale signs*: Account has a long history, posting about topics unrelated to finance and investing. Out of the blue, successive GME squeeze related posts. 

* **Comments**: 

1. Scroll through the comments to get a general sentiment and feeling of how “real” the account is. If they seem to be parroting a lot of GME squeeze related stances in great succession, followed once again by a time period cushion before their usual comments on other unrelated topics ➡️suspicious

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I will not repeat what everyone has heard and is already well aware of by now. We are in a historic event. The stakes are high. Huge sums are involved. Recognize the magnitude of the situation and approach every interaction with caution. Social media manipulation has been “solved” over the last decade, be constantly aware of that. Any information you read, always do your own research, on the topic and on the source itself.

And, of course GME 🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: In regards to the 2+ week time horizon between non finance topics and GME, that only applies to POSTS that are very confident in their advice. Obviously that doesn’t apply to comments. People have naturally gravitated from non finance topics to this historic event over the past few weeks(5m+ new members in a week says it all)",219,wallstreetbets

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",4140,wallstreetbets

509,GameStop Update 4: Weekend Recap,News,397,l8lvr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lvr8/gamestop_update_4_weekend_recap/,1612013944.0,"For those who missed it... Here is what happened this week.

1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.
2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.
3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.
4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.
5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.
6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share
7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).
8. Wednesday morning: ""We Like The Stock"". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350
9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla
10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.
11. A Battle Cry is let out ""We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""
12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m
13. Here is where things get dark...
14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.
15. According to Justin Kan ""Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME""
16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.
17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.
18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.
19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share
20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.
21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company
22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.

WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD 🌎 


From the last few paragraphs of her January 29th report https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-29-2021



“The Democrats’ hand has likely been strengthened this week by the media frenzy over the so-called “GameStop short squeeze,” in which hedge fund managers got squeezed by ordinary investors driving up the price of the stock of a video game retailer so that the hedge funds could not cover short sales. Investment firms promptly cried foul, only to be greeted with derision, since it is not at all clear that their own stock purchases have a better effect on the markets than those of the smaller investors, and since they made huge money betting on the Covid-19 crisis. Observers see the short squeeze as a populist attack on unscrupulous Wall Street types.

While the entire story behind the short squeeze is not yet clear, it does already have a political meaning. The GameStop story reinforced the growing sense that the system has been rigged for the wealthy. People from across the political spectrum are demanding more thorough regulation of the stock market, a dramatic cultural change.”",51,wallstreetbets

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

Not that they are company *like* TSLA or that they will see similar returns.**

EDIT: BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CAN'T READ, BB IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A NEARLY TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY LIKE TESLA. The comparison is with a company that is undervalued because it's going to get in on a *brand new* market that it helps create.

---

BB has some elevated short interest for sure. That short interest may even be increasing. However the float on the stock is massive compared to GME. There are over 550 million available shares of BB, and the short interest is below 100%. While there may be some movement up based on shorts covering, GME is a once in a lifetime thing.

Nothing is the next GME. Not AMC, not NOK, not BB. The large players aren't ever going to be caught this way again in a place where retail investors can screw them, and GME isn't over. If what you want it to participate in that, then you should buy GME.

But I think BB is *fundamentally* more valuable than its current price.

## Current Situation of the Company

BlackBerry, which started as Research In Motion, was the ""original"" smartphone company, before Apple ate them alive. They didn't have the product pipelines or the money to compete against Apple, and the company was nearly killed by the iPhone and later the Samsung Galaxy brand.

Over the last several years, BlackBerry has pivoted into a software security company. They mainly sell security products with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

From Fidelity:

> BlackBerry Limited provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide. The company leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions in the areas of cybersecurity; safety and data privacy; and endpoint security management, encryption, and embedded systems.

Over the last year, BB has re-positioned itself to take advantage of the nascent market of autonomous and intelligent vehicles. (Source: [AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/))

> BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences as well as provide valuable product insights back to the manufacturer.

They also have a partnership with Baidu for that company's Apollo autonomous driving open platform. (Source: [BlackBerry Expands Partnership with Baidu to Power Next Generation Autonomous Driving Technology](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology))

> BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu, whose high-definition maps will run on the QNX® Neutrino® Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).
> 
> ...
> 
> The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu’s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.

Their QNX system is already used in over 100 million cars that are currently on the road, including a direct partnership with [Ford](https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22007012/blackberry-ford-extend-partnership-to-develop-car-software) that they've had since 2016.

They are in the final stages of completing an amazing turnaround as a company, and it looks like they have a good chance of doing it successfully. So what are the challenges?

## Balance Sheet Issues

BB has almost 2/3 of their current ""assets"" tied up in patents. This can be seen on their 2019 balance sheet as ""Intangible Assets – Total: $2.352 billion"". Their assets which are easier to liquidate are nearly exactly their current liabilities ($1.196 billion vs. $1.121 billion), as they added $638 million in debt in FY2019.

Just a few weeks ago, BlackBerry sold 90 of its smartphone patents to Huawei. It also signed a licensing deal with OnwardMobility and Foxconn to allow it's name and software to be used in making a new 5G Android-powered smartphone that has a physical keyboard, filling a small but important niche in the smartphone industry that is mostly untapped at this point.

These moves signal the intent of BlackBerry to leverage parts of its balance sheet that have been mostly sitting idle since 2016 when they exited the smartphone market for good as a manufacturer.

The challenge is that their cash flow and income have been negative or paltry for quite a while. That was never going to turn around until they were able to monetize some of their existing IP and position the company for a solid market segment. At this point, they have successfully done both.

## Earnings

This section definitely depends on your focus and perspective. For instance, BlackBerry's GAAP EPS has been negative more than positive since 2016. But on the other hand, their adjusted actual EPS has beaten consensus estimates for every single quarter going back to Q3 2015.

If you believe in Chen's ability to execute the turnaround, then this seems positive. If you think the company is destined for failure and a slow death, then this seems negative.

## Conclusions

Overall, I think BB is undervalued at its current price. They are very well positioned to take off as autonomous vehicles become more common, and most importantly, they have extremely valuable partnerships in many different markets, including some fantastic access to the Chinese market through their partnership with Baidu.

Autonomous vehicles are a market that doesn't exist yet. Not truly. But many people believe that autonomous vehicles are going to turn into a HUGE segment of the market over the next decade. While car companies (particularly TSLA) provide direct exposure to that, they come with manufacturing risks and other things such as supply-chain risks. TSLA, Toyota, Ford... they could all face issues that simply come down to ""we ran out of good suppliers of Cadmium"" or something similar, while what you want is exposure to autonomous vehicles.

BB has none of that. Their revenue and exposure to the market is entirely within the software, and because of their wide range of partnerships they shouldn't be dependent on any particular manufacturer. I expect to see them reporting positive earnings during FY2021 (though only slightly), and a much more obviously robust performance in FY2022.

Their patent portfolio alone in 2020 was worth about what their market cap was, that's how undervalued this company was due to concern about earnings. Once those earnings turn around, I think the valuation based on *only* fundamentals should put the stock at about $20 *right now*, and about $30-$35 by the end of this year.

There is also a non-trivial chance of a purchase by another company such as Alphabet that wants access to their partnerships, patent portfolio, and machine learning software.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. It is an organization of my own thinking behind the positions I have opened with my money.

---

Overall, BB benefits from its meme-stock status, and a bit of a short squeeze could happen for sure. But based just on my reading of their business itself, I think the stock has room to as much as triple within a year.

I know that everything happening right now is really exciting and makes you want to jump on the bandwagon, but please be careful.

Let me start by saying what we are seeing right now is NOT NORMAL. Like at all. Like this is never gonna happen again.

I think it's very concerning how many people are investing large sums of money into these stocks without knowing a single thing about investing. That is not investing. That is gambling. If you are okay putting a small portion of your net worth on GME, then by all means go for it. But you have to treat that money as if you have already lost it all. People are gonna get hurt by their wild optimism.

**ADVICE: Instead of dumping money into GME, start educating yourselves on the market and build good investing habits. Look into ETFs, mutual funds, growth stocks (start with VTI, VOO, SPY, QQQ, ARKK etc). Be consistent. Educating yourselves now will be way more helpful for your future than blindly investing in companies because Reddit said so.**

All in all I think its a good thing that the GME situation has more gotten people interested in investing, but I really worry that people will get in trouble by not learning the basics and jumping in the deep end with money they can't afford to lose. Please be smart.

AMC is kind of a “fingers crossed for another gamma squeeze” play, I don’t believe there is still enough % short of float to cause GME movement but I’d be very happy if they saw even a fraction of that kind of momentum.  NOK was not the greatest trade I’ve entered into amidst all this but I don’t believe it’s a classic “pump & dump” like some here have said either, they do have a stake in the 5G revolution and I could also see large positions being entered into if it dips back down to pre-GME week levels.",30,options

This week was awesome. This post is not about the implications of what the movement might mean. This post centers around my 2 cents for existing, available trading options for someone that wants to get their beak wet or have skin in the game (""I think he's mixing up metaphors""). I'll be focusing on AMC although the principles still apply to GME. I'll try to keep it short.

Quick background: I'm an engineer/quant developer. I like relying on statistics, probabilities, and juicy risk-to-reward trades. I normally sit out of these huge moves, but when i see opportunities that are overlooked, i'll take them. It also helps that I strongly believe in the continuing power shift from the hedge funds to the collective masses, and I would like to part of it.

I'll start with my conclusion: **2/5 AMC Call Debit Spreads** is one of the better available trades this week.

I trade options, I like having a set risk limit for each of my trades. However, when AMC is having 20-70% daily moves, the reward profile becomes less attractive for me. I think most people here are either buying naked options or shares. I think the risk profile for shares is more or less understood, so let's focus on naked calls.

Let's look at this example for a $13 ITM Weekly Call: [https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9](https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9)

Because the volatility is so high, AMC would have to move 35% by end of week, just for this contract to break even. One could argue that that is a strong case to be selling premium, and they could be right, but it doesn't fit my personal criteria for having a set risk limit for each trade. The downside for selling AMC premium this week is potentially high and, also, how dare you.

Let's compare this to the $12/$13 Call Debit Spread i took on Friday (and there will most likely be similar trades available this upcoming week): [https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq](https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq)

As we can see, the opposite is true. We actually gain value every day that the price holds. I edited the values for the entry because i was able to get filled at $0.20 on Friday, so i'm looking at a 400% gain if AMC closes above 13. Furthermore, my risk is capped at the debit I paid for these spreads.

One of the other benefits is that a naked ITM $13 call will run you > $500 a contract, while the spread was $20 bucks a pop.

Again, this isn't financial advice, just my 2 cents. I'm normally an algo trader with a quant bias, and its hard to model what might happen this week, but I wanted to be on the side of the community while also potentially making a good trade. All this to say, I'm proud of you all. Hope we can hold the line. Cheers.",24,options

584,$GME run is stalling - $QQQ calls to inverse,,43,l8r13t,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8r13t/gme_run_is_stalling_qqq_calls_to_inverse/,1612028654.0,"tldr: factors that drove the $GME run were short squeeze, massive volume buying, value story, and gamma squeeze. All factors are now more limited.

I could be wrong but here's my sense of the situation (none of this is investment advice of course)

1. **Shorts in the market have entered at decent prices** - short borrow rates for $GME were still 30%+ all week which means that as some shorts exited to cover, others were clamoring to get in. Especially with the Thursday dip, the shorts in place are in a comfortable position in terms of squeeze pressure. 140% short interest two weeks ago is different from 120-140% short interest now because of entry prices. Interest levels are high so there is that pressure though

2. **GME is just too expensive** - even without brokerage restrictions, most retail won't be able to afford to risk more than a few shares and institutions aren't going to risk buying at these levels in a game of chicken. It's one thing to buy a few hundred shares at $10/share, it's another at $300/share. And whatever legit value story is likely gone - most value story ranges were probably capped at $30-$90.

3. **Options are juiced and gamma squeeze potential is gone** - there's no delta hedging needed when massive volatility is priced into premium. An expiring 1/29 $500 call yesterday morning was an insane $500+/contract - you now neither have the volume of calls necessary nor the volatility potential to trigger a massive gamma squeeze.

In short, the drivers of the GME run are more limited and it's hard to see what is going to drive more squeeze. Notably, these 3 interact meaningfully (e.g., cheap GME => retail can buy more and more likely to be underpriced options => more likely to gamme squeeze after a big run up => hits shorts that entered at cheap prices forcing them to cover) - with all 3 deflated, there's less of a feedback loop as well.

The answer? $QQQ has been inversely related to the high short stock runs - probably driven by systematic risk fears, but also because long tech / short B&M retail has been a popular HF strategy. 

$GME puts are hella expensive so just going $QQQ calls might be a decent proxy to inverse although there's probably no free lunch out there either way. Probably a call spread",155,options

I know the basics about options (calls=price up, puts=price down) but one concept kinda confuses me if someone would be so kind to clarify. The majority of calls I’ve seen made are a dollar or two OTM but I’ve also seen calls made that are ITM (example: $20 call on a stock that is currently at $21). Is this technically still a call since the price I’m betting on is lower?? Are these just seen as low risk low reward?? Someone pls help & explain like I’m 5 🙏🏽🙏🏽

591,"VIX, Vega Risk, and the GME Situation",,9,l8yuk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8yuk9/vix_vega_risk_and_the_gme_situation/,1612049602.0,"Wednesday saw VIX increased some 60% in a single day. For those who doesn't know, VIX is computed from the implied volatilities of SPX options ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp)). My thoughts are market is really afraid that the GME (and AMC, BBBY, BB, KOSS, and others) situation may pose a systemic risk to the stock market.

Now that the ""short squeeze"" situation stabilizes somewhat, VIX is actually calming down a little bit (on Thursday and Friday, VIX roughly traded within range of Wednesday), even though the broader market just dropped another 2% on Friday.

How does this apply to r/options? Well, options IV is somewhat correlated to VIX, not 100% correlated, but not 0% either (this like saying a particular stock is somewhat correlated to the SPY). For people who sell options prior to Tuesday, they would have gotten absolutely slaughtered on Wednesday (I checked a couple Feb strangles on SNAP and PINS entered on Monday, they were up 50% on Wednesday, even though no breach of the strikes had happened). For people who longed options on Wednesday, they paid a little more premiums than usual, and when VIX dropped the next day, the gains would be smaller than typical even if the assumption on the underlying was correct. 

At this point, I don't have a guess where VIX will go next week. If the ""short squeeze"" situation continues, we may see another round of IV explosion, the stock market sell off doesn't seem done either, so that is another risk factor. Right now, I like to have my option portfolio who I call ""vega neutral"" (it is not beta weighted, so not very precisely neutral), say about positive 40 vega. I assigned about a 50% correlation with my portfolio's IV with VIX, so if VIX drops one point, I say about -$20 PnL if everything stays the same). I achieve vega neutral by by having a mix of long options, short iron condors, long calendar spreads, and short call spread. I basically long vega when the underlying IV (I used IV percentile over the last year) is low and short vega when IV is high. Hopefully, this coupled with a slightly better than 50-50 shot of getting the underlying direction correct and risk management, I can see some gains this coming week.",5,options

PINS has earnings this Thursday, I'm long at Jan '22 calls $80 for $15/per.

You wouldn't think of PINS as cyclical or seasonal, but if you look at their earnings per Q, 4Q destroys every other Q by 50% for the last 4 years. This year, something weird happened, their 3Q was huge. I know they have run up recently, but I believe their are several advantages of PINS vs. FAANG vs. Twitter, etc.

No political fallout - Unlike FB and Twitter, there is really no affiliation with PINS, its just normal people posting remodeling pics. I personally have an $18M budget with a company and we have curbed a lot of advertising with FB and Twitter. Our digital budget hasn't moved, so a lot of that has moved to PINS.

They have not capitalized globally - If I was on the exec board, my first goal would be to capitilize in S America, Asia, etc. Why they haven't started doing this, I have no clue. They should be global by now and I believe now that they are turning positive, and investment globally would skyrocket. I'm sure its on their radar, but this is the growth they need now.

I LOVE high growth earnings companies, I did DD and was in with NIO at $7, JD at $35, BABA at $205 for Jan this year expiries. Thier growth in earnings is phenomenal and their partnership with shops should help them rocket.

My mother uses it like the bible. She is 65. There is something to be said about technology that is used by ""boomers"". When she bought an Apple watch, I bought Apple. When she started talking about Prime, I bought AMZN.

2 concerns....Short term market, might be able to secure lower ins 1 month from now. Second, why haven't they moved globally???? I really think with announced growth or at least investment globally that this could be a $125-$200 stock by next year.

Anyone see a downside to PINS for a 1 year leap?",2,options

Without turning this into a political or class discussion, we should be mindful of what the steps taken by brokerages and clearing houses means for stocks and options valuation.

By placing restrictions on trade, the demand side of the equation is being suppressed, and the effects of this can be seen in the massive volatility of both stocks AND options pricing.

Whether you're opening an options position or buying shares outright, the restriction is going to impact your trade depending on the developments in the coming weeks. This means a mispricing of risk premiums in options; there may be higher risk lurking down the road ahead that may not be priced in.

If you're interested, the full list of equities being restricted extends way beyond what mainstream media is currently covering. RobinHood's list of restricted tickers here:

Everyone during the weekend is awaiting for their funds to transfer in their new account.

The pump is not necessarily being create by WSB, but they are creating the leverage for other firms.

I had a limit order to sell to close 7 deep in the money $GME calls on day of expiry that would have triggered if GME hit around 500.  At 3:30 EST I went to log on to my trading account and sell to close my calls that were deep in the money, and I saw that they had been sold @ 3:00, when $GME was 30-40 less than it was an  hour later, costing me 10's of thousands of dollars over all 7 contracts.

I called and complained, and they told me it was in the terms of service and there was nothing that could be done.  In light of recent investor trading limits put in place by brokers and the news coverage it has been receiving, I blasted them on twitter and got a response from ChaseSupport, who says they will reach out to me next week.

I'm looking at maybe 50k-80k that they made off of me in that half an hour, and the part that makes me the angriest is I called Chase Investments the day before, explained my situation of holding a deep in the money call that was expiring on Friday, and my desire to hold it until the end of the day.  I was assured my option would not be sold until the end of day.

They are very ITM and will likely continue to be ITM in the coming year.

How do you decide on a good time to sell? The longer they go the more potential for upside.  However, if they get closer to January 2021 then they present even less value to potential buyers and less theta. I also I have 2000 actual shares and it would be a good idea to add more shares.

Potential thoughts:

1. Sell entirely for profit at some point and either rotate into something else or buy PLTR shares
2. Trim some options at some point and use profits to buy shares at same price or wait for dip, etc

There is no denying the fact that the premiums on GME are absolutely juicy. Look, I don't want to be those stupid hedge funds writing naked short calls to pocket premium on their short positions. 

I WANT TO BE SMARTER, so, what if I buy 100 shares of gamestop on Monday and sell a covered call every week until I get my shares called or sell premium until I break even? Ideally, I would sell a very aggressive short call, I would sell something like a .60 delta. If my shares get called away, oh well, I made money on the way up. If not, I will keep selling calls until they get called away. Worse comes to worst, I get stuck and have to sell premium until I get my money back and more. 

&#x200B;

Can someone explain why this wouldn't work? I am aware that gamestop could tank and I would lose on the shares. But if this trades sideways or goes up to 1k I would pocket the premium and also make over 100% on the shares.

To start, I have:

$AAPL—1/29 Closing Price: $131.96

* 2/5 AAPL 149. Strike price: $3.8 x 2 contracts = $760 cost of entry. (Current Value: $0.39 x 200 = $78)
* 2/5 AAPL 150. Strike price: $3.63 x 4 contracts = $1452 cost of entry (Current Value: $0.34 x 400 = $136)
* 2/19 AAPL 150. Strike price: $2.84 x 1 contract = $284 cost of entry (Current Value: $1.04 x 100 = $104)
* 3/19 AAPL 155. Strike price: $3.1 x 4 contracts = $1240 cost of entry (Current Value: $2.12 x 400 = $848)

* 2/12 AAPL 149. Strike price: $0.76 x 6 contracts = $456 cost of entry. (Current Value: $0.76 x 600 = $456)
* 2/19 AAPL 140. Strike price: $3.45 x 1 contract = $345 cost of entry . (Current Value: $2.64 x 100 = $264)

Yes, I am an idiot and I likely shouldn't have done any of this. I feel like there is no coming back from the first 4 calls.  I got in on a few other calls as you can see from the photo (FB & MSFT) but I'm a tad more hopeful about them.

The reason why I got into the latter 2 calls from Friday's drop is due to thinking that a rebound has to be within short-reach due to the liquidation of the stock to cover the shorts, but also from others looking to unload and throw it all in on the GME short squeeze. Further, I figured the dividend day being on 2/5 might be some form of a catalyst for the rebound. After the monstrous quarter AAPL just had, I was hard-pressed to think that this liquidation sale will be persistent. With that in mind, getting in the green wouldn't be very much work. I can still see this crashing down to 123-124 and not recovering for multiple months as well though. 

I don't know what I don't know at this point and have been getting wrecked overall as many others. Breaking even after all of this feels like a dream. Any thoughts? Thanks all.

I have seen some KO products out there for specific indexes (e.g., DAX, DOW, Nasdaq 100) and to me, they seem like an ideal way to make a diversified investment with some leverage (I am thinking about 2x or 3x). 

Would using the KO certificates for an ETF for a long term hold be equivalent to margin investing in those ETF? The KO price seems to me to be equivalent simply to a margin call -- but because they are traded securities and no margin call by the issuer is possible, the knock-out kicks in; this seems to me to be fair. So, can I think of these two way of investing (KO certificates and margin purchases) as equivalent?

I ask because KO certificates seem mostly to be used by day traders. But, at least with HSBC, the per annum interest rate is fantastic (around 3% p.a. at the moment). And, assuming the markets go up 8-10% p.a., with 2x leverage, I think the gains should be pretty good (like 13% - 17%?).

Example: GME

$25 strike put currently at $0.83

$25 strike call currently at $304.78

If I sell the put, I get $83. Collateral $2,500.

If I buy 100 shares at spot price, $312.01, it'll cost $31,201 for collateral. 

$31,201 - (304.78\*100) = $723 in net credit, but you're almost guaranteed to get assigned because GameStop will never go down, diamond hands. You keep $723, but lose the difference between stock price and strike price, let's say it reaches $400. So ($400 - $25)\*100 = $37,500. You got $723 in credit and lost $37,500 so you lose $36,777. How is this equivalent to getting $83 from the put? Is my math wrong?

Conversely, if the stock goes to $24, the put is assigned.
In the same circumstance, the call is not assigned and you get to keep $30,478 in premium - $28,801 = $1,677. Which is way more than the put makes if assigned.",5,options

As everyone knows, $GME has been causing quite a bit of news lately.  There has been a huge buying frenzy for $GME shares along with a handful of other companies.  On Thursday, Robinhood restricted purchasing $GME shares and options citing liquidity issues.  By Thursday evening, Robinhood acquired 1 billion in additional funding and announced that they were allowing limited purchases of $GME stock and option contracts.  This turned out to be 5 shares and 5? contracts of $GME.

On Friday, by midday, Robinhood restricted GME share purchases to 1.  Shortly before market closing, this thread r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/ was posted by u/adioking.  He basically posted that you could buy a Feb5 $0.50 C contract and immediately exercise the contract giving you 100 shares. 
 There was a lot of downward pressure on GME prior to this post.  $GME ended up closing above 320 which was great because all call options 320 and lower ended itm. 

Friday evening, after market close, Robinhood announced trading restrictions on 50 stocks https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-restricts-gamestop-stock-trading-23-companies-app-2021-1

I believe buying and exercising $GME Feb5 call contracts directly caused Robinhood to put limits on other high volume stocks due to liquidity issues.  That said, I really don't know what I am talking about.  Thoughts?

673,Clarifications on Option Losses,,1,l8o3ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8o3ld/clarifications_on_option_losses/,1612020916.0,"After doing some research I still need a bit of clarification on max losses of different options. There doesn’t seem to be any articles, videos out there that get very explicit on what you can lose

Here is my understanding:

1. Buying a Call (Buying to Open) - max loss is the total amount you paid for the contract only, meaning your max loss is LIMITED.
Example: if the call contract cost $1,000 with a strike price of $50 and the stock only ever reaches $49 upon expiration date....your max loss is $1,000


Selling to close option on this contract:

1A. Sell before expiration (for unlimited profit or max loss of $1,000)

1B. Exercise option before expiration (buy the contract and pay stock price for 100 shares)

1C. Contract expires worthless for max loss of $1,000


2. Buying a Put (Buying to Open) - max loss is the total amount you paid for the contract only, meaning your max loss is LIMITED.
Example: if the out contract cost $500 with a strike price of $30 and the stock only dips to $35 upon expiration date....your max loss is $500


Selling to close option on this contract:

2A. Sell before expiration (for unlimited profit or max loss of $500)

2B. Exercise option before expiration (buy the contract and pay stock price for 100 shares)

2C. Contract expires worthless for max loss of $500


3. Selling a Call (Selling to Open aka Writing a Call) - Max Loss is UNLIMITED (you could lose $800 Million dollars for a crude example) 
Example: You sell a call and the buyer on the other side decides to exercise this option. You now must pay the buyer whatever the current price of stock is, which could be -4000% of what it originally was when you wrote the contract.


4. Selling a Put (Selling tonOpen aka Writing a Put) - Max Loss is UNLIMITED (you also lose $800 Million dollars for crude example purposes)
Example: You sell a Put and the buyer on the other side decides to exercise this option. You must pay the buyer whatever the current price of stock is (multiplied by 100 shares if it’s only 1 contract), which could be +2,000% of what the stock price originally was when you wrote the contract.

I was up huge on Disney, Airlines and $HDB back in Feb. I held a little to long and Fed printer went Brrrrr. Ouch! Lost over 45K. Anyway boohoo.

## What is next play?

We got a nice little tweet from [@WSBgod](https://twitter.com/WSBgod):

[Educate Yourself](https://twitter.com/WSBgod/status/1355004490122887168?s=20) It is pretty hard to read but well worth it. Love learning more about Burry!

## Here is a short summary:

Short squeeze makes a frenzy of buying. Actors with no position buy because the stock is running high and want to get in on big gains. Actors with short positions, those that short sold the stock, will hedge against their short positions by buying stock. Eventually it will be time for the actors with short positions to pay up. They will get a margin call from the prime broker. When they can't pay, the debit will fall to the prime broker. This debt will then be shared by many prime brokers.

What happens when we get some debt among all the hedge funds? Well they will need to sell many of their positions. We saw the start of this today. Many big name stocks with good evalutions selling off. So you can short whatever you like and it will probably be good going forward for the near/medium term.

Let's look at $SPY

[SPY Chart](https://preview.redd.it/yzkix5muzde61.png?width=2724&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49413b9a4aa98b2bf35d10e6ddeaf79d8f0b85e)

Here we see a big red candle, bearish engulfing. We have also bounced off the trendline. RSI is also showing lower highs starting at the high back in 2018, then another bounce in 2020. Also the squeeze momentum chart also shows lower high momentum. We should keep an eye on the 325 level where we saw support previously.

Here is another person I like to follow on Twitter, [@mtmalinen](https://twitter.com/mtmalinen) also sounding [rather bearish lately](https://twitter.com/mtmalinen/status/1354788065634643972?s=19). He points to some different concerns about debt around Europe and US. Not a good sign for markets.

**WRONG!** Here are some places where IV is still low and option prices are cheap. Volume is not great but we can fix that! Jump in the rocket ship before we blast off! 🚀🚀🚀

## List of targets ordered by P/E ratio

1. [$AMG](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMG/)
2. [$ICE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-ICE/)
3. [$APAM](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-APAM/)
4. [$TD](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-TD/)

I personally like the puts on $ICE, here is the [chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICE/options?p=ICE). The IV has not exploded so options on this are still cheap relative to other things out there. IV is in the 30% range here. The volume isn't the greatest but $ICE has more volume than $AMG. Which is why I like $ICE better than $AMG. Also just sounds great to have some whisky on $ICE baby!

**Tangent!** If you aren't sure which whisky to drink while gambling on stocks, can't go wrong with [Nikka Coffey Grain](https://www.nikka.com/eng/brands/coffey-grain-malt/)! It isn't a super expensive bottle and taste is among the best! The mouth feel is incredible, like silk is grinding its lady parts on your tounge!

Expect a dip, possibly a significant one Monday morning in GME. The restriction of trading this week, and especially the options restrictions fucking shot the momentum in the balls. “Buy the fucking dip” - warren buffet. yolo on FD's like a fucking a champ. 

by restricting GME late last week, Gamma ramp was fucking kneecapped. Part of what drove the early week action was the fact that every single GME call in existence was ITM. MM's had to delta hedge 100 shares for every single call that existed.  that obviously sent price to the fucking moon. This week however they will be unwinding A LOT of shares since the same effect did not occur, because they were playing fuck fuck games. based on open interest I expect there will be more net selling in the unwind vs. buying from put winds. Hence I expect a dip. Note I said dip, not collapse.

The collapse is backstopped by you retards HODLing shares. it will come at some point. not yet though. for the inevitable to be avoided though upward momentum has to be SOLIDLY re-established. Now we dont know what other tricks they have in store for us this week, but rest assured they will be used and they will make up new shit. to refuel the rocket though Gamma does need to ramp again. thats where our favorite FD's come in. 2/5 and 2/12 volume is gonna be a big determining factor if it is to be reclaimed.

So if Robinhood goes under the SEC will freeze all the accounts. The SIPC protects up to $500k in accounts. It takes months to unwind and get your money back. Move the money now. This could become a nightmare. Robinhood is dealing with the classic run on the bank scenario. Everyone wants out but they can’t process it fast enough depleting needed capital as fast as they can get new VC Capital in. So they need to put up more margin and they are losing Capital out the door. I’ve seen many huge firms go under including one I worked with, AIG. It was AAA rated Dow stock at the time.

Technically, if the price of the stock goes up, I collect the premium and all the money I make in account 1 due to price movement is offset by account n 2. If the price goes under break even in account 1, I still collect the premium and all losses due to the price movement are offset by the 100 shares in account 2 that gain the same amount.

[S3 partners: GME short interest at 113%](https://mobile.twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219) 

[WSB will not allow me to post since I’m less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]

I love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here’s why:

There were 50M trades yesterday. Retail investors couldn’t buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys yesterday, that’s 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.

Does that mean the price won’t go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it’ll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who’ll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who’ve likely already exited their positions.

This is all theory. I hope I’m proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don’t think they’d want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.

Welcome your thoughts. But please don’t pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people’s money is at stake here.

PS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I’m prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.

PS2: Please get the hell out of Robinhood. Those sellouts built their business on us retail investors and they’ve sold us out to their hedge fund buddies. Democratizing trading my ass.",103,options

Right now at a stock price of $329, there are 63,025 calls expiring in the money today. At 100 shares per contract, that's 6,302,500 shares potentially trading hands after market close today.  I say potentially because some people may choose to roll them out to a later date, reasons unbeknownst to me.

\-$115 - 10,371 contracts

\-$200 - 9,233 contracts

\-$320 - 7,835 contracts

The next highest strike up with high interest is $570 with 3,949 contracts. 

I don't think it's any coincidence that the current price is hovering around $320.  If I had to make a retarded guess, I'd say it's being ever so slightly manipulated to hover here.  My uneducated guess is that just before market close, we'll see a short attack to drive it below $320, forcing the 7,835 call contracts at the $320 strike to expire out of the money.

I am not very familiar with the behind the scenes details of options and I have some concerns about a potential for a large number of retail bag holders. If an OTM call becomes close to or in the money it is my understanding that the broker is forced to purchase the underlying. It is also my understanding that the goal of WSB was to prevent them from actually doing this but I am seeing a lot of talk about these short sellers having already covered, at least for today.

If that is true, and they actually did cover, everyone just moves on to the next week to again try to squeeze the short sellers into a position to not be able to cover their shorts.  It is also my understanding there is no place to see daily or real time the short percentage. Is that true?

If the brokers were not able to cover the shorts that expired ITM today they would be forced to buy them next week, creating a squeeze?

Now for the big question, if 100% of the float is shorted and 30% of the shorted stock expired today the brokers would have give those shares to the people that exercised? If those shares have been handed over there would now be 70% of the stock shorted and 30% more people looking to sell their shares to the broker to fill the 70% remaining shorted? If this is true I foresee an every man for himself scenario and a lot of retail bag holders in the near future, which saddens me due to the number of YOLO posts posted  over on WSB.

AMC for example, you can sell 14 DTE puts at $10 strike and you get $400 in premium for every contract, with IV being at 600%+. That's 40% return on investment!!!

Now there could be two scenarios, where you both win from:

* If AMC goes to the moon -> you miss on it BUT you get juicy premium and easy 40% ROI.
* If AMC loses value -> you're forced to buy AMC BUT you'll enter at $6/share, which is a really good entry, instead of buying right now at $12-$15 market price.

Why don't people do this with every stock that they wanna get into? You can legit buy these with half the market price if you're smart and sell high IV options.

Now you could say that they're losing on potential earnings if AMC moons BUT couldn't you sell far OTM puts to make sure you get exercised to buy the stocks? 

14 DTE $30 strike gives you $2100 in premium, that's 70% ROI and you either pocket quick $2100 or you get a $9 entry price. 

And you only need a buying power of (strike price - premium) which is $600-$900 in this case, depending which strike price you choose.

&#x200B;

Assume MEOW is trading at $100, and I sell a cash covered put at $90.

Would I be able to make effectively risk free premium on this put by hedging the risk of assignment, and selling my 100 shares of MEOW if price drops below $90(with the intention canceling out the effect of the assignment)

&#x200B;

\---

Edit: really appreciate all the feedback. I should clarify my question with an example:

&#x200B;

Portfolio 1: I buy 100 shares of MEOW at $100 and plan to hold it forever

Portfolio 2: I buy 100 shares of MEOW at $100, and sell 1 cash put with a strike price of $90 and for $5, at the same time I sell the put, I place a $90 limit sell order for 100 shares of MEOW

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: MEOW goes up to $200 - in this case the gains are the same and the option expire and I make an extra $500 from the premium

&#x200B;

Scenario 2: MEOW goes down to $80. 

Portfolio 1 is just down $2000

In this case the limit order hits and my MEOW are sold at $90, at some point I would get assigned and buy back 100 shares of MEOW. So in effect I am still holding 100 shares of MEOW which is down $2000, but in this case I made $500 in premium

&#x200B;

Conclusion: in both cases, in the end I have 100 shares of MEOW(either in profit or loss but the same), but Portfolio 2 is just net up $500 of premium. Am I correct conclude that for any stock I plan to buy and hold, I can use the opportunity to make risk free returns as long as I have some extra cash on the side?

Robinhood released the limits and restrictions on the shares you can buy, and even HOLD. If you already own more than 10 GME option contracts, you are out of luck. It is pretty restrictive and crazy... here is the info from RH to make smart decisions today 😉

Are there limits to increasing my existing positions?
Yes. The table below shows the maximum number of shares and options contracts to which you can increase your positions. Please note that these are aggregate limits for each security and not per-order limits, and include shares and options contracts that you already hold. These limits may be subject to change throughout the day.

   

Symbol	Shares	Options contracts
AAL	55	50
AMC	115	100
BB	65	100
BBBY	30	50
CTRM	1650	N/A
EXPR	200	100
GME	5	10
KOSS	25	N/A
NAKD	750	N/A
NOK	110	100
SNDL	1200	100
TR	25	50
TRVG	400	100
 
 

What if my existing positions already exceed the limits?
If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.",9,options

I dont tend to try to explain my investment theories / strategies / ideas too much; Years back I really appreciated [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) as I was learning and so to those, old and new, I feel like I have to say this.

The videogame store stock itself is unimportant (and i mean, ofc. It's fn a b+m business that sells digital content). So are any other tickers that are blowing up right now. What is important is that retail traders for the first time have actually had an effect on the market that was so significant that all the establishment basically had to go code brown and pull out their hail-mary's like completely blocking trading on the app they know is probably (actually, no, they (hedge funds etc.) know FOR SURE - because they've been buying robin hoods data). Shit that is in a super gray area legally and could EASILY be construed as clear market manipulation if you can prove some ties between RobinH and hedge funds, etc.

This isn't about M\*\*\*n. This isnt about any short selling firm in general. They're a blip. What has Wall Street scared is that this is unprecedented and represents the \*chance\* for a change in power and influence over the market that has never been seen. Wall St fat cats have been making easy, safe money for years off the riskier trades of retail traders (or, I should say maybe, the inherently-more risky trades necessary when one doesnt have billions to work with). One, two, five hedge funds going out of business IS NOT THE CONCERN.

THIS IS THE CONCERN - We've been seeing a widening wealth gap and opportunity for income and social mobility has been shrinking and shrinking as a great divide has formed between the elite and the average person. Anyone with a brain knows that doesnt work for ever - at some point people dont have any more to give (or lose), people are out of patience, people get hungry, people get angry. That spread cannot continue. THIS MOVEMENT OF LETS GET TOGETHER AS RETAIL TRADERS, TALK TO EACH OTHER, REALIZE WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM - that could be the GREAT EQUALIZER that we have been needing for years as the US economy becomes more and more slanted in one direction (ie, the mega-rich).

THAT, my friends, is why we've seen such a strong reaction. The system the elite has built is not made to handle the masses all uniting for a cause. Look, I know this might sound a bit extreme, but how do you think any civil (or not so civil) revolution has ever come about? It's the populace getting sick of the manipulation of the top minority and exercising the sheer force of their numbers.

Even better, this is a war of DOLLARS not of knives, guns, and blood. The US military-industrial complex cant just stop this revolution. This has the potential to really, swiftly, re-distribute wealth in America based on MERIT rather than family history. The American dream is that this a meritocracy where those who think right and do shit right get ahead. Nothing about the G\* short squeeze plan is stupid. But we saw serious resistance yesterday thanks to the actions of brokerages and the general wall street establishment.

I know [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) gets a lot more old school traders that have probably seen this or that fad come and go. I've been watching WSB and related stuff for a few years now thinking about what sort of power it could end up generating. We're getting the first glimpse.

Not only do people with big positions kinda need this to not just fizzle out - we all need it to keep going because otherwise, the status quo will remain until it does come to some sort of violent revolution down the line. In the past 15 min I've seen articles from the likes of Mark Cuban basically saying the same thing.

I'm not saying buy into G\* - thats of course pretty crazy at $100+ a share, and that's your choice based on your risk tolerance and what part you want to play - but dont dismiss this and side with the establishment, because they're covering their asses. What I'm saying is that if, as the ""meme stocks"" start adding newer tickers to their lists based off what's closed, and the same shit keeps happening, I dont know what proof more you need that this IS IN FACT getting to the establishment. Or look at some hedge fund managers cry on the news about the damn kits on the internets. They are outdated. They're resting on their (not well-deserved) laurels. MONEY drives the modern world and has been the tool of the ruling elite for years. Even if nobody makes money on this shit, showing how superficial and stupid some of these constructs are - and how vulnerable to any coordination - is proving a very important point about the power of the people, thanks to online trading apps the the establishment themselves developed, thinking, ""Let's get more stupid retail traders for more dumb free money"".

So, in short - screw them. Whether here or ws bets, love your fellow retail traders and don't let this same shit that's been happening for years happen in such an extreme and obvious way. I dont have the total solution here - but we are on the brink of the possibility of a HUGE economic disruption that could turn the 1% into the 25% in a few weeks. That seem like a bull-case scenario for it? Sure. But it's not impossible. I just hope people understand the magnitude of this. It's definitely the biggest thing on the market since the housing crisis, and quite possibly the dot-com bubble or even the crash of 29. It's significant. Please dont just dismiss it as dumb kids on the meme-forum. Those dumb kids really caught on to something.

I have my eyes set on a potential Japanese takeover candidate and I've been researching how to trade options. Needless to say the pricing is pretty straight forward but the market is VERY thin from what I can tell. Is it safe to say brokerages in Japan just don't do a lot of call/put trading?

I think I have it pretty much figured out now though - Osaka only permits futures trading \~8 months out and that too as a European call option. Nothing I've read suggests I can go any further out even though I'd love to have a 2-year horizon on this - it would be well worth the premium IMHO.

My question (as the subject says), is what happens if this company gets bought out? Or if they sell a part of the company and treat it as a special dividend or spin it out and give stock in the spin out to existing shareholders - as an option holder (that too European-style), am I just basically out of luck?

I suppose we can break down the possible scenario in three categories:

1. Whole company gets acquired before September - what happens then? If the acquirer is a private company or a foreign company - how is this settled? Does the expiration get moved up or does it turn into an American-style option at that point and I can convert my position?
2. Company spins out a subsidiary or sells a subsidiary and issues a special dividend or gives proportional stock for shareholders - basically am I out of luck since I'm not entitled to that? BTW as I understand it, Asian companies are known to do this (bonus shares, etc. for existing shareholders).
3. Company spins out and allows outside investor(s) to invest in this spinout company but dilutes their own holding down to 50% for example - this is the scenario I'm least concerned about since the company is still owned by the parent, just diluted

Also two more slightly related questions:

1. Is there any way to trade American-style options on Japanese equities or at least their corresponding ADRs? Please correct me if I'm incorrect. It seems like Japan is decades behind in terms of trading mechanisms and derivatives.
2. Do I actually need to convert the European option at the end of the contract or can I straight up just trade the contract and get something close to the same as a conversion?",2,options

They generally don't have a stake in things either way.

What MM's do with regards to options, for anyone unfamiliar, is they write brand new options contracts. Calls and puts. They are, generally, the ones who are setting the bids and asks on the strikes you look at.

Yes, individual investors can and do write options, but it's very rare for individual investors to write naked options, which are necessary for people to have long options positions. There has to be a counter-party to the contract that is taking the opposite side.

How they do this is by acquiring a combination of securities that offset the delta and gamma of the contract they have written. As the price goes up and the contract gains a higher delta, they must acquire more of these securities. 

These securities can be some forms of insurance and derivatives, but the easiest and most common way for MM's to hedge their delta and gamma on a contract is to buy a portion of the underlying. As the price goes up, they must buy more to offset the greeks, as it goes down they sell. This allows them to remain price neutral.

At least a part of what happened today with Robinhood, WeBull, and IB is that the MM's those platforms use ran out of stock. Nobody was selling, the MM's ran out of stock, and thus the platforms could not fulfill buy requests. 

The brokers that stayed open for business had access to more of the existing stock, such as Fidelity and to a lesser extent TDA.

Tomorrow though, we may run out of stock, and people may be unwilling to sell. In that situation, there is no reliable way for MM's to hedge delta and gamma against new contracts, and it's possible that *options* markets may see a liquidity problem on these tickers for new contracts. 

Nearly 25% of all GME stock in existence expires tomorrow ITM if the stock is above $500, to give a scope of the issue.

This will probably happen at the same time that some of the short sellers are attempting to further cover their positions.

Pay attention to some of these tickers, we are likely to see some never-before-seen events in options markets tomorrow.

First, I hope you're familiar with the concept of max-pain, and today is the essence of max-pain trying to kill off every written option to maximize returns.

For example, this is a [list of FB calls expiring today](https://ibb.co/YWBKzFk), nearly 57,000 options with rights on 5.7m shares. Every last call owner until 250 will be massacred today, a good thing if you wrote 275 (covered or naked) calls a few weeks ago instead of buying them.

Then here is the [same story with FB puts](https://ibb.co/8zgsFgs), with nearly 40,000 of them being massacred out in the open. The max pain area for FB for the day will be between 250 and 257, the lower it goes, you should pick up any option expiring next month or later.

The story is the same for AAPL, AMD, and MSFT where everyone is getting slaughtered regardless of their position's side. For AAPL the max pain area seems to be $130 to $131, AMD's is $87-$88, and anything above $88C or below $87P is well butchered. MSFT's max pain is around $230 to $235, anything above $235C and below $230P is wrecked. Again, puts will be up today, there is no doubt about it given the market bleed, but they are only up relative to yesterday.

I can see us trading for the rest of day within those thresholds, and personally, it's a great time to pick up cheap calls for FEB. I welcome all criticism and thoughts... also, not financial advice.

**Positions:**

1. AAPL 3x $150C FEB 26 @ $1.6
2. FB 5x $300C FEB 26 @ 1.9

i've had a couple theories about this but the one that makes the most sense is the commission is the small cut the brokers gets for being the middle man, not the amount i pay to the other investor on the other end of this contract. i thought maybe the $414 is the amount owed for entering the contract, but i played with the numbers and the difference between the current price and the strike price adds up to this $414 which made me question if this is the amount owed to enter the contract or the amount realized if i exercise my right to the contract at the strike price.

I encourage EVERYONE to wait out this absolute shit storm.

We’ll review your spread 60-90 minutes before closing on your spread’s expiration date. At that point, a few different things can happen:
If both legs are in the money, we’ll assign and exercise them.
If both legs are out of the money and are not at risk of being in the money, we’ll let your positions expire.
If one leg is at risk or in the money, we'll close the spread.
Keep in mind that the Risk Check occurs about an hour before market close on the date of expiration. Risk Checks cannot be opted out of.

Given that GME is, unlike VW, involving FAR more informed investors, the volatility increase is bound to be much higher and affect overall market volatility to an unprecedented degree. The mainstream coverage of this event also will lead to an increase in volatility. Buy VXX or VIX calls.

We're in extraordinary times right now, where it's very lucrative to randomly buy stocks that are being heavily shorted. In 1999 it was very lucrative to randomly buy tech stocks, and people were saying the same shit back then, that it's easy to trade and the average person can make a fuck ton of money doing so. Every once in a while people claim that the investment world has changed, and that fundementals don't matter anymore. this is EXACTLY what people said before the dot com crash.

very short term, fundamentals don't matter, but for actual long term investments, fundamentals and security analysis are extremely important. the guys that have been in this sub for a while know this, but it's important for the new people here to realize that this type of trading is extremely unusual, and the strategies that allow you to make huge profits right now will very likely bankrupt you if you try to continue with the blind buying of heavily shorted stocks.

After the big move down, the rest can feel like a drawn out whimper. It's also never in a straight line.

From a trading perspective all of this mania in options creates situations where premiums are high and using options to express any view can involve increased risk. Below are a couple examples of strategies where costs might be reduced (and therefore overall risk might be lessened) with multi leg strategies (vs the really high premium of single leg calls and puts). It focuses on bullish for inevitable bounces, bearish for those that want to position for when the squeeze ends, and neutral for those that want to sell into the insane vol. This is all for informational purposes. Things are wild in these names and sometimes the best strategy is just kicking back and watching. But what I'll discuss here is how to use multi-leg with very defined risk, to reduce cost, and not get crushed by implied vol or massive moves.

&#x200B;

**Using a directional Butterfly to lessen cost**

An Iron Butterfly lessens the premium at risk versus an outright option buy and even vertical spreads. It is typically thought of as a neutral trade but its center can be used as a rough price target in the stock, providing a wide range of profitability for a very low premium outlay

As an example, let’s look at a butterfly to the downside, in GameStop. This involves selling a call spread (+160c/-80c), and selling a put spread (-80p/+9p) with overlapping strikes at 80, creating a target near 80 in the stock. What makes this trade fairly inexpensive compared to other bearish strategies is it’s selling 2 options at an extremely high volatility, via Options Ai

Butterfly [Chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-28-at-11.50.56-AM.png)

This Butterfly example is profitable anywhere between $143 and $17 in the stock with a max gain at $80. Its profits trail off the farther it is from $80 but it makes some money anywhere between those two breakevens (at expiration)

Its max loss is anywhere above $160 or below $9 in the stock. The strikes and where to center the butterfly is just an example above, the center should be thought of as a price target and is completely up to the trader where to target. Often in wild stocks these type of strategies can be found for very little premium outlay compared to the wide range in the stock where profitability in the trade is possible. And as I mentioned in a previous post, it can even be done a simple 1x2, if the strikes are equidistant from zero, using zero as the free lower wing of the fly (e.g. 100p/50p 1x2, 50p/25p 1x2 etc)

&#x200B;

**Using call spreads directionally to lessen cost**

And for those that are bullish after large selloffs, again, spreads might be better utilized than simply buying an outright call. Here’s a Debit Call Spread, that takes advantage of the high price of out of the money calls to greatly lessen the required breakeven level in the stock:

Call Spread [Chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-28-at-11.52.44-AM.png)

Upside calls in these stocks are quite expensive and this type of trade takes advantage of that by selling those far out of the money calls to greatly reduce the cost of the near the money call being bought.

&#x200B;

**Selling to both the bulls and the bears, with defined risk**

Then of course there is a completely neutral view. Here’s an example of using the expected move to create an Iron Condor, establishing a range of max gain if the stock remains between its short strikes:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zz0wuttbq6e61.gif

Implied volatility in these stocks is off the charts. And it’s been rising as the stocks go higher, and will likely compress as the stocks go lower. Therefore, traders need to be very aware of the premium risk they are taking on both the long and short side of options.

Per spotgamma:



Not to defend 

@robinhood

but its likely the decision to remove $GME wasn't theirs. Here is a rough theory: Best guess $delta for MM's was $5bn = 15mm shares w/stock @ $350. GME float ~46mm much of which locked up by HODL'ers. Simply not enough stock.

50% of the gamma in the name was tied to 320 strike and 1/29 expiration. With 50-65k contracts in the money set to expire on 1/29, the potential share delivery may have mean ""failure to deliver"" as there aren't enough shares to settle. That creates a whole mess. 

To stop the squeeze and prevent larger systemic problem, the SEC tells brokers no more trading in $GME. $AMC and the stocks flop.

It was a indirect way of giving the Hedge Funds a bailout by changing the rules of trading in order to force the price down. It all started when Robinhood decided to cease the trading of GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more. These are the popular ""meme"" stocks on the sub reddit (WSB). After Robinhood did this act that none of us saw coming, other Brokers followed suit. Even Webull was ""forced"" to do the same.

The CEO of Webull said, ""It wasn't our choice... this has to do with settlement mechanics in the market."" The irony of it all is that Robinhood, an broker name after a vigilantly that stole from the rich to give to the poor, did the exact opposite. In fact, Robinhood stole from the poor retail traders and gave to their billionaire hedge fund friends.

I personally will not be using Robinhood anytime soon. I advise everyone to boycott them for manipulating the markets. Maybe a class action is soon to follow?

My question is - what's stopping me from buying long-dated call credit spreads ATM:

For example, Sell Apr 16 250 Call/ Buy APR 16 270 Call. Got a quote for this yesterday at 9.79 premium. and max loss of 2000 - premium.

The likelihood that the stock will be lower than 250 in April seems really high to me, are there any risks to this position that I'm not seeing?

And you have $1B in leveraged capital at your disposal.  

&#x200B;

1. You know the halt is going to happen, so you load up on GME OTM Jan 29 puts.
2. You are your hedgie buddies see the order book and limits, and sell back and forth all the way down to sub $200, increasing your put options values. You may have bought shares at $300, but it doesn't take too much volume and option gain will more than offset it. 
3. You know Robinhood and others will lift the trading ban tomorrow. It is in your control. 
4. Close out puts before market close (Today) for big gain
5. Load up and buy GME OTM calls. Jan 29 or Feb 5 expiration, not sure?  Someone has to sell these calls to you though. 
6. After hours trading with hedgie buddies, not hard to have ""artificial gains"" that entice retailers tomorrow morning. You can use this time to start buying back some shares to drive price even more (to cover your short). This is where you are taking a loss on your original position. 
7. Market opens, retailers come back in full force and start buying up shares, thinking they're still hurting the big bad suits, but you are laughing along with them 
8. You can momentum trade even more with more short positions you need to close (buying back stock)
9. GME spikes to $1000 or more 
10. Sell your calls now ITM right as you are close to closing out your original short position 
11. You've effectively damage controlled your massive short position,

Well we have a very big bull run last year so most people make more than a few hundred percent. But well I am happy with what I achieve and I set a target to achieve it again this year.

&#x200B;

Just in case you are wondering I am not selling you anything. There is nothing to buy here

&#x200B;

The strategy I employ is the Options Wheel Strategy (this is nothing new, selling cash secured put, selling covered call and collecting dividend)

&#x200B;

1) Selling Cash Secured Put (collect premium)

2) if assign stock, sell covered call against it and let stock get call away

3) If you are holding stock you may get some dividend from some stock but also bearing in mind most of us has a margin account so we need to pay interest to hold the stock when we borrow 50% typical setting for most brokerage so don't count on dividend as a income

&#x200B;

Benefit of this

Targeting 1% a week, 4% a month or 52% a year (this is the objective) We can make more when we have a good run in stock more on that later

&#x200B;

Best Market Condition

This is a bullish strategy, it benefit from sideway to up market. Minor down market is easily overcome (correction of 10 - 15%)

If it is a bear market like what we have in 2020 feb to april the strategy will lose money and need a long time to recoup back

&#x200B;

Stock not suitable (stable, low IV stock)

EEM, EBAY, KO this will all not work well following the 1% rule (I will discuss it later)

&#x200B;

Stock that is good right now (High IV and stock is potential for a good run up)

Nio, Fubo, AMD, NNDM, SURF (many more)

If you do not think the stock will go up or if you think the stock will go down then do not start the process at all

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1% Rule we wil be using NIO as a example

Start by selling a cash secured put and aim to collect 1% premium (we can be a bit greedy at times)

&#x200B;

Year 2021

On the 28th December I sell a 41 Put (expiry date 8th Jan) for $1.66 when Nio was about $45 range, to collect 1% we should be aiming for a $0.40 premium but as NIO is coming down and I am a bit greedy and decide to take on more risk so I collected 1.66 which is 4%. The Put Expire

On the 12th Jan I sell a 58 Put (expiry date 15th Jan)for $1.33 again if it is 1% rule I should be looking to collect $0.60 based on NIO price at that time is around $60. Greediness overtake me. NIO drop below 58 and now I am long 100 share of NIO at 58

On the 19th Jan I sell a 63 Call (expiry date 19th Jan) for 0.58 (stick to my 1% premium) the reason is if I were to get higher premium I have t o sell the call at a lower strike than I will have less upside gain. I want to score big on the upside gain. That way If I am being call out on NIO I will be able to make many more of the 1%. The call expire as NIO is below 63

On the 25th Jan I sell a 68 Call (expiry date 29th Jan) for 0.88 (slightly more than 1%. I keep my upside gain intact if i am being call out at 68. I would have gain $10 on my stock position + all the previous put call premium that I collected. The trade is still on going but look like the call will expire. And Next week I will repeat the process

&#x200B;

I did this type of trade a lot and I certainty believe NIO is bullish for this year, If my belief has change over the course of trading than I will just liquidate the stock and do it on another stock. 

&#x200B;

On a $60 stock for NIO I am currently up $400 for less than a month (that is 8% return on my capital, if I were to count using margin my return would be over 15%)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Advise 

Going for 1% premium is usually safe, when you sell a put for 1% premium on a high IV stock (NOT EBAY NOT EEM) the delta is low and most of the time the put will expire worthless, and when you get assign the stock you turn around and look for a 1% premium on the call side (that give you plenty of upside potential, you might be holding on the stock for week or month but when the run come and your stock get call away you will make more than your 1%. In anycase if you keep doing this you get to collect your 1% every week.

&#x200B;

Let think about it, if the market is up and you get assign the share you score big, if the market is up and you dont get assign for 52 week you get to collect 52% premium, and if the market tank for the year for 20% and you keep doing what I have been telling you you still get to collect 32% extra even if your stock tank 20%",1,options

&#x200B;

We all knew that today would be rough for several reasons in GME and others stonks. Those reason have been stated repeatedly or speculated on/in many places and are not ""uncomplicated."" So I'm ignoring them and isolating this day in a box of two things.

&#x200B;

1. What happened this morning was due to MUST Holdings dumping on us. ie multiple halts. If you had buy order in at $50-160 range, you know, just because ""hey you never know,"" it probably got filled. They were the ninth largest holders of $GME. This sucks, and I hate them for it, but they all so bought all those shares at $4 bucks or whatever. Still screw them and their play.
2. The second thing that happened was a large collusion by trading platforms to force a panic sell to cover shorts while the big dump occurred. Who knows what will happen with that. I'm guessing a fine, since several platforms followed suit, or some prison time at a federal club med \*cough\* I mean prison. Regardless these two things happening simultaneously caused mass chaos with people who didn't have much in the game and didn't want to lose it, and where only given one option, to sell. Super messed up. The stocks that WBS were excited about took a hit with GME because of classic and illegal fear tactics implemented in a new way imo. I lost few thousand in profits that I'm very unhappy about. 

&#x200B;

Did Melivn, Citidel, Point72 and MUST Holding's in Korea all collude with APEX to make this happen? Seems fishy considering how instrumental Korea was to the rise of bitcoin and how shorted GME was. Almost like ""here's a back up plan."" Who knows but I hope they all burn for it if its true. I'm sure there are tons of other opinions but this is what started it. If you sold well... I still think about my losses from 10 years ago and how I could have played it differently with 💎👋🏼. Those of you OG traders from the 2008-09 crash, V-wagon, 2017 hype of crypto and other massive plays know that these things happen. 💎👋🏼 If you ride them out, you bank big time (usually). Anyway, I hope you bought the dip and trying to figure out what part of the moon you want to build your $10 milly mansions on. Mine is going to be by the 🇺🇸 if it's there 😳. Luckly for me all my plays are long and I bought contracts pre-rise and todays dip. I'm curious how this will all play out. Exciting day and hopeful a lucrative one tomorrow.

828,Trying to understand GME and Options for a project,,4,l7m5p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l7m5p2/trying_to_understand_gme_and_options_for_a_project/,1611904118.0,"Hi,

I know, another GME thread. However, I have gotten a decent grasp of the situation at hand, but wanted a tuning fork (hopefully you guys) to make sure I understood things correctly.

1. Quick confirmation of my understanding of options/gamma squeeze. An option call is is a contract for a set of 100 shares by a certain expiry date in which you expect a higher strike price than the current market price. You have the right to exercise this at any time before expiration, and ITM refers to having met the target strike price or the current market price is above it. You make a profit from exercising an ITM option call as you pay strike price x 100 and sell these shares at the current market price? Once exercised, the broker is then responsible for delivering the shares to you, but if they don't have this on hand, they must buy available shares in mass regardless of the current market price, which triggers the gamma squeeze? OTM option calls are simply expired? Are Option puts the same as short selling?
2. I see conflicting information around today's buzz. I was under the impression it is due to the vast quantities of ITM option calls that can be exercised today, triggering a gamma squeeze, which may just be the final push we need for the short squeeze. However, I see people talking about Melvin and co needing to cover their shorts by today. I thought that shorts do not have an expiration date, only that the broker has the right to margin call at any time to collect their loaned shares. Any clarifications?
3. I only have a rough idea regarding the short ladder attacks/reloading shorts/doubling down on shorts in which Melvin and co. have used the last few days to drive the prices down during low volumes, any good explanations of how this works? Additionally, I don't quite understand the relationship between the short interest and their continued short ladder attacks. We seemed to have gone from \~140% to 120% shorted interest, despite the doubling down on shorts. Wouldn't the short interest increase as a result? I heard that institutions are only required to report long term shorts and not short term, is this perhaps why?
4. How do we know whether the 120-140% short interest is shorts from a while back that we expect them to take major losses from, vs shorts made more recently? It seems to that the numbers have changed, and they have continued to short, how do we know the ""make up"" of their short interest? They can cover shorts from $300 of this week than the ones they did at say $10 a year ago, what if the majority of the current short interests are these newer shorts?

I'm quite fascinated with the whole thing, and I may have to present my understandings for a project, so I'd deeply appreciate any guidance to fill in the gaps. Thank you in advanced!

&#x200B;

Let me remind you: Robinhood gets paid by large funds that want to get an information advantage and by lending out shares of retail investors. Some articles suggest that Citadel is one of Robinhood's largest PAYING clients and other articles suggest that Citadel has made a large investment in Melvin Capital. I am not saying there is a plot to bring down retail traders, but I am saying that all traders should ask serious questions about incentive structures at work here!

Robinhood therefore has a large risk if not enough shares are available. Tomorrow is an important option expiration date. Millions of shares linked to call options should change hands but I am not sure how this would work. Potentially, there aren't enough shares to allow for this and that will create a large problem not only for hedge funds that shorted those shares, but equally for the brokers that lend them those shares. Since many Robinhood retail investors hold shares in GME, I believe this is where the risk of not having enough shares is highest! 

In the last days, I argued to be very careful about the dynamics at play here. Unfortunately, my posts did not get too much attention. Again, let me highlight to all traders on all sides of this trade, but especially to retail traders:  be very careful today and tomorrow!!   


I believe that we will likely see technical problems, connectivity issues or adverse management decisions on the brokerage sides. 

What should you do: Make sure you have a strong internet connection. Make sure your portfolio is structured in a way that you can sit out any short term volatility or accessibility issues. Have additional capital unemployed and ready as backup. Do not go to extremes in terms of margin! Plus if you have several brokerage accounts in case there is an issue at one broker! 

Update today: Robinhood (""democratizing finance"" while getting paid by hedge funds) has made it impossible for retail investors to buy shares in GME and other hype stocks. While this seems not necessarily illegal, it still is remarkable and expected. Retail investors that did not pay commissions, have to pay somehow for Robinhood and currently they see what this might mean.

Investors at Interactive Brokers and other brokers get a percentage of the fee the broker gets from lending out shares. We see however, that all brokers have now increased the margin required to buy GME to 100%. This seems a fair move to me as all brokers have to manage risk. Robinhood's move to not allow further purchases of GME even if investors have plenty of funds and would only invest a small portion into GME cannot be understood from a perspective of protecting individuals, the market or the broker, only in the context of previous action at Robinhood.",15,options

Given my state of knowledge this morning, I thought a long put on GME was an obvious play. Since then, I've read a lot more about IV crush etc.

Here are the put options I bought:
$2 P for 0.60 Jan 2023
$20 P for 7.97 Jan 2022 
$50 P for 28.00 Jan 2022 

I now understand that these were not good investments due to high IV at entry, and that even though I think the stock price will plummet in the next year due to fundamentals and other reasons, the sell price of the put may also go down as IV decreases. I also recognize that for two of these options, the breakevens are below my target price, but at the time I was thinking that this didn't matter because I wasn't planning on exercising.

I never thought in a million years I’d be in a position to outright turn down $100k+ but here we are. It’s a big financial decision and while no one is a financial advisor, I could use some thoughts from some vets.

I have 3 contracts expiring tomorrow for GME 115c. My Robinhood data was glitched so I don’t know the true price of the 3 contracts at the peek at around $470 today (it showed the 3 contracts were worth 500k and that I was up 1.6million which I know isn’t right although I wouldn’t mind). I think the 3 contracts woulda been a bit north of 100k (470-115)x 100 x 3 = 106,500 and extrinsic value

Anyways I was wondering the option of exercising 1 if not 2 of them. I paid a hair less than $6k for the 3 contracts so it’d essentially buying 100 shares at $135. I do feel like the squeeze is yet to come end that a share could be $1000 if not more.

I won’t have the buying power to exercise the 2 shares unless I sell the other 1. I’m on the west coast so the options expire at noon Pst. 

What do you think would be the best move to optimize returns, assuming the squeeze has yet to be squoze. Thanks!",9,options

Before You Initiate the Transfer

Be sure to resolve any account restrictions or negative balances in your account prior to requesting a transfer, or your transfer may be delayed.

How to Initiate a Transfer

To begin the process, you'll need to contact your other brokerage and have them initiate the transfer. They’ll submit the transfer instructions to our clearing partner to transfer over your assets and funds.

NOTE
If you transfer all of your assets to another brokerage, we’ll close your account.

Please make sure you initiate an ACATS (Automated Customer Account Transfer Service) transfer. Please don’t request stock delivery using any method other than ACATS, including DTC and transfer agent transfers.

You might need to give the other brokerage your Robinhood Securities (RHS) account number. You can find this information in your mobile app:

Tap the Account icon in the bottom right corner.
Tap Investing.
Your account number will be at the top of your screen.
You may need to reference a DTC number for your transfer. Robinhood’s DTC number is 6769.

What happens after I initiate a full transfer?

After you initiate a full transfer, your account will be restricted to ensure the transfer is processed smoothly. You won't be able to make any trades on the assets being requested, including options in the underlying asset, while the transfer is in process, but keep in mind that you'll still own the securities or positions during this time, and they'll update in the app to reflect their current market value.

You may receive some assets during subsequent, residual sweep distributions. A residual sweep is the process of transferring any securities that may have remained in an account after completion of the initial ACAT transfer. Residual sweeps are common when you have unsettled trades or dividend payments at the time the ACAT transfer request is received. This process usually occurs on a weekly basis after the initial transfer is completed. You do not need to take any action to initiate these residual sweeps.

Please note that Cash Management and Robinhood Gold will be downgraded as a part of the full ACAT transfer process. If you decide to use Robinhood again, you won't be able to opt back into Cash Management at this time. You will, however, be able to resubscribe to Robinhood Gold.

What happens after I initiate a partial transfer?

After you initiate a partial transfer, your account assets being transferred will be restricted to ensure the transfer is processed smoothly. You won't be able to make any trades on the assets being requested, including options in the underlying asset, while the transfer is in process, but keep in mind that you'll still own the securities or positions during this time, and they'll update in the app to reflect their current market value. Once the partial transfer is complete, any remaining position will be unrestricted and you'll be able to resume trading of that asset.

What happens to my assets when I request a transfer?
Stocks and ETFs

Any full, settled shares should be transferred to the other brokerage. If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep.

Any options contracts you have should be transferred to the other brokerage.",15,options

It’s been a tough day, and we’re grateful to you for being a Robinhood customer. In light of the extraordinary market conditions this week, we temporarily limited buying for certain securities this morning. Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. 

This was a temporary decision made to best continue serving you, and was not an easy one to make. We know it’s led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity.

As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.

To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.

The past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone—not just institutional investors and hedge funds. We’ve seen a new generation enter the market, and they’re sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. We stand in support of you, our customers. Democratizing finance for all means giving more people access, not less.

We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and will update this Help Center article with the latest changes. We also published a blog post regarding today’s events.

Thank you again for being a Robinhood customer. We’re so grateful for your support.

Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team

funds started shorting GME years ago when the underlying was 10, 20, 30, etc.  It is these people who will potentially get squeezed.  some of these may have already covered.  But funds are continuing to short.  the difference is that the underlying with the new shorts is 300, 400, 450, etc.  these shorts will not get squeezed unless we start to moon or even mars.

the problem is the short interest data we are all going by is a) not updated frequently and b) does not indicate the underlying when short occurred.  

so yes, short interest could still be at 138%... but it could have been done at recent levels, making the exit timing very difficult or impossible if trying to time is right.

I had contracts on Robinhood that spiked to 13k at 1am on Jan 22 briefly. I don't know how I managed to do this but I didn't notice it at all. I didn't see it in my timeline until today. I know I clicked on the option and looked at the chart, but somehow I never noticed this spike from the 22nd. I ended up selling the options for 900 dollars to pay bills thinking they'd reach their potential (it was more or less my first time seeing them with gains) but I waited a few days before I sold having no idea about the after-market spike from the 22nd. Then the boost from GME, boosted the value the stock as.well. If I'd known about that spike on the 22nd. There's no way in hell I would have sold. My question is, what can I do about this in the future? I can't let this happen again no matter what. Devastating losses, I'd rather it'd had expired worthless than to past the chance of that up (for me, it's a lot of money). I think bills weren't the only part of the reason I sold, the other reason was I had two contracts expire worthless in the previous month so I think I was on edge about the last few contracts I had. 

Is there a program I can use that would alert me when this huge shifts happen? I feel like the fact that this occurred should been stressed to me a lot more. I don't remember seeing any alerts or notifications of the huge shift like I'd seen with other stocks. I didn't even consider that I'd be able to make such a silly mistake, I'm usually pretty good about stuff like that. If I have to change brokerage and pay that is okay. Maybe it's better that I pay trading fees anyway. It may force me to consider selling more carefully. I can't do this again, losses are fine and normal but not like this. If anyone has any ideas, I would love to know. This is the probably one of the dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life.",5,options

Just dropping in a quick strategic analysis on Nokia given the number of questions I'm receiving on it. The details of the discussion are applicable for the week ahead and can be found below:

**Expected move:** \+/- $3.20 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $9.70

**Lower Expected move:** $4.30

**Potential move:** \+/- $5.30 by Friday Jan 29

**Upper Expected move:** $11.80

**Lower Expected move:** $4.25

**Historical Volatility:** 49.9%

**Implied Volatility:** 362.1%

**Daily implied move:** \+/- 22.63%

**Put-To-Call Interest:** 0.23

**10-year high:** $11.75 (Feb 7, 2011)

**5-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**1-year high:** $9.79 (Jan 27, 2020)

**Bullish Trade idea:**

* Long Equity @ $6.50
* Sell $10 strike Covered Calls for Feb 5, 2021 expiration for $2.00
* Cost basis on stock: $4.50
* As long as IV remains elevated, continue selling OTM covered calls to gradually reduce cost basis
* Downside risk is to $3.30 area, which is strong support
* If the stock is called away at $10, a realized return of $10 minus $4.50 = $5.50 is generated
* Upside of $5.50 / $4.50 = 122% in just over a week

**Trade Modifications/Adjustments:**

* Purchase 1/2 desired position above
* Sell 1/2 desired position in cash secured puts at the $5 strike for Feb 5, 2021 for $0.95
* Cost basis on stock declines to $3.55, which is near support from lows seen in Nov 2020

**Other considerations:**

* Short float is low at 0.94%, which negates the potential for a short squeeze - organic buying is required to push the stock higher
* Next earnings report should occur in the next 2 weeks
* Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment
* Nokia will be a big player in 5G rollouts globally as well as IoT

:edit to include naming CITADEL in the complaint
=======

I would like to submit a complaint and a request for investigation to the senator.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them as they are on the losing side of the trade.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and it has never been a problem when retail traders are losing money to hedge funds during business as normal, but when retail traders are finally on the winning side of a trade and Wall St is finally on the losing side of a trade they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us.

I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors, namely the market maker CITADEL, who also provided a $2 billion loan to Melvin Capital, a hedge fund who was on the losing side of the trade and held short positions on these stocks, to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is a clear conflict of interest and this is market manipulation.

I am also requesting the senator to use their regulatory authority to examine why it is that Wall St fund Melvin Capital can enter trades such that one wrong trade going against them can bankrupt their entire billion dollar hedge fund, and require bail out from the other Wall St Market Maker CITADEL, who is a market maker that is supposed to transact the trades. It is a colossal failure of risk management practices at Melvin Capital, and creates massive conflict of interest for CITADEL. I am reminded of the time in 2008 when Wall St took reckless risks and as a result, when everything came crashing down, the government had to step in and bail them out, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill, and Wall St executives paying themselves multimillion dollar bonuses. There has no accountability and as an American citizen, this is not acceptable.",7,options

I looked up 1231 and found a couple meanings either good luck or a tax code which charges properties as capital gain tax. Back to the trade:

[Double Calendar Trades](https://preview.redd.it/mkl4if3ga9e61.png?width=3350&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcf53ca8f03466f6b733454a82c175e20774380)

My calculations might not be exact but it should represent the spirit of what is happening. 4 contracts were executed at the same time with different prices. These are likely long puts in the April expiration and short put in February cycle. Since the long trades will cover the short positions, the trader will only need to pay the difference in the prices which is around $3.2 million for 1,231 2/19 40puts, and 1,231 2/19 140 puts. Again, this trade is defined risk and the dealer can not lose any more than what he paid for. (This is only one of a few possible trades and in my opinion the most reasonable). 

[Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/x95upw8xc9e61.png?width=3348&format=png&auto=webp&s=80e00329a93fec9575e789e619e540bba7b2eaa1)

The blue line represents the payoff by 2/19 expiration of the short positions. I have set hypothetical stock prices at various levels and only when stock price is over $1,966 a share, does the position start to lose money. As it currently stands the position is profiting around $300k. The payoff by 2/19 expiration will be highest if stock price is around $140, at roughly $9 million (50% chance to be profit between $9 million to $300k). 85% chance to not lose money and only 10% chance to lose more than $1 million. However, even if the trade was unprofitable by the time 2/19 rolls around, 

[April Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/imnsnfwye9e61.png?width=3336&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c8235f97b6839c39915ebd09fd81b50ef37f3b)

There is currently a 62% chance that by 4/16 the stonk price will be lower than the $37 breakeven price for 2/19. And the strategy will profit over $10 million, with around 50% chance of profiting over $15 million. Have you thought of why there are still options available to be purchased? You are consuming the drug and encouraging your fellow fiends to buy more while saying the dealers should be condemned for selling them to you. Guess what, the drugs that you are consuming can be produced by a push of a button and you are playing a game without knowing the odds of winning. 

The moral of the story:

1. Apes will always lose even when you feel like you are winning
2. Short positions on options do not mean overall short positions, apes need to look beyond the immediate future
3. It would not hurt to learn about probabilities and math since that is what you are doing
4. There is roughly a 5% chance that the dealer will be busted with the punishment being a slap on the hand, but 10x the chance to make millions. 
5. Those whom you idolize might be human
6. What you see could be only half of the picture
7. What if DFV has another account with opposite positions?

Can post pic of my account below for proof. Please do your own due diligence. I have read all of the coty annual reports for the past few years, transcripts, interviews, 8k filings, i even walked to their headquarters in Amsterdam to see if it was open during the pandemic. So, when i make a bet I do a lot of research. 

I used to work at a hedge fund and one of the reasons why I quit was because I realized I was helping rich get richer. I then moved to Asia and lived there for over 8 years. I learned a lot over there and one thing I saw was how asians love brands and can be addicted to them regardless of quality, although that has changed a bit. Makeup and skincare is popular everywhere and Asians are increasing their usage of perfume too, they did not as much 10 to 15 years ago. 

Coty is the number 1 company in the world when it comes to selling perfume or fragrances. They own their own brands but also own licenses to a lot of other brands.

Covergirl
Kylie cosmetics and Kylieskin
KKW (Kim kardashian)
Burberry (license)
Gucci (license)
Adidas (license) 

Wella (40%) which includes OPI and a lot of stuff many women use at beauty salon and buy at Sally beauty supply, Walgreens etc. 

Over 60 brands which i actually think is too many which is exactly what the new ceo is going to fix. Less brands but more revenues per brand. 

There is a new ceo who was a major boss for L’Oreal for 20 years and then started her own skincare brand and after 3 years basically was acquihired to join Coty. This is the best decision ever made as the stock went from $30 to $3 on shitty management that did a lot of financial engineering and big deals that ended up costing shareholders a lot.

So, here are the catalyst as to why the february numbers are going to be outstanding. 

The company has added new distributors in europe, in fact one of the largest, that they did not have before.

13% of their sales were online or direct, that will be 20% or more this quarter which improves the top and bottom line. 

Added new team for China, which was badly needed. In fact, made a marketing deal with a top Chinese celeb and within a few hours sold out of the product they were promoting. 

New products are being launched in skincare category. 

Shitty brands are going to be sold which raises cash for the business. 

More aggressive expansion of skincare products which is going to be a faster part of the business that WallStreet is not modeling. 

I can show you why below

Revenue breakdown by product as of the last quarter was the following:
55.8% Fragrance
30.% Color cosmetics
0.3%  Hair
13.7% Skin and Beauty

Geography 
42% USA and Latin America
47% EMEA (Europe)
11% Asia Pacific

If you compare to L’Oreal which is $200 billion market cap vs. $5 Billion for Coty. 
40% Skincare
21% Haircare
18% Makeup
11% Fragrances
11% Hygiene products

Geography
42% Asia Pacific
24% North America
18% Western Europe
8% Latin America
6% Eastern Europe
3% Africa, Middle East

If you compare these businesses you can see how these are night and day. 
Asia growth is anemic for Coty at 123 mm last quarter and will be the fastest segment of the business for the next 5 years, I expect it can  grow 30% or more a year and be larger than the Americas segment. Thu is because there was little exposure given the lack of offerings in the Skincare. 

Also, beauty products are consumed more frequently than a fragrance. A perfume can last someone a month or 6 months where as a skincare product can last 1 month or maybe 2. It consists of consistent purchases which brings consistent revenues and cash flow to the business something the business needs to improve upon. 

Company has a lot of debt but have paid of $3 billion and will keep paying jt off given the higher profitability. 2.5 billion was from sale of 60% of Wella and $1 was a direct investment from KKr via a convertible bond at $6.24 conversion price. 

Stock is 65% owned by insiders and there js not a lot of shares out there to buy. So, although no squeeze there is definitely scarcity of shares.

Kylie cosmetics and kylieskin have been growing steadily since their international expansion. Ranking as the 22,500 website in the world.  Both Kylie and Kim will help them grow the cosmetics, fragrance and skincare  via a DTC offering. Those businesses by themselves are like MINI Coty’s as they can sell a lot of stuff under their brand. 

I think the comany will do 20 to 30 cents a share in earnings, wallstreet estimates are 10 to 20 and are all stuck at $6.5 price targets, except Citi which is at $10, she believes turn around is real this time. Stock is still below pre-covid price and can easily go to $10 to $15 on the turnaround taking shape.

Wallstreet is sleeping on this one. I contacted one of the top retail stock analysts, she is on cnbc a lot, and her firm does not cover the stock due to lack of institutional interest. Have LinkedIn messages to prove this but do not want to out her for business reasons. 

This is where the community can come in and buy shares today at $6.90 or options and sell them to the institutions at $15 or higher when they realize what they missed.  

I own the stock and the options. The stock I purchased at $3.33 and still hold and the option I purchased months ago as I felt that WallStreet and main street would catch on to the story but Wells Fargo put out a piece that was quite negative, they are in denial of the turnaround, and has forced consolidation of the stock for months. The reason why I picked the $7 strike js because at the time they were in the money and felt it was a safer bet than say $8 or $10 longer dated calls which started to become too expensive for the risk/reward offered.  

I own 400 contracts cost of .785 per contract with strike of $7 with February 19th as expiration. 

UPDATE 1/29/2020
I have added to my stock position from 12,500 shares to 25,000 shares and added 100 more contracts for a total of 500. 


I feel confident they will do well short-term and long-term when you see the increased growth of online traffic for all their brands online ever since they started selling directly. 

I have so much more info but I can post it in the comments.

But couldn't short sellers simply prevent this by going long on GME in the short term? 

Let's say you are short and the price is at $100 and you know you'd get a margin call if it hits $200, but you don't want to close your position. Couldn't you just buy call options with a strike price of $150? Since it's way OTM it shouldn't be too expensive and if the price hits $200 you just sell your calls and now have enough collateral to not get a margin call until it goes to let's say $400. Now you just buy another OTM call to hedge against that.

So you just stay short in the long term but you go long in the short term. This way you make money while GME goes up and you'll make money when it'll come down again.

The only way to lose money with this play would be if GME stays flat or goes up too slow, which would cause you to lose money on both your shorts and your calls. But with the way GME is currently going that doesn't seem that likely.

916,PSA spreads expiring 1/29/2020 in the meme stocks (esp GME),,8,l6wt42,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l6wt42/psa_spreads_expiring_1292020_in_the_meme_stocks/,1611841160.0,"If you have spreads or short options in any meme stock (or anything), please remember to unwind your whole position before option expiration tomorrow. Assume that there will be post 4pm moves in GME (and others) and you will be at risk for assignment (or non-assignment) on your short leg. The OCC deadline for option exercises (and contrary instructions) is 5:30pm eastern time, but brokers will have earlier cut offs.

If you cannot unwind your spread before expiration, remember you can always buy back the short leg. This neutralizes any potential risk since you are no longer short. This is especially important if you do not have the equity and willingness to accept assignment.

Remember the OCC in the money thresholds are 0.01, but the owner of an option can submit contrary instructions ('do not exercise') at any time. Exercising an option is the owner's right. If you are short an option, the only way to prevent assignment is to buy back your short (buy to close).

Questions:

* If both legs are in the money. Try to unwind the spread. Give the market maker a little bit so he takes the risk off your hand (so in a maximum $5 point spread, unwind it for $4.90 for example). You give up a little, but you do not want the headache.
* If both legs are out of the money. Consider just buying back the short leg. Pay a penny or 0.05. This is insurance so you do not have something explode against you.
* If one leg is in the money and the other is out of the money. Please make sure you UNWIND this spread because at 4pm your protective leg dies. You have to either exercise the protective leg or use stock to hedge off your risk. However, since you do not know what the holder of your short option position will do, you might get screwed. Please don't do this. It isn't worth it.

But man am I rooting for you guys and enjoying the hell out of this squeeze! For those who don't understand why retail investors are pissed and why this shot across the bow at ""inside"" institutional money to level the playing field is hitting a nerve, I have yet another reason...

It's not just the lack of institutional transparency, with dark markets, bailouts, and the like...

It's not just the crony-ism where the appointees and regulators doling out billions and trillions are from (and go back to) Goldman ...

It's also an awakening from the years of being forcibly held down and held back by the insiders club that keeps the masses last in line to the feeding trough, while they get their fill. It may help to look, in particular, how IPOs work... and its not what many people think.

By the time you and I get to buy (when the stock opens trading on the first day), all the billionaires and underwriters and institutions have had their fill. They get discounted shares and warrants. Then brokerages get their cuts, but those get doled out only to their richest clients. They all profit off of you by selling to you at markup because they had the ""members only"" opportunity to buy before you. To even be eligible for new IPO share allocations (remember, we're still talking pre-market open) you often need a 500K balance at your broker. So one can invest for decades and finally scrape enough together to hit that eligibility threshold... YOU'VE FINALLY MADE IT! YOUR TURN for some IPO shares... RIGHT? You sell some long positions to free up money for your new IPO shares. Not so fast...

Ah, but alas, its a made up number. Its a joke. You wake up to zero shares. The only ones who get shares allocated are the fattest of fat cat clients, because the brokers get to CHOOSE who gets the shares. No regulation there, so that its fair to you and me. They aren't allocated in proportion to interest or even to account balance. The big guys get ALL the shares. All before the first trade takes place. The rest get exactly none. You and I have to then buy them off the ones that got them at a huge discount, most just hours prior to going on the market. Once the stock opens trading, the fat cats who've gotten their fill of shares are making an instant 50%, 100%, 200% off of the retail investors who can only buy when the trading starts.

Tell me how that is OK, but retail investors squeezing the fat cats' shorts isn't?! For anyone complaining or wanting to halt trading, remember that at least this battle between longs and shorts is taking place on the FREE AND OPEN MARKET, not in back rooms, not as favors to clients, not by gaming built-in rules that allow only the richest to get the good gains at the expense of retail. No, none of that. With GME, the long buys and shorts and open options interest and float are visible and tracked and its all in the open market in real-time. The winners did it by taking risk and seeing an opportunity and having steady hands while being on the right side of over-extended shorts by the hedge funds. There is no sweetheart deal BS. And they did it despite trading halting because some insiders lost some money for once and had their buddies halt trading, and are calling for it again.  
 They can't fathom that they took a loss for once, and all because of these ""moron retail"" dogs. Don't even get me started on eligibility requirements to participate in private equity round investment. But there is hope....

""Retail"" has started taking control over the abuses of fiat / monetary policy by centralized (and often corrupt) authorities who control the money supply... We've done it via cryptocurrency, open ledgers, and DAOs. Institutional money ignored us and laughed off blockchain, but has caved and, being scared, is now wanting to hedge their bets by getting in on some of it.

The rise of ICOs and SPACs and direct-to-market IPOs have started to cut out at least some layers of the IPO Ponzi pyramid. Still a way to go here.

Broker fees have been forced to zero by Robinhood and the democratization of market access, options trading, and fractional shares.  Nice work.  But the shit Robinhood pulled today was unadulterated favoritism, selective manipulation that hurt real people and is unacceptable.  More to be done here.

We now need to demand that we have equal access to opportunity like pre-market private equity investment and IPO allocations... our money is just as good as the rich money, and should be treated as such... or else GME squeezes will continue to happen. It can keep going all day every day when retail spots a hedge squeeze to force, if need be. When you're hungry and tired of being held back from the trough while others get their fill, eventually enough is enough. Hey institutions... Either you can reform the IPO process and the other ""we eat first"" schemes, or they will be torn down, targeted by the ""retail morons"" you look down on, circumvented, innovated around, and you'll be left holding the empty bags of fiat, shuttered hedge funds, and a huge tab for your squeezed short sales.

The following interaction just terrified me:

* An OP posted an argument bullish on GME dependent on data inconsistent with Bloomberg
* I commented with the numbers showing on my screen
* They seemed convinced they had the right data and provided a screenshot as a source
* I DMed them to figure out where the inconsistency was, it was far from the first time I'd seen data services have conflicting numbers but I wanted to figure out where the discrepancy was
* They told me they don't know where the number or screenshot came from but provided a link to a financial blog article with ""a time series chart which agrees"" and claimed ""other"" unspecified sources also agreed
* I asked OP to edit their post to mention that they don't know where the number that their argument depended on comes from and that a reputable source had another figure
* They declined
* That post is still up and underinformed people reading it may make decisions that affect their lives based on it

**To be clear, I don't know that the number they provide is wrong but I do know where the number I provide came from and if the number isn't basically 1 in reality it invalidates the OP's entire argument.**

I want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. 

So be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: 

Shorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. 

Remember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. 

Side-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. 

This right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. 

So just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀 

TLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.",353,options

TLDR: You can buy any dollar amount of GME you are willing to lose on Robinhood in order to be a part of Economics history and to send a message to Wall Street that they can't mess with the little guys any more

GME might not be about making tendies any more. Now it is about what GME tells Wall Street. Every dollar you put into GME now holds risk, but the eyes of the world are on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and GME right now. Wall Street is learning they can't mess with retail investors and every dollar you buy and hold with shows them that. This is already going to the highest levels of government and is getting the eyes of the world. What happens next is a demonstration that the people who only have stimulus checks to invest are still people who matter and people who have a voice.

If you are willing to lose $5, $10, $100, or $1,000, then right now any amount you put into GME says more than any petition on [Change.org](https://change.org/) ever will. You have to be ready to lose it all, so know that.

$10 x 4.1M degenerates = 140,410.95 more shares that say GameStop matters, business bullied by Wall Street matter (aka Tesla), and that the people matter. This could mean the end of naked short-selling for good and could mean the end of bullying small hard-working businesses out of existence forever. This will change federal policy

its a story about market makers. the funds who sit between you and your counter-party in a stock trade, both in space and time. the funds that make orders so when you want to buy $1000 worth of stupid OTM calls, you can. they used to make money like superman 3/the office: skim little bits off the top.

right now basically all market-makers for retail options are hedge funds. it wasn't always this way. this happened after banks got out of the business during low volatility (which means low spread, where market makers have historically made their money). they declared it unprofitable and said they didn't have the tech for it. maybe that's true. and maybe they were also too regulated to do whatever the hedge funds could do do. time period: 2018-2020.

fast forward to today: the hedge funds now playing at options market-making are doing something that's illegal in other first world countries: paying your brokerage to send them your flow. they provide a service to your brokerage, and they pay your brokerage to do so. as we have all learned from facebook, if you don't pay for the product, you're the product.

as a result they can monitor the market, and front-run: make their own moves before executing your trades. don't get too worked up; your brokerage probably does this too, before they even send the orders in. you are feeder fish.

normally market-makers have to keep their positions neutral to be safe. that means if they sell you a call position, they don't sell it naked -- they have to buy stock to cover. but this takes a ton of money. a retail move of $1k into an options play could force a market-maker to hold $50k, $200k, or more of the underlying stock as they delta-hedge as the price goes up. this clearly requires a ton of capital. wouldn't it be incredible if someone could make markets in a new way that didn't require this?

you can see how, as a regulated bank, you would be at a disadvantage to these ""technological innovations"". if your unregulated competitor didn't have to buy $50k in stock to neutralize the $1000 in options they just sold, they might be able to beat you on price. now they have $200k they can put into options strategies, while you the bank are basically being dragged around by the nose by some retard who used his stimulus check to force you into a quarter-million-dollar position.

you could see how market makers might make an argument that worst case, they could cover using options strategies, at a fraction of the cost of owning stock. they are hedge funds, after all. back to this in a second.

but heres the thing. most brokerages aren't stupid. they'll send mms fraction of their flow, but not their whole flow, because they want the data and they don't want mms seeing everything. they also don't want mms having fulfillment or technical issues and taking down their whole platform. they maintain alternatives. some of them even do their own market-making.

a couple of hedge guys see an opportunity. they agree to create a brokerage and sell flow to their hedge fund market maker buddies exclusively. in return their buddies pay them more for their flow, and they execute their trades slower. fine, whatever, it's a discount brokerage. ""I know, we'll really get these plebs going and name it ""robinhood"", haha, so we can fuck them while we're fucking them.""

they realize if they do this, they can also do something other brokerages can't or won’t: trade fractional shares. if I'm a standard brokerage sending my customer orders to several market-makers, they all would have to support fractional shares or I can't feed those orders through the same process. now the poor people can literally invest their lattes. oh and they're not gonna do the math to see how hard we fucked their fractions. ka-ching.

maybe you're starting to see the problem. or maybe you’re bored and can skip ahead. but anyway: because the only people who can afford to make markets now are hedge funds. so robinhood's market-maker is also a hedge fund. and they took up a short position in a stock. it's what hedge funds do. big fucking position because everyone's doing it and obviously video games don't get bought in person anymore and retail is dead. bc downloads and amazon and covid. too many people sell short but it doesn't matter if it's oversold if video game store goes bankrupt. we all know this. it’s only part of the problem. 

at the same time, your buddies with the brokerage can use that same stock as a ""gift"" for new customers who are super grateful: ""the fuck is this. gamestonk? I got in here to bet cappuccinos on TSLA."" so they sell, spreading the sell data into retail and driving the price down more. shorts ftw. 

meanwhile: some deep fucking retard on reddit sniffs out burry's move against the shorts and gets on board. starts posting boring shit about how he's not making any money. does this every month for like a year. gets made fun of. then starts losing money. gets made fun of more. then cohen buys in. then bankruptcy is off the table. makes a little, gets told to sell. doesn't. then earnings carnage takes everything. gets made fun of. doesn't sell.

then he starts making money. then a lot of fucking money. then more people realize the story checks out. they buy otm calls and shares using retail platforms. orders routed to hedge fund. hedge fund is like haha, these retards, i'll have my lemon party buddy schedule a ""why this is stupid"" webinar and the price will dive. but he's too inept to run a webinar. huh.

enter: the return of volatility. 

and not just normal volatility, but really, really, one-sided volatility. and only on your shorts. suddenly, while market makers make options markets for retail, retail isn't making them for mms. they can't balance the retail calls with other options strategies to save their life. the balance of trade that made their strategy work is gone.

so they're back to standard market-making practices, right? nope. they don't have the capital or the desire to do that. so they get more desperate and creative. start selling more shares short because clearly the price can't keep going up. maybe they get loose with the definition of ""closed our short position"" and now it just means they personally feel like they creatively covered your potential losses. but naked shorts have a funny reality: while your gains are capped, you can lose infinite money.

and what the fuck it keeps happening. they have to do something. other market makers start covering. cue gamma squeezes.

but the price will come down. there's no reason for this price.  ""we won't cover. we'll take up more short positions higher up. it will come down and we'll be fucking black. haha these fucking plebs. sell ladders with our friends. come on friends!!""

but it doesn't work. the losses mount. your friends lending you your leverage start to realize something is up. they check in with you. your paper losses are insane. but to fix the situation you'd have to close out basically everything and that would be a $500B shit on the market. your buddies don't want that, your lender doesn't want that. they also don’t want to hold those shorts. and your big customers are just as badly off. so competitors lend each other money. collusion? fuck it, we're dead if we don't. get rich or die trying.

overheard at schwab (owns tdameritrade): ""wait, are we still market-making? did we loan money to any of these market makers?""

in the robinhood engineering meeting: ""hey guys, people are talking about citadel getting fucked. but they're the only ones who support our integration to sell fractional shares, so even if we had set up alternatives, which we didn't (because startup), we can't trade this stuff anywhere else."" 
“uhhhhh fuck. start closing positions. i don’t care. now.”

maybe no other brokers have this particular issue because worst case they can send it direct to the markets. that might be rough, but not as rough as not being able to close positions with citadel gone. robinhood probably can’t ipo without these guys. maybe ever. 

data point:
robinhood has (allegedly) done something illegal today
when a startup visibly does something they know is illegal, right before a planned ipo, it is not to save their buddies money (because hey they're sociopaths to begin with) but because something much worse is happening. it is because of an existential threat

data point: 
td ameritrade has removed sell limits if the limit is too high. this appears to be so they can lend your shares (to the shorts/market makers), which they could not do with a sell limit set. 

data point:
when you hear about a loan from one competitor to another, and they announce it, that should tell you a couple of things:
one, desperation. both parties. that probably means collusion. a common enemy. a serious threat.
two, other people are afraid. why else announce it at all? their investors and brokers are freaked the fuck out bc they know something more is wrong than buddies coming down.
three, $1.5B is not enough to cover, is it? they must 10x this via leverage and then apply? or maybe it is enough to keep away the margin call.

data point:
large GME sale announced publicly during trading day, while shutting down the buy side. articles saying ""you can make money, but only if you sell""
these guys have been calling everyone they know trying to relieve pressure before tomorrow. apparently no one domestic agreed to do it so they had to go offshore. i wonder if they offered an off-market deal to make this sale happen

data point:
the hedge funds are leveraged at least 10:1 with margin provided by someone
citadel is the largest but there are 10ish of them making markets
whoever is providing this margin would normally just force a margin call. but maybe they can't bc it would force closing of e.g. $500B (10x leverage minimum) in positions per fund they force. that would in turn drive prices down, triggering other margin calls. the ten funds involved in market-making could be $5T market $ assuming they haven't gone beyond 10x leverage.

962,"Update on long-gamma options play for semiconductor supply shortages: INTC, AMD, CAJ",,2,l6yefo,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l6yefo/update_on_longgamma_options_play_for/,1611845077.0,"[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l4s8bx/semiconductor_options_play_for_amd_and_caj/) I wrote about how I'm long INTC calls vs long AMD puts, alongside long CAJ calls. AMD and CAJ reported this week. So far, the trade is going well and I think there's a lot of juice left in it.

AMD beat but acknowledged some inventory tightness. [Here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) is a transcript of the call.

Canon reported overnight (3pm Tokyo time), [here (PDF)](https://global.canon/en/ir/conference/pdf/conf2020e.pdf) is the slideshow. They beat their sales and profit projections. Operating profit for the ""Industry and Others"" segment, which includes lithography equipment for chips and flat-panel displays, grew by 470% YoY (slide 30). The ADR is trading in-line with last night's (pre-earnings) Tokyo price action, and it hasn't moved much as a result of new information in the earnings release. The local stock (Tokyo 7751) doesn't open until after US market close. I rolled from the Feb 22.5c to the Feb 25c and Mar 30c yesterday, and may add more today.

As I mentioned, AMD's Lisa Su said AMD had been affected by semiconductor shortages on the earnings call during Q&A:

>Certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. We saw a strong revenue ramp in our business, as well as across some of our peers. It's fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning.  
>  
>As a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily I would say in the PC market, the low end of the PC market, and in the gaming markets. That being said, I think we're getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels.  
>  
>And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there's added capacity in the second half. And then as in terms of how we -- how we think about these things, so for our full-year annual guide, we do have good visibility on both the demand side and the supply side.

So now I am long the 05Feb INTC 56 call, the 05Feb AMD 89.5 put, the CAJ Feb 25 call, and the CAJ Mar 30 call. I like being long vol in this environment, and the cross-currency exposure is also positive in the event of a flight to safe-haven yen. I think the market hasn't fully absorbed how big of an impact the semiconductor shortages will have on the relative valuation between IDM and fabless chipmakers, but several companies (chiefly TSMC) discussed capex toward semiconductor fab buildout as part of their earnings presentations, and the shortage is a headline-making problem for multinational automakers, so I believe that the market is indeed starting to recognize the opportunity in semiconductor fab.",2,options

The day has come. While these days are painful for long term holders, and really take a low blow out of our portfolios, we are presented with a buying opportunity. This was the worst day for the S&P500 since October 28th pull back. Looks like we were right about a correction of 3-5%. Like I said, the good news is we can buy a lot of stock that we were eyeing now at a great discount. The bad news is, the market could keep pulling back. This is a very big earnings week. A lot of times, investors will pull out before the earnings reports come out and buy back later. If we can get through this week without taking much more losses, I'd call it a win.

**$AMC- +275%**

In case you haven't noticed, I am making these picks before the huge gains.

It was a tough day for my portfolio. My portfolio is down 10%, or $70,000. This is why I said to play carefully with the 3x. While they can go up by 3x, they also go down by that much. Overall, I'm satisfied to keep holding them as I can stomach the temporary loss. I've been in crypto since 2011 so I'd like to think I'm use to these kind of losses (and more).

**Adding to Watchlist:**

**$NOK** \- This has been added to my watchlist since I saw it start trending on the internet as of recently. I picked this one just like I did AMC before they exploded. This one still has room to grow, and it will be in the news now. Tread carefully; this is the higher risk level play. I'd put a couple hundred, or thousand on some short term OTM calls. Or, sell covered calls on the way up.

* Target Price: $10
* Entry: <$6
* Risk: 5

""The company is led by **CEO and Chairman Klaus Kleinfeld**, who previously served as CEO of NEOM, Arconic, and Alcoa. He is joined by **CFO Thomas Stapp**, whose previous roles include serving as an Associate Partner at Bain & Company and a Principal at Oliver Wyman."" I see this SPAC doubling when some rumors start emerging of who they will be merging with. Hold some commons.

* Entry: $10
* Risk: 4
* Timeframe: 1-2 months

In a situation like this, rules go out the window. These people are not going to just accept this. There is a good chance that we see trading halted on GME at a critical point around options expiration, most likely either this week or next. In the event that trading is halted as your options expire, you are locked in to them and you have to choose at the expiration point whether or not you want to execute.

YES my account is new, but that’s simply because I’ve stayed away from Reddit in the past. I was recommended to try reaching out on here by a friend, haha. So I know this may be viewed as a really lame thing to do, and generally I’d feel the same. To be totally honest with you, this is unfortunately one of my last resorts right now. So for starters let me introduce myself. My name is Kayla, I’m 19 years old at the moment and currently renting from a distant friend of mine here in Wisconsin. As also true for many others and I’d assume you, I have really been struggling recently. I did have a low key job awhile back, but as you mentioned for you that was shut down this year. I’ve gotten to this point in my life where it feels like I have nothing left to go for it, almost as if I’m in a ditch without a shovel. Now I’m not saying any of this to make you feel bad for me, it’s simply part of my story. So earlier this year when everything really started to take a turn for the worst, that’s where I struck and interest in investing. Now the funny thing is I’ve never put a single dollar into the stock market, but I’ve still found so many ways to enjoy it. I’ve heard so many horror stories, yet I’ve spent all year studying and learning about it. Of course like many of us it started as somewhat of a get rich quick thing, but now I’ve really come to learn it’s so much more than that. Now what does this have to do with anything? Well I’ve found this love for the stock market and genuinely feel like I’d do great, but it has been so long since I’ve even had some spare change to my name. With a loss of a job, limited education, little help from my parents, and overall some terrible circumstances it has been hard. So you can probably guess what I’m getting at, I could really use some help. Now I know how ridiculous messaging a stranger on Reddit for support seems, but this really is a last resort. I feel so lost and hopeless, but at the same time I feel like I’ve found my path and just need the help getting to where I want to be. I’ve never been one to beg, but what can I do. It just seems like my worth ethic has been beat by unfortunate circumstances. I could really use a blessing right now, and I come with the best intentions when I say that. I just want to get out of this seemingly endless hole. I want to put a decent meal on the table for once, I want to pay my rent on time this coming month, and so much more. I really don’t expect anything and I’m likely wasting my time by even typing this, but I’m the definition of desperate right now. What may seem like nothing to some of you could be life changing for another, and I could really use it. Even simply someone to talk to to or help advise and support me would be great. Again I know this sounds ridiculous, but maybe I’ll just find the right person on here. Something so small to you could be huge for me, so please keep me in your consideration if you’re ever feeling the need to help someone. Also I’m not talking anything crazy, but it all adds up.

There has also been very high open interest in buying puts. This is no surprise because puts limit your downside, while short selling does not. For a GME bear, puts are clearly the safer bet.

**Summary of what caused the gamma squeeze last Friday 1/22 (skip ahead if you know this):**

The share price jumped up naturally from people buying  shares, right as most of the higher strike call options were about to expire OTM on Friday. This meant that 0dte OTM calls could be bought for almost nothing. Some people recognized the insane social media support developing on Reddit, and made heavy bets on those 0dte OTM calls before the organic price surge.

Well, their bets proved to be correct when the share price rose above a key price level (I forget the exact number), where there was an extremely high concentration of open interest due to all the 0dte buying.

Once  this key level was passed, OTM calls became ITM, delta increased rapidly, and banks were forced to buy up shares rapidly to hedge. The share price rose rapidly as a result.

**How this could be relevant soon:**

So let's say the GME squeeze gets squozed, most people take profits as planned, and the share price returns to Earth from Alpha Centurai. As put strikes are passed on the way down, delta will go further negative, and banks will be forced to sell shorts to hedge these puts, driving share price further down.

If that sharp GME price decline happens on a Friday when 0dte OTM puts are available, the conditions for a reverse gamma-squeeze could very well be present. My gut says that the conditions aren't exactly right for this to happen, but I'm not sure.

A couple of open questions:

*  Are the availability of cheap 0dte OTM options a required condition for a gamma squeeze? And could an already-high concentration of puts at key strike prices be a substitute for that?
* How will the high IV this week affect the likelihood of a reverse gamma-squeeze?",3,options

As far as I know, the ideal situation is selling the assigned stocks immediately and selling the long option as well. 

However, I don't understand how this prevents major losses, as the stock price can change drastically between the time of assignment and the time when you actually notice you got assigned and decide to do something about (perhaps you had diarrhoea and were stuck for 2 hours on the bathroom). If we look at an extreme case, let's take gamestop.

To report earnings on Feb. 2nd 
Consensus Estimate ~ $7/share
Whisper Number ~10/share 

Amazon will report fiscal Q4 earnings next week. Q4 will include Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas shopping and for the first time ever Prime day. Prime Day was delayed from July to October in 2020. That will add ~10 billion in additional revenue for the quarter. I expect them to do ~125 billion in revenue and produce earnings of about 14/share, doubling the consensus estimate. 

Note* Unlike some of these stocks that are at all time highs going into their reports, Amazon has trended sideways for months providing a technical setup more in line with Netflix leading up to their report. 

Key Points:

- Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit 10.4 billion globally over the two-day period spanning Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, up from $7.16 billion during the 48-hour event in July 2019.

- Independent businesses selling on Amazon surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Amazon said, noting that the figure was up 60% from last year

- Amazon reported a record breaking shopping season that saw more than 1.5 billion toys, electronics and household goods delivered. 

- Amazon added 30 million prime members in 2020 

- AWS will be impressive as Amazon has captured almost 50% of the entire cloud infrastructure market. At the re:Invent conference in December, Andy Jassy said, “When you look back on the history of the cloud, it will turn out that the pandemic accelerated adoption by several years.”",5,options

The rocket that all of you are hyping about has gone the way of the Shuttle Columbia.

I get it, sticking it to the big bully is fun, but shooting yourself through the head in the hopes that he’ll get hit is stupid. Now is as good a time as ever to put money into puts for GME. Hell, at this point 0 day expiry puts are looking like perfect 10s right now.

On Friday of last week we had a squeeze because there weren't enough shares purchased by the MMs to cover their call contract positions because basically WSB kept buying the contracts (in addition to shares, but to a more major extent the contracts.)  We know this.  This Friday is expected to be the big ""War"" between MMs/shorts and retail WSB.

The thing is there are contracts being sold right now with strikes of 100, 200, 300.  All of which are in the money.  But not everyone who has bought these contracts has 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 so they will HAVE to liquidate their position for the 1/29 contracts come Friday.  All brokers do it differently but the flavor of choice is Robinhood who will auto sell your position you cannot afford at about 3:00pm to 3:05 that Friday.  This.. we also know.

My question is:  What happens when literally hundreds of THOUSANDS of contracts start getting flushed out at bid pricing?  The bid does go down, but how far?  Who will actually buy?  Will the MMs be forced to buy the contract? **Can it go below strike intrinsic value?**

That last question is the most important if so, because if MMs start buying below intrinsic value, they don't need to hold on to as many shares to cover the position, especially if THEY HOLD THE CONTRACT.  So they sell the shares associated... and well you see where I'm going with this.

1018,The art of the Covered CALL (a safer way to gamble) :-),,56,l66izy,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l66izy/the_art_of_the_covered_call_a_safer_way_to_gamble/,1611760502.0,"**Episode 1: A safer way to invest in Options; The Covered CALL**

Options can be a great way to make (and lose) a lot of money very quickly but one of the safer ways to work with Options, is to own and hold at least 100 of the Shares you are taking an Option position on and then get paid to do so – you can still lose of course, but provided you ‘like’ and believe in the Stock you own it’s a great way to make extra income whilst holding onto the Stock.

So how does it work?

**Covered CALL (locking in your potential profit)**

First, you identify a quality Stock to purchase, one that you think has upside potential (not a flash in the pan type Stock) and then if you don’t already own it, purchase a minimum of 100 shares in that company (equivalent to 1 Option);

*N.B: As stated in the opening, this Stock wants to be one you like and are happy to purchase at the current price (or already own) but want to earn some extra income as part of the ‘ride’*

Buy at least 100 shares of it or the Stock in multiples of 100 as each represents 1 Option

Next, sell a CALL on the 100 (or more) shares you own but at a higher valuation than its current price, so if you purchased the Stock at $3.00 for example, then a typical CALL might be sold at $3.25/$3.50 or maybe even $3.75 or above.

*Here’s the good bit; You will get paid directly for selling this CALL and the money added to your Brokerage account immediately :-)* *and you still own the Stock!!*

Now, on the date that the Option expires, if it’s value is below the price specified in the CALL, you get to keep the Stock and the money you received when you sold the CALL – how cool is that? :-) However, if on the other hand the stock has rocketed and is now worth (say) $6.00, you will have to forgo the extra profit and sell it to the owner of the Option for the price agreed in the CALL ($3.25/3.50/3.75?) but don’t worry, on the date of expiration your brokerage will automatically transfer the Stock to the new owner if these conditions are met, so you won’t need to do anything and you have earnt good money both in the uptick of the Stock price and the money you received when you sold the CALL.

So what’s the catch?

Remember I said that this needs to be a Stock you like and want to keep? Well now let’s take the other side; imagine the Stock falls in value; maybe a lot :-( your Covered CALL effectively locks you into holding those Shares until expiration (unless of course you buy the CALL back , but this defeats the main point of the Covered CALL, as when you buy it back you will have to repay some, all or more money than you were paid depending on the CALLS value at the time :-) ) . So lets assume you follow the plan and end up still holding a $3 Stock at the expirey of the Option but which is now trading at $2.25 - does this matter? Well, if this Stock is a great company, and you know it’s going places then who cares? Maybe even double down on it (although this is extremely risky unless you have an awful lot of money to play with), but even in this situation, as you like the Stock and are in it for the long term, the temporary devaluation should have been significantly offset by the CALL money you received at the beginning of the transaction and you can sit tight until it returns to $3 ++ and/or sell another Covered CALL to make some more income whilst you wait!! Not only that, as most CALLS can be bought say one month forward, you can keep repeating this trade taking the income each and every month as long as you continue to own the stock!

Next week I’ll try and do an article on selling PUTS and how (if you've got a margin account) you can use this as an ownership strategy in a descending market or, for profit in an ascending market. Finally in episodes 3 and 4 I'll try and cover off the much famed ‘Naked’ buying of CALLS and PUTS and critically how you can potentially use a PUT to offset shares you own from downside losses and of course in episode 5 we'll do 'swing trading' to finish off.

If enough shorts need to unwind their leverage, and other funds also need to unwind a bit, then we will see increasing volatility over the next week or so. Or at least north of 30. 

It didnt really help that volatility was cheap up until a week ago and that we are due for a correction to begin with. There was a ton of selling pressure late yesterday to take us below 3750.

So it is definitely possible that 3858 was the top. If one or two highly leveraged funds need to regroup, then we are looking at a gap down day. GME will come down within a month or so but the near dated expiration is still incredibly overleveraged and the gamma risk will be stupid.",16,options

GME has become much harder to borrow with the rates to borrow going up.  This means you are at more risk then usual for early assignment on deeper in the money short calls.

If you are assigned early you will have to pay hard to borrow fees until the position is covered.

If you see your short call is trading with no extrinsic value,  you may want to cover your position.

&#x200B;

Edit to ADD:

Sorry, haven't been able to respond to all questions.

When I say short call, I don't mean just naked short.  If you have a call vertical, a call butterfly, or any spread with a short call you are at risk of early assignment.

If you have been assigned on a short call from a spread, you can either exercise your long call or close the position as a spread (you would place an order to buy the stock you were assigned and sell out your long call).  If there is no extrinsic value left in your long call, easiest is to exercise.  If there is extrinsic value left do the latter.

Make sure your broker hasn't closed out the position for you before you act.

Edit again:  I added that your risk in early assignment is for short calls.  Didn't put this in at first as you can't be assigned on long calls so I didn't think it was necessary, but for those who didn't realize this, this clarifies.",663,options

It seems like a win win no matter what. The cost of entry is bare minimum and the upside is infinite no matter which way the stock moves as long as it isn't sideways. Which isn't going to happen.

All calls that aren’t exercised will just be exercised by brokers and sold at market and the MMs will have the shares to do this because of delta being basically equal to 1. Would all the selling of these shares at market drive price up, or would it even drive price down due to limited buyers at higher prices and the brokers being forced to sell for whatever market price is available?

Short squeezes happen all the time, most are very subtle and quick, they never make the news and are over before you know it. It can be profitable if you know how to hop on one. The recent case is an unusual one, I knew it was out of control when my friends, who don’t trade or know much about the market, start asking about buying this stock.

When the shorts are covering a few things happen:

1. Longs/Algos Exit: Many Algo’s and funds ride the squeeze, this is an active strategy in the street. As shorts cover, the Longs will provide the liquidity for the shorts to exit their position. Retail who are in the move can also take their profits.
2. Institutions Trim: Though the narrative paints institutions/funds as the enemy, they are in fact the biggest holders, and by default/and by luck, are in the short squeeze from the beginning, Once it gets out of hand, they can decides to trim their position. Institutions don’t hit the market sell button to cause panic, rather they distribute into strength. If enough bid is still there, then the price will hold up.
3. The nail in the coffin: Secondary Offering: Though the stock is being traded like roller coaster, it is still a business and the management has obligation to run it. Businesses go public to raise capital to fund their operations, what better way to raise capital than do an offering when the valuation is sky high.

I wound’t be surprised if the company does the largest secondary offering ever, enough to fund is operations for at least a decade. This is practically free money, since it has a lot of new “investors” believing in their business, The company now has the capital available to fulfill its liabilities and expand its business.",4,options

I have the front expiry, 257.5 puts. Like AMD, I didn't take the short call side because I like them both to the upside and don't want to manage short calls. Looking at tomorrow, both CAT and CVX are reporting. I think both of these look interesting so I intent to re-visit them before the close tomorrow.

Been trying to find it online and have read quite a lot on Delta but have yet to figure out the exact relationship between Delta & Intrinsic Value.

So assuming we have a 50C option with the underlying share currently trading at $55, intrinsic value would be $5 and this goes directly to the options premium. Should the share increase by $1, intrinsic value would again increase by the same to $1 and the option premium would also increase by $1. Few quick ones:

1/ Where does Delta come in with it's value ranging from 0.5-1 given ITM? How does it contribute to the intrinsic value? 2/ Am I correct to understand that a $1 increase in intrinsic value does not equal to $1 increase in the Options Premium/Price? 3/ Given Delta measures the magnitude of increase in Options Price for an increase in the price of the underlying, wouldn't Delta always equal $1 (given intrinsic value increases by $1)?

There are retail traders and institutions that are LONG GME shares and what that means for their brokers. On the other hand, there are institutions SHORT GME shares and SHORT GME calls and their brokers, often called prime brokers. 

Most retail investors and WSBers have their investments likely at Robinhood, which is famously a no-commission brokerage but makes money lending out shares of their clients. 

Interactive Brokers might also have many clients with substantial number of shares of GME. Here, usually shares can be lend to institutions and the fee gained by doing so will be split between IB and the clients holding the shares. 

Then there are other brokerages that do not lend out the shares held by their clients. Depending on the country, this can be forbidden or clients can approach their broker to disallow any onward lending of their shares and thus reduce the shares available to short GME. 

Hence: the current environment is potentially extremely profitable for Robinhood who is at the center of lending GME shares. But: There is also a certain risk associated with this. 

On the other side of the trade, shortsellers, like Melvin, usually use several prime brokers who then provide shares to them to sell. These prime brokers might get these shares from other brokerages and onlend at a certain rate. I am not sure if Melvin has direct access to Robinhood - I actually highly doubt this. There is some speculation about who the prime brokers for Melvin are. I do not know but a little internet search will yield some very large names. If a shortseller in GME can't owner their requirements, the brokerage will be on the hook. 

Hence: the prime brokerages of GME shortsellers will likely have emergency meetings now. Plus: there are likely different brokerages involved in terms of where retail investors hold their portfolios and with whom hedge funds trade. In other words, it is not just one connected party, but might lead to ripple effects in financial markets.

Background: Takeda is a pharma company old as time based in Japan. They completed a pipeline acquisition of Shire in 2019 and the company has been effectively ""dead"" money since then.

The Big Investment: Cathie Woods (The Queen) famous for $TSLA and other growth plays has recently been purchasing $TAK hands over fists the past few weeks. This is now a top 10 holding in their ARKG fund and is most likely the largest holder of the ADRs (Japanese listed). Here is the link to the holdings of the fund. [https://ark-funds.com/arkg](https://ark-funds.com/arkg)

Follow the Flow: Options flow has been heavy before and after the big ARKG purchases. Where Cathie goes, so do others.

Catalysts: Pharma companies in any stage have catalysts and the capital flow in to the company suggests that these catalysts are going to have some positive outcomes. The company has an investor day this Friday (January 29th) during the World Conference on Lung Cancer (which they also have a drug for in the pipe), earnings report on Feb 4, and an FDA approval that is expected to be announced imminently. They should start to reap the benefits of the Shire acquisition in 2021 and expect to see that in the earnings. In addition, they have numerous COVID-19 dealings regarding the vaccine and treatment.

The Trends: Pharma is making a comeback in a big way and will continue to do so under the new political administration in the US. I am going to leave politics out of this, but the previous was not kind to big pharma and it is expected to do very well under the new. Longer the base in the chart, the more explosive the growth potential, that is real. (this is a real stock, not a meme over on WSB so don't go looking up short float, it has none).

I have also provided a short thesis for the attention deficit FinTwit crowd that provides some ancillary detail not provided here. [https://twitter.com/crisroths/status/1353880127390756864?s=21](https://twitter.com/crisroths/status/1353880127390756864?s=21)

TLDR: TAK is becoming a Cathie Wood ARK favorite and in a very short time frame has amassed over 19m shares or $350m in notional value. Following the option flow and the big money trades with catalysts in the near term to boot, I took a sizable position at Feb 19, Jun 21, and Jan Leaps 22.5 to capture value and force myself to stay in the trade as this is a short and long term play.

So I'm reposting it here to see if we could get a good discussion going:

I'd like to get the opinion of some people who understand the economics and math of this.

The actors:

1. Retail traders with deep ITM calls that can't afford to exercise.
2. Market makers that are delta neutral
3. Shorts that are hedged with calls.
4. Shorts that are not well hedged that are holding on for dear life.

What is going to happen to this clusterfuck on Thurs/Fri? Could we see something at shallow ITM strikes similar to what happened to oil where futures prices went negative? A massive negative feedback loop where retail sells their ITM calls, picked up by algos who exercise and liquidate? Algo's exercising and holding to force even more of a squeeze?

There's some funky shit thats gonna happen and i'd like to be in the right place for it. I'm leaning towards a huge liquidation where the smart money starts to exit either EOD today or Thursday due to the threat of retail traders flooding the market with deep ITM calls which will get picked up by institutions that will liquidate immediately.

Colonel after today. All you paper hands should be ashamed with yourself, but you still have time to help your fellow brothers against the Big Bad, Melvin Capital.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

**Conjectures**

I'll describe how Melvin Capital will likely try to countermove their weak position. Everything I write is conjecture, and would be a very low investable thesis but let's continue with the white boarding.

The GME 60C is the beginning and the end for you guys. Huge amounts of call buying and delta hedging occured at this strike. 10s of Millions of shares are linked to these derivatives.

Melvin's Capital goal is to not be forced into a short squeeze. You guys want the the infinite short squeeze to be triggered. MM/Citadel Securities provides the price discovery on how expensive each countermove is for the actors in this game.

Melvin Capital is likely not to double down on naked shorts with the new funds because if he loses in that move, Plotnik's career is over and may face criminal charges for abusing his fudiciary duties by doubling down with more naked short selling.

We saw today how someone forced GME share price to drop over 10% and force halts, thereby dropping off vega and killing off any gamma ramping. It happened over and over. So we know that's what they tactically want to do.

Steve Cohen's, famous hedge fund manager, has a favorite play. He would create massive call and put walls around a strike price to kill off vega and prevent gamma, and collect premium. In ELI5, Cohen would put up massive blocks of expensive puts and calls so that participants would have to churn through them before gamma could be ramped. By the time it happened, theta would have made your positions not profitable. And Cohen would collect the premium as actors tried to hammer through those put and call walls. He basically does this to kill volalitity.

Plotkin was Cohen's right hand man.

So expect Plotkin will use the 2.75B to drive GME price below 60, then he will ressurect massive put/call walls around a strike price and wait out the ITM 60C options across the calendar. This will kill vol and dampen gamma to prevent a gamma squeeze that can trigger an infinite short squeeze.

**Retails counter move**

Retails only chance is to have a big whale on your side to blast threw those put/call walls that will kill vol; or it's a race against time to trigger the gamma squeeze before Plotkin drives the price below 60 and erects the massive put/call walls that make all the ITM 60C expire worthless and dampens anymore gamma ramping to force a short squeeze.

Retail must drive GME to 115 and soon

Hi there, 

I unfortuantley ""responsibly"" bought a bull debit spread on GME weeks before the squeeze here, for 2/5 $50/$51. I buy spreads to limit my risk and sometimes sell one end a few days to weeks before the other on spikes and drops. 

The p/l on this thing fluctuates like crazy, from +15k at one point to sometimes down $300. I've tried to exit for a small profit, for breakeven, but cannot be filled I think due to the prices fluctuations of the calls being so drastically different. I am thinking there is an opportunity here to make a lot off of this, by buying back my sold call and holding my other call for a few mins during a spike. I do daytrade every day, so I do believe I could have a decent probability of finding the right ""time"" but I could also potentially lose a ton due to the current pricing of GME options. 

&#x200B;

Any suggestions? I could just wait it out until 0DTE as well I suppose, and try it then without as much risk. Or just let it expire worthless, I didn't pay much for the spread. (.23c debit)

As the stock has rocketed in the past week I have maxed out my gain on the covered call. Normally I close the option and roll out but the spreads are so crazy right now I lose money unless I wait till expiry. 

I’d like to exercise early if possible and sell the shares at the 26.50 strike price and get this money working elsewhere. Is this possible?

On that front, if I exercise the option (I paid $3k), I’ll have to buy $10k worth of stock. Does that mean I’m out the $3k? Meaning I’m really “paying” $13k for the 100 shares, right?

The idea was that I'd capitalize on SPY being so intensely overbought in the past few weeks, and it's kinda been working. I've been periodically buying and selling puts every day and making a decent profit whenever SPY chops downward - then waiting for the rebound.

Today is obviously special, because the FOMC is meeting! As always, the hot topics are rates & tapering. It seems like everyone expects JPow to keep rates the same and not even mention tapering as something they'd consider yet... And it seems like the expected 4% GDP numbers could possibly have a 7.5% surprise.

I've been expecting a correction down towards ~360-370 for a while, but I'm not good at ""watching the Fed"" so I need help in anticipating what they might be up to, and what I should do. If JPow  acknowledges the market has been running too hot since Dec 16 and has a ""taper tantrum"", it should be the perfect catalyst for a big ol correction.

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

We might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.

1164,An explanation of what caused the trading halt and a defense for small trading apps,Discussion,222,l90an8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/,1612053898.0,"I can tell you right now with complete confidence that the only thing brokers who halted trading are guilty of was bad PR and nothing else. I was pissed when trading was halted, but now I’m just upset that I’m hearing people trash some trading apps which did absolutely nothing wrong and has done so much good in the past years. People are piling on, politicians from left right and center are wrapping their own agenda around it, and somehow we finally saw AOC and Ben Shapiro agree on something. People are thinking “they” control it from the top and they stopped it because they were scared of us. I can assure you none of that is true, it is conspiratorial thinking and it is all nonsense and unfounded.

Wanna know why? Read on, education ahead, and it’s good for you. 

When people in aggregate from exchange A buy 1 million dollar worth of a stock, if there’s not enough people selling that stock on exchange A, that stock needs to come from exchange B. That means that 1 million needs to be transferred from exchange A to B. Money transfer is very complicated (as you’ve probably seen with wire transfers) and take 2 business days to clear even for the big guys. Now, what would happen if before money clears, exchange A collapses and goes bust? Exchange B is fucked. It still promised and have to give its users  by law who sold those shares a 1 million dollars. Enter: Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation(DTCC)

DTCC is probably the biggest bank in the world and you’ve never heard of it. It acts as the man in the middle insurance company of sorts, it’s a self regulating private entity on wallstreet who’s existence is required by law. It exists to absorb all the risk of ripple effects of an exchange going bust and impacting other exchange. They basically want to take the risk of “what if that market we’re trading with doesn’t pay us?” completely off a brokers book. Also note, DTCC is not just for stock brokers, it’s for banks, institutional investors, hedge funds, mutual funds, all of them.

In my example, DTCC fronts exchange A the cash by guaranteeing the 1 mil for exchange B. All good so far right? Well there’s a small catch, DTCC needs to still protect itself from going insolvent, since it’s basically the backbone of the market, their chances of going insolvent cannot be even 0.000001%. 

So they have this formula that calculates an upfront collateral for a particular stock. This collateral needs to be given cash to DTCC on the time of the trade. It’s not speculative, it’s just math and it takes a lot f factors in like the broker’s finances(how much cash they got on reserve, etc.) and also factors in the stock being traded. Usually it comes down to 1-4% of the security. Say that 1 mil I mentioned earlier was all SPY stock, since it’s safe and all the upfront fee is 1%. So when the 1 mil buy happens, exchange A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of 1 million to fund B. Once the transaction clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back.

All that was happening with GameStop, but then the morning the guys got block, DTCC raised their collateral requirement for the meme stocks to 100%. Why? Well, because it’s volatile as fuck and they did not like the odds of keeping it lower. We all know that this is a bubble and given that so many retail investors are buying this stock on margin at $300+ which is for sure crashing to $20, most likely in an instant, there’s a solid chance some exchanges might go broke over it, so they can’t insure it.

Now what does this mean for exchange A? That means for every 1 million dollars of GameStop, exchange A needs to wire 1 mil to to exchange B AND immediately send another million cash to DTCC. Well now we got a sticky situation, at the current market cap, we’re talking hundreds of billions (that’s not a typo) that these firms need to cough up to DTCC for 2 business days! They simply don’t have the money so they halted it. That’s it. Then the next day they secured some loans, and managed to re offer the stocks at a limited quantity that their loans enabled them to.

One small clarification, I simplified my explanation by combining clearing firms and brokerages as one entity. In reality they’re usually separate(sometimes they’re not, for example the popular trading app I can’t name does their own clearing), the connection goes broker -> clearing firm -> DTC. Clearing firms are actually the companies that are trying to secure loans to support more, and it’s the clearing firms who don’t have enough money to pay DTC, so they just tell brokers “sorry, no GME, can’t clear it”


“Dude fuck DTCC, they’re evil, they’re the ones controlling from the top they should’ve left us be” 

Well last time they were too slow to raise the collateral was 2008. Lehman which was a clearing firm collapsed. Finally DTCC did what it was supposed to do! They paid out $500bn to clear all of Lehman’s outstanding transactions. But that’s not all, since DTCC was slow to raise their rates for certain securities at the time, they were legit at the risk of going insolvent if more banks and hedge funds collapsed. Enter Bailout, a loan to help everyone sort their shit out, clear out their transactions and not collapse. Had enough banks and hedge funds collapsed to push DTCC into insolvency, the entire United States paper market(stocks, bonds, etc.) would’ve collapsed(total market breakdown). Little known fact: DTCC technically owns almost all paper assets in the US, including yours and mine in a trust. Technically we are just beneficiaries of those stocks. Also, government has every right to take those away from you due to “national emergency”. Fun fact eh?

“DTCC is helping out their wallstreet buddies” 

No, they’re protecting the system, they raise collateral for all ultra volatile securities. They’d do it if hedge funds were profiting too.

“But why some markets did allow buying?” 

Well their clearing firms did, and some did their own clearing and they had enough cash to allow trading. And if you noticed, it was a ripple effect. TD was a clearing firm that was first to stop doing GME, then a bunch of brokers ran to other clearing firms, and now a clearing firm is servicing their existing brokers and all the refugees from TD, and naturally they got overloaded with GME. So they fell, and now two sets of refugees went and crash another, and eventually almost all brokers stopped offering GME and friends. 

“Why sell only then?”

Selling doesn’t require DTCC collateral, cuz a stock is going out not money. The stock is just a digital signature in DTCC’s database, it ain’t going anywhere, it’s not gonna go insolvent. Money on the other hand is more complicated and not just a digital signature on a database, it’s no guarantee you’ll get it from a buyer until it’s in your vaults, so you need a collateral until you get it

“Why was so and so broker selling GME without my permission”

Alright dude this one on you for getting a margin account, you agreed to it and all brokers do it. You know how those boomers alway tell you don’t get a margin account? This is why

“Why do we need DTCC anyways?”

They prevent cascading failures that doomers wish for on their birthdays. If a broker goes bust, suddenly that $2bn that broker was supposed to send to some other broker goes poof, and now that other broker is in the negative and goes bust, and so do all their debts to other companies

“Does DTCC raising the collateral requirement mean we were at risk of collapsing the financial system?”

Yea probably, but that’s why they raised the rates

“Why can’t markets just trade inside themselves and avoid sending money and DTCC”

They still need a transaction with DTCC because you all have your own bank accounts on a brokerage and DTCC being the owner of all stock needs to know which account which stock belongs to

“Wtf why does it take 2 business days to transfer money? Can’t they Zelle or some shit?”

It’s how things work at that large of a scale, they record transactions all day, end of the day they add it all up and move the money. One day to take the money from broker the clearing house, one day to move the money from clearing house to the receiving broker. It’s the same system as ACH transfers, which stands for automated clearing house

“Why is DTCC private and so centralized, break it apart!”

In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that’s why they took out new shorts on GME.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they’ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there’s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let’s move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I’ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I’ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I’m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple’s stock price rises and Gamestop’s (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn’t go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let’s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what’s known as an arbitrage trade. ***It's also a cluster of nuclear bombs that may go off for shorters***, but if it does, it'll make someone rich. I’ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It’s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scarce, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I’ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I’ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult means to buy back all the shares before the market discovers that these shares are valuable/high demand and Hedge funds will likely have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting data is a opaque dark art and it’s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn’t block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I’ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but an estimate short interest and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

**AMC**

[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)

Estimate Short Interest: 63M

Float: 102M

% of float shorted 62%

**Dillards (DDS)**

**Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)**

[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)

**MAC**

Estimate Short Interest: 71M

[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)

Estimate Short Interest: 48M

Float: 90M

% of float shorted: 53%

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze similar to what has happened with GME and AMC this week.

***It's why brokerages are likely preventing people from buying them or limiting the number of shares to buy.  They may have data that these shares have high short interest and are vulnerable to a short squeeze, so they may be actively limiting people from buying them to ensure a short squeeze doesn't happen.***  That is not a free market! They may be protecting hedge fund interest over your own ability to do what you want with your money.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren’t valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing a sudden drop in price, and signal people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares they need to acquire with this attack? Instead of buying all at once, they use short ladder attack with a short position to gain shares from people scared of a sudden price drop.

It’d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you’ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more shares to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

***If you believe in the infinite short squeeze thesis, you'll have to HOLD through this short ladder attack.  It'll be painful and you may panic.  But if you believe in the thesis, hold.  You'll only lose what you put, if the thesis is wrong, but if the thesis is correct, it may change your life.*** 

**Note:**   Strong short squeezes are usually seen when short interest is above 50%.  Anything lower and the hedge fund can't usually be squeezed unless they make a strategic misstep, which rarely happens.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you’re willing to lose. Diamond hands.

**TLDR;**

**Should hedge funds be force to liquidate their holdings because of a GME short squeeze, they will rush to cover their other high short position, because if they don't, they will lose control of the share price. But before they try to buy up the shares they owe, if millions of people have bought in before they are able to buy up all the shares, it may set up a short squeeze like with GME and AMC this week where those share prices went up 300%-600%.**

I started out with almost zero, and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year, I was able to completely change my life around. I used to think that if I worked hard, did my due diligence, traded smartly, I could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams. Something has shifted now. I no longer feel the same way, and I'm not sure if I ever will again.

I wonder if it's naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair. I'm not American so I wasn't aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008, but it seems that many people are equating what's happening now to back then, calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor.

They can crash multiple brokerages at the same time, disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously, manipulate price action in real-time by changing the supply/demand, unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted. We've always understood that the media was manipulated, but it was up to us if we wanted to listen. But our direct purchase of stocks, and outright price action manipulation, suddenly it feels very personal.

It just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that I've enjoyed and come to love so much, is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want, at any time they want in favor of their own interests. I came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement, and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities. I'm sad to think that I may never have this outlook again, in light of everything that's been coming out.  Just looking for words of encouragement right now. I love investing and I don't want that joy to be taken from me

I know this won’t be well received, but I’m concerned for a lot of people who’ve been buying GME stock thinking they’re somehow taking on Wall Street. To be fair, those who were early to the trade actually did hurt a couple hedge funds, but the people who followed changed the dynamic considerably.

I know you guys all want to stick it to the man. Unfortunately, you’ve created a situation where the man is going to screw you, hard.

What’s one thing hedge funds do that lead to this?

They find stocks that are overvalued, short them, and then wait.

What have you all done?

Created a horrifically overvalued stock.

Why do you think the short ratio is still more than 100% of the float?

Who do you think’s been selling you GME at $300 a share?

The guys who are going to buy it back from you in a month for $30. They have deeper pockets and more margin than Citron, and are perfectly content to wait you out, whether it’s next week or next year.

*To be clear, I have no skin in this game in either direction, though if I could stomach taking your life savings, I'd be one of the people selling you GME for $300.*

All this talk about retail investors screwing over hedge funds - you are literally giving those hedge funds all your money. People have leveraged their entire life savings to buy an overvalued stock. You are not beating Wall Street. This is their game. You are giving them your money.

Yes, it was funny, and Citron and Melvin took a hit on their initial trades. But now it’s open season on everyone who bought in. At the end of the day, you grossly overpaid for shares of a struggling retail company. That is what you now own.

How do you unwind this position? Is everyone going to hold until they die? What happens if GameStop, like so many other retail chains, goes bankrupt in a couple years, wiping out all the shareholders?

Even if you hold, you’ll be wiped out long before then. **At these price levels, GameStop’s leadership has a fiscal obligation to start diluting their stock as soon as legally possible.** It won’t matter if everyone holds if there’s suddenly 300% more shares available.

In the short term, the price could definitely go higher if retail investors have money to keep buying. So what happens if you manage to push it to $500, or $1000? Wall Street will be thrilled to keep selling you more shorted stock just like GameStop will be thrilled to keep printing it.

There is no way for everyone to unload their positions without losing massive amounts of money. There is no way for everyone to hold their positions without losing massive amounts of money.

You are playing Wall Street’s game and they are happy to take your money. This is going to end badly and is going to hurt a lot of people who can least afford it.

I don't have a lot of money hidden away. But until now, it's all been placed on a savings account with no interest whatsoever. Not understanding how to even buy stocks or knowing how the market works made me too afraid to do anything about it. Until now!

These last couple of days got me really interested in the stock market, so I decided to educate myself. I've been reading and learning a lot and, even though I still know very little, I finally took the first baby steps towards investing my savings for the first time yesterday (a very small portion of it).

I invested in two green funds and for fun I also bought one GME share. I understand I'm likely to lose a bit of money off GME, but I'm alright with that. It will have symbolic value as it was the stock that got me started. 

Anyway. I'm glad I took this step. Next thing to do is to set up a monthly saving. I'm a student, so it won't be much, but it will be better than nothing!

Just wanted to share my happiness with you. :)

The deal was put together on Monday, *i.e.* the same day the news came (fast writing!). Friday $GME closed at $65.

Following the math in [this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5jwnj/melvin_is_down_another_25_on_gme/), Melvin loses \~$1bn for each $12 increase in $GME price, which pans out to Melvin being under the water when GME hits \~$200.

Tuesday (26th), The price went from \~$88 at open to \~$148 at close. It opened the day after (the 27th) at \~$355, closing at \~$348.

Following the maths above, they should have been margin called at some point between Tuesday the 26th and Wednesday the 27th. Thursday the 28th, the price reached almost $500 a share (I believed it reached it in premarket). Again following the calculations above, that pans out to ***two Melvins and a half worth of GME that had to be paid back***. That's like ***$38 billions***. And that's just with the price as it was at some point on Thursday. With the ultra low liquidity and all the people holding like their lives depend on it, you *know* covering would have cost ***way*** more than that (this is just Melvin. The total amount of money needed to cover all shorted shares is *way* higher, but that would be distributed among who knows how many people, and we don't know their entry points, so that's impossible to estimate).

Question: ***who the fuck was going to pay for it***? Because Melvin sure wasn't. Would their broker be able to? To we know what kind of broker a hedge fun like Melvin uses, and the type of funds they have at their disposal?

Another question: I can imagine a margin call and full liquidation of a huge hedge fund like Melvin is not something that happens in the span of a few hours (correct me if I'm wrong). This makes me wonder: **what if the margin call** ***did*** **come for Melvin, but by the time it was processed, the debt  was so big that** ***no chance in hell*** **their broker/bank/whatever would have been able/willing to cover the rest?**

On Thursday, RH and many other brokers suddenly decided to stop allowing people to buy GME. Webull's CEO, in an interview on ZingerNation, pretty much said that they were forced to stop allowing buying of GME by their clearinghouse, because they risked otherwise not having the money to give people when they wanted to sell it in the future (it seems I can't link the youtube video of the interview, sorry). He even mentioned (as ""an example""), that if Melvin is not able to cover their debt, then it was their broker's job to cover it for them, and if the broker couldn't the clearing house had to pay. Now if all these institutions don't have enough money to pay for the debt, ***you get a total market meltdown***.

So, with all this in mind, I wonder, ***if people hold and the price doesn't budge, who is going to shill out the many billions to cover for Melvin's and co. recklessness?*** Like seriously, how do they get out of this situation? Who is going to suck up such an amount of losses at this stage? Do these guys have insurance for this sort of situation? And what kind of money would these company have?",66,stocks

I've always operated under the assumption that big investors run the network and are the ones with access to get invited on their shows to promote their plays. It comes with the territory knowing that every guest is on there to push an agenda, but generally, my general feeling was they aren't out to screw you over and wanted to be helpful to their viewers.

When I was learning about investing, I did value a lot of the advice they give on diversification, risk, and rising trends. I've even got some massive returns from a few ideas I got solely from watching (MSTR +132% AMZN +73%, TGT +81%, NVDA +63%).

Which takes us to this week where CNBC has been a constant whipping boy on r/wallstreetbets.

1177,Some thoughts on the NOK longer term play,Discussion,86,l8u4la,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8u4la/some_thoughts_on_the_nok_longer_term_play/,1612036547.0,"  I’m bullish on NOK, have 31 x $10c 1/22 contracts at an average $0.77. Pretty new to option trading so don’t want to go totally in yet, but depending on what happens with earnings I might pick up some more.

I think a lot of the commentary around NOK seems to be expecting it to moon this week or next week, and while a good earnings release might see that, I want to explain at a high level why I’m bullish longer term, and not looking at it as a get rich quick, or a short squeeze or anything like that. As I say, pretty new, so would welcome people poking holes.

Firstly – NOK is not a mobile company, it is 5G company. 5G has enormous potential in the world – it will be a critical part of truly autonomous vehicles, drone technology etc. It’s not just so you can stream your favorite OnlyFans in 4k while on a car trip with your parents. It’s also worth noting that 5G hasn’t even scratched the surface yet. Mobile companies saying they have “5G networks” are full of it, they are retrofitted 4G networks that can barely be called 5G light. 5G requires all new infrastructure, and the expected expenditure across the world is measured in the trillions, not billions.

There are 3 main players in the 5G market – Ericcson, Nokia, and Huawei. Other players (like Samsung) are in the mix, but at a lower level (although do represent a competitive threat to Nokia). Huawei has largely been shut out of 5G in the western world, which means Nokia & Ericsson are in a prime position to capitalize. Ericsson actually has much higher exposure to China than Nokia, which doesn’t seem ot be priced into their share price, but one would expect China will take revenge eventually

Between Ericcson & Nokia – a lot of key metrics (revenue, margins etc.) are pretty comparable. Both have revenue around \~US$25b, broadly similar margins etc. Despite that, Nokia’s market cap is around \~$25b, vs Ericsson is DOUBLE that at around \~$42b. In other words – Ericsson is trading at a significant premium to Nokia at the moment, despite having reasonably similar underlying businesses. The general belief is that Ericsson has been the better run business, has a bigger share of the 5G market etc., but that also doesn’t give Nokia credit for the work they have done recently, including putting a complete change to their operating model going into place 1/1/21, a new management team etc. While there’s a risk none of that pans out, it also represents a good opportunity if they can start to run the business a bit better.

Ericsson released earnings this last week and crushed it – earnings rose 70% compared to last year, with 2020 operating income up 163% compared to 2019. They are still massively exposed in China, which still doesn’t seem priced in (share price rose \~10% after earnings release). Nokia releases earnings this week – if they meet or beat (consensus is a miss I believe), and particularly if they reinstate a dividend, Nokia could be seen a lot more favorably in the market. Alternatively, if it’s a miss I still think it’ll be a good buying opportunity for an expected earnings crush a quarter or two from now.",69,stocks

*  I don't work in finance.
- I'm not invested or shorting.
- My wife is hours away from labor so I'm trying to write this up before it's time for the hospital.
- I also posted this in WSB but feel this is a different audience. 

**If not for 2 (major) events, last week I think that AMC stock could have gone to $50+.**

**Let's recap the basics (per [Yahoo & quarterly statements](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC)):**


* Outstanding shares (287.28M)
* Float: 101.95M (Q3 2020)
* 2020 Income (Q1-Q3): $1 Billion
* 2020 Net Income (Q1-Q3): -$3.6 Billion

**Balance Sheet (As of Q3 2020)**

* Assets: $10.8B (-2.8B vs Q4 2019)
* Liabilities: $13.2B (+0.8B vs Q4)
* Cash: $428 Million

**The major events were:**

* 1A) $304 Million dollar stock offering on Monday and Tuesday averaging $4.81/share (63M shares) [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-completes-market-equity-program-170800262.html)
* 1B) $600 Million of debt conversion to shares on Wednesday (44M shares) [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-sells-shares-113-million-reddit-2021-1), which were sold off by the investor Wednesday morning.
* 2) Robinhood preventing purchases - No source need


**1A - $300M stock offering**

This was a share offering that added 100 Million shares to the market. It allowed AMC to sell shares directly to the public to raise cash to run the business. They got $300+ million in cash but were selling at under $5/share. This took the **float from 100M to 160M shares**. *Up 60%*. Because of the prior run up and buzz already starting, the was eaten up by the public without any significant change to the stock price. It probably should've risen a few bucks given they **DILUTED 60%**, but for time's sake I'll ignore since overall market cap was still low. 

 **1B - $600 Million debt conversion to shares**

Overnight the stock was up 3-4x going into Wednesday dramatically increasing share price and market cap. They had a prior debt agreement which allowed for conversions from bonds into stock. Given the overnight increase in price, this was executed. **Silver Lake obtained $600 million dollars worth of shares at the agreed price of ~$13**. This was sold on the market during the morning. This translates to another **44M shares**. If we take a look Wednesday's chart. **We see they opened at $20, but immediately dropped to the day low of $11.01**. This was likely due to newly available shares (and some sell off). The public was buying shares and stock rose to $17.50 before downward pressure (some sell off, also assume a second chunk of new shares. If we remove even half of these down trends (assuming the other half is profit taking), the stock should've closed at about **$26.**

See these charts for a simple [Before](https://imgur.com/Fryz3CM) and [After](https://imgur.com/1HYvQQQ). 

**2 - Limited purchases**

We all know this part. In premarket the stock was up to $23 (Up another 15%), but opened at $12. I'm losing steam here, but imagine another 15% from yesterday's predicted 26 (**$30 open**). And clearly continued gain which started again Friday. but even still was impacted by return of restrictions by trading apps (There was another post with charts to back this up already, I wont repeat it).





**Overall:**

* AMC added 100M shares significantly limiting this run up, and there are already talks of more [on the way](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/amc-entertainment-explores-raising-new-capital-as-its-stock-surges-sources-say.html). 
* AMC remains with significant debt and limited income, making the previous bullet point even more possible
* Short float may be ~20% after dilution, depending if shorts covered or added to positions.
* This stock really could have MOONED faster than even GME, if not for the offerings and trading apps interfering.

**TLDR:**

AMC diluted shareholders by $1B and 100M shares in two days. Without these extra 100M shares doubling the shares available, the stock would've risen DRAMATICALLY higher. This was compounded by trading apps preventing purchases. Additionally, shorts got diluted and now might estimated at just~20% of float. **BE CAREFUL.**

So I’m thinking about the lock-up expiration and wondering what the best play would be here. According to Nasdaq.com they estimate Earnings Release on Feb 11th but we should assume +- of two weeks for safety

Earnings Range:

Feb 9th- Feb 25th

Now this is important because lock-up ends THREE days after this day. I think the best bet is that the stock actually drops significantly. Now you could say “but employees could actually hold their restricted shares” which would boost the price especially after a good earnings.. BUT if they truly believe in the product it would be in their best interest to sell all their restricted to dump the price, then purchase more shares at the lower price.

Couple this with an increase in bearish news from the shit media (CNBC, Citron lol) and I think the price continues to drop in the short term.

I think Feb 26th or March 5th Puts is the play. If the price goes down I would exit and use the proceeds to purchase more PLTR. If the price goes parabolic because of good earnings and employees not selling, share gains should hedge the Put Option loss.

Thoughts? Not a financial advisor, not making any plans to manipulate, just a thought exercise and sharing to see if there are any logical errors in this line of thought.

When the Harry Potter books first came out, there was a lot of demand. It might have been profitable to borrow a copy from the public library and sell it on eBay. Sure, you now owed a copy to the library and they were charging you late fees; but you just made $50 and eventually you'd pick up a used copy for $5 once the hype died down and you'd finish miles ahead. Unless something crazy happened like every copy of the Harry Potter books being sold out for months and all the used ones going for more than you sold your library book for. Then you'd be watching the cost of the books keep rising and you'd be accumulating late fees to boot. And since people were still wanting to read the book, the library would have to buy a replacement for the book you hadn't returned while they waited for you to return it. Now imagine that happening on a massive scale, creating tons of demand with limited supply. That is what is happening with GME. The short sellers haven't returned their library books yet and they are paying more and more late fees while they wait for the price of replacement books to come back down. Except the price won't come down and eventually they'll have to start buying books at market price or the cost of the late fees and the opportunity cost of having their resources set aside for replacing library books will make their losses even worse. This will cause more demand, increasing the price of the books, creating even more urgency for degenerate borrows to cut their losses and move on.

Even better, the borrowers are currently committed to returning more books that are actually available to be bought at any price and the publisher is not printing any more.

That is why holding the stock makes sense.",206,stocks

What I don't understand is, I thought the point of option are you don't have to exercise if it is unfavorable, so couldn't the market makers just not exercise.



Secondly, I hear people saying shorts technically have no expiry date, they just have to pay a premium. What is to say they just wait the fomo out?

This may have started as retail vs hedge fund, but by now, it's definitely retail and hedge funds vs hedge funds. There is incredibly smart money, willing to trade emotionlessly with perfect information and bots  in a battle of timing on both sides of this trade. The fact that it closed at $200/share on Thursday means hedge funds with near infinite money were thinking it's probably not worth participating in the short squeeze for more than $200/share. The pros didn't think it was guaranteed money at $200/share and the pros never turn down guaranteed free money. That should bring great caution to anyone still looking to get in. 

What will likely happen is it will end up selling for large amounts per share for a very short amount of time, and then very rapidly crater in price. Hedge funds on the long side of the trade will be able to execute their sells near perfectly, and retail traders will likely be bag holders after it craters who don't have access to bots for perfectly executed sells. Another very real possibility is there is no pop, remember, the hedge funds didn't buy up all the shares at $200 and just wait for it to climb to $250. They didn't think it was guaranteed to go to $250, which would be well under a pop level.

This is just my opinion, but I'd exercise great caution before touching this with a 10 foot pole at these prices, and definitely not with any meaningful amount of money. I'd also strongly consider cashing some out if you are already in.

I could still get a 100% return even with a high stock price, how?** There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the entire world that would ever keep GameStop's price at or above the levels they are today in the next 10 years. There was, however, 150% short interest on the float.

Let's simplify this: You have 1 🍎 that you cut into 10 slices. 10 Slices are the outstanding shares. You give 2 🍎 slices to your friends and these become restricted. You go to a Farmer's Market and take your 8 🍎 slices with you to sell. This is the float.

Someone comes along and thinks 🍎 prices will tank, so they want to short the market. They think it will tank so badly they want to short more than the total number of 🍎 that are available on the market. Hedge Funds can do this (for now).

**That seems crazy, what does it mean though?** In order to short 🍎 a hedge has to ""borrow"" them. They pay interest on this. The longer time it takes for the price of an 🍎 to go down, the more interest they have to pay. Also, if the price of 🍎 skyrocket, the person who is lending out 🍎 might claw them back, forcing the shorter to pay a high price to close out their short.

**So when do I make $10,000 / share and retire?** That's never going to happen...sorry. People are claiming if you set your limit sell order to an absurd number eventually a short has to buy it to cover. Most brokerages will limit the level above the strike you can set a limit. However, there is still a large % of the stock being shorted. It's possible that is several million of those shorts need to close, they would have to buy the stock at a very high price ($312.01 or possibly higher) and this would likely cause the stock to start climbing higher and higher as the shareholders don't want to sell their stock for a low price.

**Why did you say Gamestop was a terrible company**:

Gamestop is a terrible company. You literally have to be the biggest idiot in the world to think that Gamestop is worth more money than (throwing out a popular company name that is now smaller in market cap, BEST BUY). I've seen so many bandwagon investors with $5 in their trading account buying a fractional share because ""the GameStop at my mall is always busy""

And?

Other genius ideas I've seen on Reddit:

1. ""GameStop should get into custom pc builds, that would be huge!""
2. ""GameStop should do 'paint-n-sip' type parties for gamers, that's a rock-solid business""

Anyone with these ideas has no idea how a business functions, what a TAM (total addressable market) is, or has ever looked at the GameStop balance sheet from any of the past earnings reports. **GameStop is a dying business, it is Blockbuster, it is Netflix had Netflix kept trying to mail people DvD's instead of streaming.**

Remember what happened to bc in 2017....that's going to happen with $GME at some point, it's not for certain when or how high the price could go before it comes down, but it will come down. If shorts closing out positions make the price go up, in order to cash out shareholders need to sell those shares. At a certain point, the shorts will be done and shareholders will be selling to others who think the price can keep going. Those people who don't understand anything about the market and just think they're going to make thousands or millions overnight are going to be the ones who end up losing virtually all of their investment if they got to the party late.

**Why can't GameStop be a good company, how do you know anything?**

1. I run a venture capital firm, I invest in companies and am looking at the future outlook of the business, what companies should be valued, will it be worth it to put $$ in them and what is the likelihood I will make money on that investment.
2. GameStop could turn things around, by doing 1 thing. Going digital. Think about Steam, Stadia, Epic Games....even Apple Arcade on Apple TV. Tech is catching up, everything will be digital. Do you really think that if someone opened up a video game rental store with discs, or a DVD rental store with discs it would become an insanely popular valuable company? No. But nonstop new companies start streaming content...and those do become popular.
3. Also, take into consideration 5G is here, although not everywhere. 5G is going to enable a lot of people to see significantly higher download speeds than they have even if they have 1gbps with Fios or any other traditional provider, stuff like this is only going to get faster and faster to the point that you literally will be able to stream a game in 4k UHD without even downloading it beforehand.

&#x200B;

Remember, just because it's *possible* that the stock could go up due to the short interest, there is no guarantee it does. Don't risk more money than you're willing to lose and don't buy into a lot of the hype you read on Reddit. 99.99% of the people on here now throwing out financial advice don't know anything.

Think about it. If you were so good at investing that you made a fortune...why would you tell other people how to do it? This would limit your ability to continue doing exactly what you do without being arbitraged by others.

Before, the shady activity of the brokerages was hidden from the general public. They were able to manipulate the markets all they wanted and get away with it because the ""commoners"" didn't care or understand. 

Now, with millions of retain investors that flooded the market, a shift in ""market influence"" in favor of smaller, amateur traders. And the gargantuan, amorphous investment firms didn't like that at all. 

It has become a battle of market influence, and the hedge funds and brokerages with massive amounts of capital are doing WHATEVER IT TAKES (illegal or not) to make sure that they retain that authority that they previously held for so many years. (flooding certain stocks with short positions, disabling certain stocks)

But with investment firms taking blatant illegal action to accomplish their goals, their shady activity has been revealed for the world to see and it seem as of now, that the general public, as well as some democrat lawmakers have taken an interest to them. (It also shows how corrupt the SEC is with them taking their sweet time to decide which side they want to be on)

Hopefully through this incident, the integrity of the US markets can be improved with dishonest brokerages being dissolved. (I think it is wishful thinking that market makers such as Citadel could be dissolved, considering the HUGE number of brokerages with reliance to the company)",99,stocks

\----

First of all, I am by no means a financial expert or claim to be one. I am successful at doing stuff with my money (avg return / year of well over 15%) and think I can handle myself.

I also am 45 years old and have seen a few things here and there.

I was also something you could call ""an early adopter"" when it comes to the internet, social media, etc etc.

My predictions (or rather, opinions) are more or less based upon the latter two.

&#x200B;

So here we go.

**The current situation**

From what I gathered, there´s different types of people involved. And I am solely talking about the retailers here. The side of the whole thing that THINK, they got all the leverage.

&#x200B;

1. **the Believers**

those make up the people that pake part because they believe they finally have some say , some kind of leverage, some kind of power to force real change. whether it is changes to market rules, legal oversight, changes of law... you name it. those people have real conviction and are willing to see it through.

&#x200B;

**2. the investors**

there might be overlap to group 1., yet these people have actual believe , not only in the message being sent, but the company as well. you can argue all you want, but the fact is that GME brought in new, extremely committed and experienced management and was / is in the phase of a corporate change. it might take them years and it might fail, but there is a chance they might pull it off. group 2 believes in this, hence the investment into it.

&#x200B;

**3. the traders**

they see this purely as a chance of having one of the best chance of high yield return of their lifetime (which is not wrong at all). they might also believe that they help the world become a better place to justify their behavior, which is also ok. yet they are mainly in for the gains. they are rather rational about the situation and simply wait for thee right moment. the only thing that sets them apart from 4, is their actual rational response to the situation

&#x200B;

**4. the hyper.**

those people jump on the bandwagon simply because it is happening. the same people will spread their money around, buying AMC, doge or even silver right now. they lack the understanding or they lack interest and patience to really try to understand the situation at all.

they want clout, ganis, or- the best - they want both. some are even stupid enough to sell all they have, luquidate whatever available and pour everything into one stock, if the hype is big enough.

&#x200B;

**Prediction**

**group 4:**

trends change, sentiments and rationales change. they were never so easy to manipulate as well.

most people will get bored , or simply jump on the next bandwagon. this means, 4 will skip the train as soon as the holding battle simply takes too long for their attention span. if you do not have the cashflow to actively be involved in regards to buying more when the price warrants it, you got nothing to do but wait and be patient. which is a concept very hard to grasp when you are trying to keep up with ery single hypetrain out there.

and since they all over sudden realize that they got all their assets into one thing thats not doing anything, they will simply pull out sooner rather than later.

at one point in the normal market fluctuation they will set their limits lower than anticipated and just jump ship.

**group 3**

will eventually do the same, just a little later, simply because they understand the situation better and have much smarter goals. they are in it for the returns. right now they might not be 100% sure what target that is, but they will form a decision really soon. remember, they were never in it for the long run...

**group 2**  
remember, they are in it for the long run anyways. but as said before, patient and REAL investors that see long term potential are kinda rare these days. and not enough are in it right now.

**group 1:**

they are saying they will ride it out until the end. which is great.

&#x200B;

so what does all this mean:

people underestimate how markets work, what strings will and can be pulled. they overestimate patience and conviction.

also, people TOTALLY and utterly fail to understand the core principle of greed, which drives most of the groups mentioned here.

&#x200B;

once the price of each individual involved is reached, the cookie WILL start to crumble.

for some its 500, for most it might be 750, 1000 dollars.

who knows. but this is no situation that will be going on for weeks. this will fade out. simply because most people lose interest or see their chances of high returns dwindling. or they need their money for other investments. or they suddenly realize that putting all this money into something that doesnt pan out wasn´t so smart afterall.

&#x200B;

**OVERALL**

I sincerely hope changes will come- and they probably will.

The current situation clearly exposed how markets are worked and how they operate on a level of transparency, that only happened in 2008.

so how did things change after 2008 ? now think about the ramifications of 2008 compared to this. now try to think - rationaly - how realistic it is that actual , FUNDAMENTAL changes are being established and put into action ?

do you really think they will make short sales illegal ? do you really think they will make naked sales illegal ? do you think they will make fundamental changes to what the SEC actually controls and how they do it ? seriously ?

the only thing that will come from this, MIGHT be:

\- better(harsher) regulations for retail trading platforms

&#x200B;

\- harsher regulations regarding market manupilations through means of social media

&#x200B;

\- a wealth tax for the super rich.

&#x200B;

why this ? because it is easy to sell to the public, build hype and support upon it. will it change anything ? of course not. Oh wait, yes it will. it will make it harder for retail traders. it will make it harder for us.

&#x200B;

more regulations for trade providers means more costs at providing services means no free trading apps anymore. hard to make a buck for trading apps when you cannot sell trade information of your customers to market makers anymore.

&#x200B;

we already are being censored more and more. words are flagged, opinions are flagged, and sooner or later, forums, and whole platforms will be flagged. and then closed and called illegal. its already happening in regards to other platforms. Not that I really care or support anyone using sovial media for dusgusting and absurd poilitical reasons and opinions, but censoring and de-legalizing it is still censorship. thats not something that can be good any democracy.

&#x200B;

and a wealth tax for the super rich? that´s like revers trickle down ecomomics. instead of thinking when they have all their money it will trickle down, we just make sure they pay for it once they have it.

it disregards the fact that simply ba having money, they also have the means to pay lawyers a few millions to find ways they do not have to pay even more millions to pay their taxes. its what´s already happening. this will not help the small , average Joe",139,stocks

2. I read somewhere that the squeeze will raise the price of GME, but what happens when the hedge funds that shorted are out of money AFTER they've liquidated all of their assets, too?
3. Lastly, What happens when those of us that hold for a long time, let's just say it gets to $10000, and everyone starts selling their shares off? The price of the stock would start to decrease, correct?

But isn't it a possibility that the hedge funds hold forever? The hedge funds are currently paying a fee of about \~16 million dollars a day if my math and information is correct (30% fee on 330 = 99 dollars, 99 x 60 million shares / 365 = \~16 million dollars) This sum is nothing for these hedge funds since the other alternative they've got is to go bankrupt if they decide to start buying shares back. This is a fight for their survival which means they will hold until they die, why would they surrender now and bankrupt themselves? And since the float is so low they can continue doing their short attacks to push the price down and pay even smaller fees. So what's says that the short squeeze will come even this year? They will continue to bleed money until they are eventually forces to cover but that could take months, and eventually people will tire out and start selling which will crash the price and they'll win?

I'm far from an expert in this area but i'm just trying to understand how we can force them to start covering their positions with fees this low and with the brokers and market makers on their side it's easier for them to shut us down?

**TLDR:** I got a bunch of money to invest. I invested near the all-time highs, and now I'm scared that we're gonna see a big correction because of what's happening with GME, and I don't know what to do.

Hi everyone! I'd firstly like to say thank you to anyone who's taking their time to read this. I really appreciate it! So without further ado, here's my situation:

Around 2 weeks ago, I got a large sum of money (at least to me) of $20,000. I was told that I could do anything I wanted with it and of course, I decided that it would be a good idea to invest! I've never invested with this much money before, so I was, and still am, very nervous about losing it. I decided to invest in what I consider to be ""safe"" stocks (obviously, there's risk in everything, but I think the stocks I chose are not too awfully risky). Unfortunately, I had no idea what would happen with GME, and I've missed out on that rocket ship since I didn't have any cash left when it took off, and I had no clue what was happening with it at the time. So far, these are the stocks I've invested in:

**APPL: 24 shares @ $132**

**AAL: 100 shares @ $14**

**DAL: 31 shares @ $38**

**Total (including leftover cash): $19,891 (down $1000 from $20,891 last week.** ***ouch***)

My investment ""strategy"" that I had in my head when I was choosing all of these stocks a few weeks ago was that I'm just starting college, and I'm fortunate to have all of my expenses covered. Because of this, I don't really have anything to spend money on right now, so instead of just having $20K sitting in my bank account, I thought it'd be a good idea to invest it. I plan to hold onto these stocks for the next 5 years while I'm in school so that by the time I graduate, I'll have a nice sum of money to start my life with.

**Here is my concern:** I've seen some talk on this sub recently that we might see a correction to the markets as a result of this whole GME thing. This worries me because when I bought all of these stocks (2-ish weeks ago), I got most of them (except for AAL, and DAL) at/or really close to their all-time highs. I'm sure that in 5 years, I'll have made a decent amount of money from this investment, but I'm wondering if it might not be worth it to cover my $110 loss and sell some of my stocks so that I can buy back in if the market ends up dropping. If I were to do this, I'd sell everything except AAL, DAL, MSFT, and APPL.

This is where I'd like your guy's advice. I have no idea what to do right now, and I'm worried that my emotions are making decisions, which never ends well. I keep going back and forth in my head on whether or not I should hold onto what I have and wait or if I should sell and re-invest in the dip. If I do sell, I'll have roughly $10,200 to work with. My thought is to split that into two $5k portions. I'll split one evenly back into AAL, DAL, APPL, and MSFT and the other $5k that I'd put into much higher risk stuff with the chance of making some big returns on them at the risk of losing it all.

I'd love to hear what you guys have to say about this, and if you guys have any suggestions on stocks you think will do very well, I'd love to hear about it! *(obviously, anything I invest in is my own responsibility, and I'll do my own research on any suggestions given)* Thanks!!",19,stocks
1218,Could this GameStop (GME) bubble be what pops the stock market bubble that Jeremy Grantham says that we are currently in?,Discussion,12,l8vj7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8vj7f/could_this_gamestop_gme_bubble_be_what_pops_the/,1612040296.0,"\[I am all over the place and my mind is racing.  My apologies.\]

If/when this Gamestop (GME) bubble pops.  It could mean that there could be a scramble to sell stocks to cover the shorts.  The government may be able to stop the GME bubble popping somehow.  I think that the government should let the GME bubble pop (likely in favor of those going long) by not interfering, and not on the side of the initiating hedge funds going short.

Apparently Gamestop can just issue more shares to mitigate the bubble popping.  I expect that they will, this is a no brainer.  Gamestop almost certainly does not have enough stock to stop it from popping (or do they?).

The INITIATING hedge funds, the short side, might win by outlasting the opposition.  But is is apparently ALOT more expensive and risky for the initiating short side hedge funds.  There are hedge funds on the other side.  Billionaires on each side.  The long side of the GME bubble seems more likely to pop to me.

If the GME bubble pops in favor the the long investors, then all the stocks will likely drop.  I wonder how big the drop would be.

Could this GameStop (GME) bubble be what pops the stock market bubble that Jeremy Grantham says that we are currently in?

I am not a professional.  I think 100% cash might be the correct move until this GameStop thing blows over.  Then we see.  If no market as a whole bubble pop, then 70% cash/bonds 30% stock (industrials) until a bubble pop (maybe never, but I take Jeremy Grantham seriously).  After a bubble pop 100% stock (if in the near future, then heavy in industrials).  The millennials should be able to take it from there.  The millennials should be able to make a roaring economy all by themselves in legion.  We would also see stock market reform, a lot more if the market as a whole pops.",49,stocks

""***Confusion over “short vs. float”.***   Prior to the announcement from Porsche, and as the financial crisis  was  becoming more apparent, short interest in VW had been steadily  rising.   But even by October 2008, the short interest seemed not  excessive, at  just 12.8% of outstanding shares. But what the market  failed to  appreciate was that the true availability of tradeable shares  to cover  those short positions was actually far lower than what many  understood.""

Read that last part again, about what made the short squeeze so dangerous.

""**What  the market failed to appreciate was that the true availability of  tradeable shares to cover those short positions was actually far lower  than what many understood.**""

In the case of GME, the current usage % of float is **100%. (From Ortex data, it has been at 100% for the last several months).**  All shares of free float are either being held, or loaned. As large  institutional players buckle down for a massive staring contest, **the shorts hold the losing position.**  Basically, let's face it - the retail investor can provide  pushes to the market, but we do not have collectively have the capital  for sustained attacks from coordinated interests. There are institutions  on the retail investor's side - they're also interested in buying and holding the  stock. They like the stock. It costs nothing to hold.

The  short interest at the time was about 12% of float ... compared to our  current estimates from as low as  \~75% - 120% of float, depending on  your sources. (It's 75% according to Ortex, and 113% according to S3  Partners)

The current availability of tradeable shares, though is... 0%. I think it was as low as like, 1% in the VW squeeze.

I thought this seemed worth discussing. What are the implications of 100% Utilization? Does it matter? Or are the two scenarios so disparate that it's not something that's merited discussion? Just curious. Here to learn.",25,stocks

1223,My case for PCG (Pacific Gas and Electric). Big catalyst from Palatir.,Ticker Discussion,5,l8y6kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8y6kw/my_case_for_pcg_pacific_gas_and_electric_big/,1612047712.0,"*I am not a financial advisor. I am simply sharing my insight on PCG, having been a customer for years and an investor that has lost a lot on PCG in 2018. This is not financial advice, invest at your own discretion*


**INTRO**  
Don't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 100%-500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify!

**TL:DR** \- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -> $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40. SIGNED CONTRACT WITH PALANTIR! Going to be the safest utility in the state EOY. Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!

**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&E)**

PCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   


Since the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERYWHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   


This last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too slow.   


**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  


I'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining their operation.  


Here is the balance sheet (scroll down for the ""liabilities"" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  


All things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   


**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**

Two weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   


This is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, here is the video from Demo Day 3 days ago (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo): [Demo Day Video](https://youtu.be/jgj6FYghPh8)  


Remember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   


Palantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the ""fear"" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   


**Potential**  


PCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   


This is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the ""we're you're only choice, deal with it"" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   


**Final note, sorry about the profanity**  


After the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.

I only recently (early December) decided to start investing in stocks for reason outside of making money. I initially began because I became aware that saving money isn’t my strong suit, so I began looking for ways to “save”. I’ve slowly put in about 25% of paychecks (biweekly, guaranteed/government jobs) and have come to see my stocks slowly rise. 

Having seen myself gain 200-300 randomly on stocks rising, when I was only expected to save, has lit a fire in me. The more I’ve been on this sub shows me how l can actually benefit immensely from stocks. My current dilemna is whether to go in it for the long run, ie. keep investing into SPCE, or whether to go for the really volatile stocks and go for the big plays. The money isn’t necessarily life or death, but being comfortable financially would certainly help.

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**

I’m no DFV, this isn’t my retirement, but if I can walk away with some more money to put towards my kids college funds, that’s a win for me. Just don’t know how far this ride is expected to go...

Obviously no advice given is “financial advice” but I’ll take what you guys can offer

Edit: stupid autocorrect

Edit 2: thank you all for your advice. I like the “just set a personal number and walk” idea. Again this was never my retirement plan, but hopefully just a way to add a little more to the nest egg.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
> “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
> “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
> But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

They are having maintenance done on their site right now so no updated data on GME options until Sunday. Convient. The SEC is supposed to have oversight of them. Lies were told across all major news networks. Interviews were given and headlines tried to push a narrative. They tried to paint r/wallstreetbets in a bad light. They took financial freedom away from us on Thursday January 28th 2021. They limited access to buy stocks and drove the options price down to almost exactly max pain. On low volume while they locked us out of a ""free""market. This seems like it was even more messed up for the options market. Those same news stations all point to Robinhood a company that was soon to IPO at close to 20 Billion dollars. A company that was on a future course to make more in payment orders for stock and options than any other broker. Another thing I have never seen is that bid/ask. The market makers were allowed to set it way wider than normal. That is not the issue. Someone needs to investigate why the bid was lowered so much lower almost all day than the ask.

Then they short the market even more to make buck during the dip,  move there money they made to an off sore account or some other way to hide their money. Say they can't pay, and goes bankrupt. Then the bank has to pay. THEY go bankrupt. Its left on the government.

What does the government do? I don't see the government buying stock. Won't the government just cut the middle man out (the people who bought GME: AKA you and me.) And simply write company A  a check for what the stock is worth either when it was borrowed or at stock price?

So I'll cut to the chase. ORTEX data is currently showing 30 M shares loaned and 50 M float... So about 60%. I've been told this doesn't include systhetic shorts which make up of the other 40% (so 20 M synthetic shorts). This is apparently confirmed by S3 data yet I am only ever presented tweets as proof.

My question is, if this is true, then why does Ortex data on the 15th shows 80 M shares short? This seems to be accurate and include synthetic shorts? So did 50 M positions close since the 15th? Or does the updated data not yet include synthetic shorts?

Google’s ROE is about 12%, so 6-7% typical interest on the cap isnt great, but it’s not nothing either.

The stock is Arconic Corporation ARNC. They manufacture aluminum products for the auto, aerospace, building and Industrial sectors. Their primary markets are auto and aerospace. The were spun out of Alcoa in 2016 and separated the Howmet business in 2020. 

Market cap: $2.8B
PE: 16.35

They turned a profit last quarter even with the pandemic reducing revenues. I’ll highlight a few reasons I believe the stock is poised for growth.

Auto sector: the Obama era EPA legislated fuel efficiency improvements which caused automakers to try to shed weight on autos. Replacing steel with Aluminum components was a common practice. Ford embraced the strategy and in 2015 started making the F series trucks out of Aluminum. Arconic is one of two suppliers for the aluminum body components. Arconic worked with Audi to produce the first all aluminum um car. Other automakers use Aluminum for hoods, trunks, etc to cut weight. 

EV ANGLE - EV’s all have the issue of range and will compete heavily on range. In order in increase range, weight must be managed especially with an 1200lb battery pack (Tesla S). EV’s use 20-25% more aluminum than ICE vehicles.  From 2020-2026 aluminum use across all vehicles is forecast to increase to 514lbs/vehicle and to 570lbs/vehicle by 2030 an increase of 24%. Arconic is very well positioned to benefit from this growth with their specialty sheet and extrusion product lines. Their A951 adhesive bonding technology solves issues with joining aluminum to itself that welding causes due to deformation of the Aluminum. They are the undisputed leaders in Aluminum auto body panel manufacturing.  A position which should ensure growth as EV adoption increases and traditional ICE vehicles get put on a diet. 

http://1pp2jy1h0dtm6dg8i11qjfb1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DuckerFrontier-Aluminum-Association-2020-Content-Study-Summary-Report-FINAL.pdf

https://www.arconic.com/a951-bonding-breakthrough/

The Biden administration will likely keep the pressure up on fuel efficiency requirements and EV adoption. Additionally, Arconic’s US manufacturing means that car companies have a supplier that is immune from tariff shocks. 

Aerospace: the next major boost for Arconic in the next couple of years will come from the aerospace segment. Arconic took a massive hit from Boeing’s 737 Max debacle. Arconic is said to have $1.6M of product into a single Max platform plane. This has been a serious drag on the stock. Boeing has 450 Max 737s I’m inventory and now only expects to deliver half of those in 2021 and the remainder in 2022 due to the pandemics effect on airlines. Given the lead time new order flow from Boeing would likely start occurring in 2022 and ramping as the year progresses. After cancellations and accounting for orders unlikely to be filled, Boeing still had a backlog of 3,290 planes.  The resumption of deliveries will mean a significant boost to Arconic’s revenue. 

Expiration of non-compete: Arconic had a non-compete agreement with former parent Alcoa in the aluminum can business that expired in Q4. 

While not a GME double your money in a day play, I expect Arconic to significantly outperform the market over the next 24 months. 

TL:DR At a PE of 16.35 this is a very reasonably priced company in today’s market.  EV adoption will turbo charge the already strong growth of Aluminum in the auto sector where Arconic is the undisputed leader. The return of the Boeing Max 737 to service will drive significant revenue growth of $1.6M/plane.",2,stocks

I've been frustrated to see that stock analyses on non-meme stocks aren't really happening right now so I thought I would talk about one of my favorite stocks at the moment. 

Sun Communities, Inc. ($SUI) - owns and operates 432 manufactured housing and RV communities in 32 states and Ontario.  In November they acquired Safe Harbor Marina (formerly owned by the Koch Brothers) adding  99 marinas across 22 states.

Sun is a REIT collecting rent from over 146,000 mobile home sites each month.  And they collect it all; even during the worst months of the pandemic, Sun was collecting 97% or more of their rental payments. They also increased occupancy during Q32020 bringing them to over 97% occupancy. The Safe Harbor acquisition added the recurring revenue from 40,000 slips as well as the highly profitable dry storage business.

Here are a few other factors that make Sun one of the best REITs out there.

* Annual move-out rates at Sun's parks are less than 1%
* The average stay in a Sun mobile home community is 15 years.
* In terms of providing affordable rental housing, Sun's communities cost 53% less per square foot compared to apartments in similar areas.
* The average cost of a mobile home is about 72% less than the average cost of a single-family home. 
* They're a REIT that owns a lot of acreage (waterfront at that).  As land starts to become more and more valuable, those rents are going to start climbing.

There are way more ways that Sun crushes other REITs [here](https://suncommunities.gcs-web.com/static-files/f6553a93-8b26-436c-89bf-9e165f15f81a) 

SUI announces earnings in a couple of weeks and it is currently trading about $30 below its 52 week high. Last quarter's earnings were about $0.40 higher than Q12020 and that doesn't even count the revenue from Safe Harbors.   The kicker is that Sun's business has only improved since last year.  The stock's price is where it is, in my opinion, due to lack of interest and therefore low volume.

1264,"The opportunity for a massive silver rally, one of the most shorted investment assets on the planet",Discussion,2430,l7o7sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l7o7sj/the_opportunity_for_a_massive_silver_rally_one_of/,1611911910.0,"Recently I had uploaded a post regarding the investment opportunity for silver, where I go into the base investment case for this precious/industrial hybrid metal. It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvs2ow/silver_way_more_than_just_a_precious_metal_and_an/)

In short, there is a massive and growing amount of demand for silver. This is partly due to the fears of inflation and devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies around the world, but mostly (60% of it to be exact) comes from industrial usage. People mention, and rightly so, the growing emphasis on solar, electrical vehicles and the computerization of nearly everything. What do all these things have in common? They need silver and substantially more of it the more demand for these products grows.

With demand growing and no way to easily scale up supply (see previous post on why), we are looking at quite and attractive industrial supply/demand story backed up by the fact that it is a precious metal and often moves in tandem with gold.

Now, onto the title, the short interest. We have seen an incredible amount of media attention for what happened to GS and the hedge funds that tried to short the stock, but a somewhat similar case can be made for the silver sector. [This article puts it best.](https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand)

""The 8 big shorts have been “lucky” so far, that their predicament isn’t widely recognized. I’m sure that a small number of sophisticated investors are aware of the plight of the 8 big shorts. But the simple truth is that there has been no mention of the concentrated short position in COMEX gold and silver futures by any mainstream media source. Even on the Internet, the concentrated short position is hardly mentioned. There seems to be a growing groundswell of opinion that silver is the cheapest asset around (it is) and I’m even starting to hear some ask why silver is so cheap to begin with? Let me make it easy for you – the only reason silver is so cheap is because of the concentrated short position of the 4 biggest traders, who hold more than 312 million ounces short, as of the latest COT report. When combined with the next 4 largest traders, the concentrated short position grows to nearly 404 million ounces. The connection couldn’t be more direct. Silver is the cheapest because its short position is the largest.""

In the debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this has always been biased statements by the bullion dealers. SLV is ran by BlackRock, who have many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk?

Some years ago (in the darkest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Buttler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding os one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Buttler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till ""simbolic"" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessed silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds Oz Moz over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise.

SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the one with the biggest and arguably most corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will not be threated and because of that will do nothing, as they only stand to benefit from it.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

- Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)

- Much more liquid

- And of course, it has options!!


As you can see, what we have here is a combination of an important precious and industrial metal that is being held short to a significant extent, with an extremely attractive supply/demand case for the coming decade to be made as well. Make sure to do your own research on this as well, but in my opinion it is clear that this market is ready to go much higher. Best of luck to all of you and have a good and healthy rest of your day!",605,stocks

Now I got an email from my broker telling me they're raising the margin requirement up to 100%. I called them to ask if I understood those changes correctly:

I have 50 shares, currently worth $16250. If I cover 100% of my buy in cost for $100, I need to have $5000 in my account. This way, if the stock goes to zero, I eat all the losses and my broker is fine.

Now they told me on the phone this was wrong, and I had to cover 100% of the current worth. Meaning I must have $16250 in cash in the account. I don't have that. I told them this didn't make any sense to me, since I would have to sell half of my positions to just be able to hold the other half. And if the price went up, I'd have to sell even more. They confirmed that.

Now is that really how this works? Makes zero sense to me. Feedback much appreciated.

Usually the cash required is only about 5% of the value however due to extreme volatility they can increase this cash required to 100%. So the brokerage can run out of cash and can no longer put buy orders through because they need to wait T+2 days until they can use the users cash.

# Option Analysis

Since it's Friday, I'll keep this short and simple. On Sunday night I'll be making another post that will cover a much broader range of data to prepare for the week. The objective today is to get a general idea of what's going on.

Here are the aggregate numbers for the most popular NTM/OTM options -

|Type|Strike Price|Volume|Covered Calls Volume|Open Interest|Open Interest Change (24hr)|Open Interest % LEAPS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$5|302,914|302,914|750,280|164.36%|43.01%|
|Call|$7|178,382|178,382|650,039|N/A|51.57%|
|Call|$10|198,960|198,960|727,640|N/A|41.71%|
|Put|$5|37,384|N/A|216,167|108.53%|50.04%|
|Put|$7|10,764|N/A|84,215|N/A|64.70%|
|Put|$10|1,469|N/A|7,935|N/A|53.79%|

 ^(What is LEAPS?) [^(Long Term Equity Anticipation Security)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp) 

Here are the aggregate numbers for LEAPS -

|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|961,418|85.21%|
|Put LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|166,915|14.79%|

Here are the aggregate numbers for Short Term Options -

|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Term Calls|($5, $7, $10)|1,166,541|89.19%|
|Short Term Puts|($5, $7, $10)|141,402|10.81%|

^(Short Term Options are option contracts that expire in less than 12 months. In this case, the dates range from 29 January  to 16 July.)

What we can learn from these numbers -

1. Long term market sentiment for $NOK is *extremely* bullish. **85.21% of LEAPS options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7 and $10 over the next 12+ months.**
2. Short term market sentiment is also *extremely* high. **89.19% of short term options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7, and $10 over the next 6 months.**
3. There is still a relatively high volume of Put Options at $5, which may be part of the reason we see such high volatility around that price. Beyond $5, the ratio of Puts to Calls gets slimmer, which will likely lead to better stability as prices rises.
4. Today's option volume was very high for Calls, and 100% of those Calls were covered. I wouldn't expect much gamma ramping (sudden upward jumps in price) as we go forward.
5. Trade volume of shares was \~350 million today. This is significantly lower than the weekly highs which exceeded 1 billion. This is likely why we saw only small movements. There were also quite a few sell-offs as the price reached a high of $5.22.

# Nokia's Growing Business

I'll keep this section short and sweet like I promised. All of these links come from [Nokia's Investor Relations News](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-and-stock-exchange-releases/).

Here is Nokia's [Financial Calendar](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/22/nokia-corporation-financial-calendar-for-2021/). This is good stuff to keep track of if you are investing for the long haul.

I'm just gonna list off a handful of big things that have occurred so far in January 2021 -

* [Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/)

The list goes on and on. There is *so much more* that isn't listed here. A lot of these new developments will start taking effect in Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, which can lead to major growth.

# Finances Summary

For a full look at the finances and a comparison with Qualcomm and Ericsson, check out [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/). I'm just gonna summarize what was said over there.

||$NOK Data (Converted to USD)|
|:-|:-|
|Book Value| $47.43 Billion|
|Total Debt| $6.43 Billion |
|Repayment of Debt| $542 Million |
|Free Cash Flow| $2.35 Billion |
|Net Revenue TTM| $890 Million |
|Operating Income| $2.09 Billion |
|Market Value|**\~$24 Billion**|

In Part III we did a comparison between Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ericsson. Based on the numbers, it's pretty apparent how undervalued Nokia is compared to the competition - both of whom boast very similar finances. I again urge you to read [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/) on the finances for a better explanation.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

# TL;DR

Market sentiment for $NOK is extremely high as we get ready to move into earnings week. Trade volume of shares has gone down, while option volume and open interest has trended upwards. 

Financial data and press releases from Nokia indicate that the company is expecting to perform very well in the long term, with an abundance of new business coming in.

I would again encourage you to read my other posts. They all include TL;DRs for the lazy.

You may switch to a cash account by contacting customer service. This can be done through the app.

There are a few headlines to consider... some say it was hedgefunds selling to cover their losses, others say it was the J&J trials posting results that fell below expectations, and others say we are at the beginning of a complete crash (maybe a correction, but a complete crash is unlikely).  Ultimately, for the investor sell-offs can be healthy and can present buying opportunities.  Full disclosure, I haven't bought a single share of GME, AMC, BB, or NOK.  I have my eyes set on other buying opportunities--opportunities that I think will continue to pay off in the long run.  These are stocks where I slightly increased my positions in today and will continue to consider buying next week depending on how the markets play out.  **Even when you see a buying opportunity, you don't all-in on one given day.  You don't know what the next day/week/month will look like.**

&#x200B;

1. **WMT:**  WMT has had a \~7% dip since hitting 150.  WMT has plans to really ramp up its presence in the advertising industry, which, in my opinion, has a lot of potential.  WMT has 250M customers on a weekly basis, globally.  They are planning to release their consumer data to companies, which would be an incredible source of information for those in the ad industry. To compare, Amazon tallied about 26M transactions per week which is about 182 M per week.  WMT has made it clear that it wants to increase its revenue from ads 10+ times within the next 5 years.
2. **Apple:** INCREDIBLE earnings beat.  Can't emphasize that enough.  There is so much already publicized about Apple's amazing quarter.  Yet, the price has fallen \~8%.  It's likely that Apple has more room to grow as Apple has announced that they'd be producing their own chips.  Consumers who are looking for a computer upgrade, are likely to hold until Apple's newest technology comes out.  Tim Cook is always looking to push Apple's presence and innovation.  I'm looking to increase my position in Apple.
3. **Visa:**  Another great earnings beat followed by a sell-off.  I'm looking at this as a great buying opportunity.  This is more of a macro trend play.  Visa did well given its boost in consumers shopping online.  I can only see a company like Visa doing better as cities begin to open up once the pandemic begins to clear.  There's a pent up demand to travel, to be out, to buy into experiences that we haven't been able to do for almost a year now.  Visa's fintech plays may not have worked out, but Visa is here to stay.

Let customers buy the “GameStock,” play the game as long as they want, and then resell the game rights on your market.

1319,Current Markets and Why,Discussion,10,l8fk52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8fk52/current_markets_and_why/,1611987460.0,"Evening everyone,

I am about to tell you the problem with the current climate in two words. Liquidity crisis.

For the past few days the shorts were slowly liquidating their positions in other stocks, to pay the interest associated with shorting. By doing so there is a dip almost everywhere. There has been talk that all the brokerages that stopped or restricted the purchase of certain securities is in cahoots with the hedge funds. That is likely true when 40% of RH's revenue comes from Citadel (guys involved with shorting GME) but I am here to explain how a transaction works and the relation to liquidity. Because just as much as we want to get at the big guy, we also have to think about the broader market.

In every transaction there is always a winner and loser. If the losers can't pay then the broker has to pay out of pocket to the clearinghouse (this makes the brokerage the loser as well as you, you have to pay it back). The problem here is not just retail. There are funds and perhaps even the Fed buying up GME to prop up the price. Level 2 data recently will show you the orders are in the thousands at a time for GME, at the price of $300 retail orders consist of maybe 1-3 shares. Another issue is people are taking out their savings into this stock. RH from my understanding has a relaxed margin requirement and most of their customers are in their 20s. With relaxed margin, young individuals looking for quick easy cash are borrowing the money and gambling with it. When they lose and can't pay because they over leveraged, the broker is on the hook for the money. Also another issue is the calls being exercised yesterday. If they were to be exercised then the brokerage has to issue those shares to them, but with the demand and there being no shares to offer they are desperately trying to buy whatever they possible can. It explains why there was only the ""Sell"" option available. While they lost at their own game, it doesn't take away from what may occur to investments outside of GME or any other meme stock, **if a large part of margin borrowing ends up defaulting**.",12,stocks
1320,GME Thoughts,,0,l8vywv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8vywv/gme_thoughts/,1612041487.0,"I wanted to share a couple of thoughts about GME from a couple of different perspectives.

Please, let me know where I'm off. I would really appreciate some different prospectives.

**GME Executive**

I've read that insiders hold 7% or so of GME. If you are a GME employee, you want to sell your shares today. If your an executive, your $1,000,000 options are now worth $150,000,000. If you are a mid-level executive, your options just went from $300,000 to $45,000,000.

You have no investment in the short squeeze on r/wallstreetbets and you just want to retire. These folks are going to sell if they are not in a lockup period. Many of them might have already liquidated, which would be good for the holders, but if large ones have not, that's a problem.

At 6.8% of outstanding shares, they would hold $1.32 billion in market cap. That's a lot for r/wallstreetbets investors to buy up.

**GME Corporate Development**

Now is the refinancing opportunity of a lifetime. Your company has a market cap of $22 billion dollars. It might be worth $1 billion dollars. If you can do a round of equity financing while the price is high, you might buy the business a lot of runway and help make it competitive.

You should have Latham & Watkins on speed dial next week. Your real goal is to sell new shares to the short sellers to raise funding or to other large investors that can then sell them to the short sellers. You can cover their shorts at $20-$50 / share. It would be a big win for the short sellers and a big win for the company.

**Vanguard / Blackrock**

I've read large institutional investors hold a lot of GME stock. If they hold large enough positions, they don't want to trade it on the open market because if you start to sell the price will drop like a stone because the ordinary investors can't purchase the volume.

So, you want to make a deal directly with the short sellers allowing them to cover. That way you can make sure that your sale doesn't cause the price to drop and so affect your ability to enjoy the benefit of the short squeeze.

You can sell your shares at $20-$50 and still make a huge profit.

I'm from Australia and have done some research about what brokers I can use but all their apps have very poor reviews or high fees and that's kinda important factors for me.

What's everyone experience like with the various brokers and their apps available from my region like Interactive Brokers, CommSec, eToro etc etc. I'm hoping there are others here that have used these. Your opinions are welcome. Thanks.",12,stocks
