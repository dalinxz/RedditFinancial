- Warning! In the interest of mitigating risk for our clients, we have temporarily placed GameStop and AMC Entertainment in reduce-only mode as highly unusual volumes have led to an unprecedented market environment. New positions cannot be opened, existing ones can be reduced or closed. -

Not sure if they are really concerned about their customers, or they've been lobbied by hedge funds to prevent ordinary people from destroying them. I don't care about GME and AMC, I have no position, but now I am angry for this decision. They always go against the poor individuals and let the billionaires save their asses. No one saves us when we go bankrupt by them.

Let's use this thread to discuss the GameStop situation this weekend, please don't open new threads about it unless it is a unique perspective or brings very valuable information.

Do note, posts and comments are still restricted to users with a higher Karma and account age.

##Important information

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

I started out with almost zero, and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year, I was able to completely change my life around. I used to think that if I worked hard, did my due diligence, traded smartly, I could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams. Something has shifted now. I no longer feel the same way, and I'm not sure if I ever will again.

I wonder if it's naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair. I'm not American so I wasn't aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008, but it seems that many people are equating what's happening now to back then, calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor.

They can crash multiple brokerages at the same time, disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously, manipulate price action in real-time by changing the supply/demand, unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted. We've always understood that the media was manipulated, but it was up to us if we wanted to listen. But our direct purchase of stocks, and outright price action manipulation, suddenly it feels very personal.

It just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that I've enjoyed and come to love so much, is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want, at any time they want in favor of their own interests. I came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement, and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities. I'm sad to think that I may never have this outlook again, in light of everything that's been coming out.  Just looking for words of encouragement right now. I love investing and I don't want that joy to be taken from me

7,Biden to announce Stimulus in the “trillions” on Thursday,,18046,ku2ymw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku2ymw/biden_to_announce_stimulus_in_the_trillions_on/,1610237516.0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/biden-calls-for-quick-pandemic-relief-minimum-wage-increase


This is going to be interesting. On one hand, it may not pass due to Joe Manchin, but I think Biden will be proposing a $2-$3T stimulus this Thursday. He also supports another round of checks but this time for $2k. Based on the numbers, $400b of the “trillions” in stimulus is just on the $2k checks. 

Rumors are he will also throw in a lot of clean energy and EV subsidies in there too. Possibly in the tens of billions.

8,Sign The Petition: Retail Investors Demand Market Transparency! Make the Hedge Funds report their Shorts!,Off-Topic,16674,l7l2xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l7l2xj/sign_the_petition_retail_investors_demand_market/,1611900378.0,"**Sign the petition here: https://www.change.org/sec-amend-13-f**


Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

According to subscription analytics firm Antenna, Netflix cancellations surged 5x the normal amount following the release of “Cuties.”

Meanwhile, Data analytics firm YipitData reported a similar trend, with the company telling Yahoo Finance that Netflix’s U.S. churn “rose materially” last weekend in the wake of the controversy. As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August — a multi-year high, YipitData added.

Still, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space — regardless of its recent controversies.

13,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,Discussion,7708,ipp3e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,1599685339.0,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash. We are seeing [record insider selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/investing/insider-selling-stocks-market/index.html), but most publicly, it began with Tesla announcing they would sell $5bn in [new shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/tesla-to-sell-up-to-5-billion-in-stock-amid-rally.html). Their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently ""[rebalancing](https://fortune.com/2020/09/04/tesla-stock-rally-investors-selling-outlook/)"" their portfolio to sell many Tesla shares as well. This was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market, even though it did anyway. I will get more in depth on this phase later. The biggest catalyst was [Softbank](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-dives-6-u-tech-004748400.html), though, and that leads me to the final stage.
5. **Panic Selling**: This is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can. We are currently witnessing this. The last few days have been a trainwreck on the market, wiping out August's gains entirely.

Now I know you want to say ""well look at today. We're up 2% in the S&P!"" This is par for the course on a crash. With the Corona crash, these were the rough day to day movement patterns (I'm using Corona as an example for its shortness/simplicity but all crashes have similar patterns):

* 1 small loss day 
* 2 BIG loss days 
* 3 medium loss days 
* 5 ***gain days*** (there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the March crash) 
* 1 GIANT loss day 
* 3 Sideways days 
* 8 slightly down days, leading to the bottom 

Of those gain days, the first was a slowdown, but the second was a change of 4.8% in S&P/SPY from an open of 294 to a close of 309. Consecutive, positive days occurred during every major crash. We can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting. Don't be fooled by positive days. That does NOT indicate the crash is over. Novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat. Crashes take weeks, minimum, but **usually months, if not years**, to become fully realized. Covid's crash is the fastest we've had at one month.

Another trend I've noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster. The late 80's Japanese market crash took 6 years to play out. The 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years. The Chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years. The 2008 oil bubble took 1 year. On the flipside, the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years. The 2008 energy bubble took 3 years. We're about 6 months into this current bubble, but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid. Maybe this means nothing, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Bubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse. I've been seeing these called ""violent shake-offs."" Most crashes get one, but some get two. We had one with the June mini-crash. One could argue that this current crash could be a violent shake-off. I'll get to the alternate scenario later. Assuming it's not, which I don't think it is, we move to the final trigger, the catalyst.

**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank. They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

To those who don't know, Softbank bought $4 billion in options during the early days of the market post-covid. These options are worth a fortune right now ($30bn estimated), but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on. What everyone is afraid of is Softbank doing just that, or worse, for shareholders: holding through a market crash and losing it all. In the movie, Margin Call (great movie), a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold EVERYTHING they had in order to get ahead of it, single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash. To be fair, this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion, but it's really just mentioned to illustrate my point. Softbank has to exercise these options, which have strike prices likely WAY below market value. If they sell those shares, they could easily double their investment, even through a crash. The problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that Softbank lost over $15 billion in market cap (currently at $112bn). Had this not happened, the speed at which we decline would've been much slower. They have to make those losses up now. You know what would do that? Exercising all their options and selling them for market gains.

They can't keep those options forever, either. At best they have 2 years. Softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market, but if it keeps dipping, they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically, promoting a panic selling cycle. And what are we in? A panic selling cycle.

If this cycle continues with Softbank, more will tack on and we'll see this bubble continue to collapse. If it can hold a recovery this week, it might survive, but of course, I don't think it will. The end of day today really showed that people *are* afraid and that given any opportunity, selloff will occur. I think this IS the crash. But, I could be wrong. That brings me to the second and third catalysts.

**Commercial Real Estate Crash**: The eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy. It's brushed under the rug pretty heavily, pointing to the home real estate market and its gains, but the damage is done. Most major commercial real estate buildings, especially apartments, are in disarray. Go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering. Where I am, I'm seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places. I've never seen that before. Everyone is desperate for paying tenants. Most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing, but we haven't seen anything like this. Small businesses are shutting down, new businesses are not opening. No one is shopping. Who replaces those lost tenants? All these properties are heavily in debt. That's how the industry works, for the most part. Entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and it's a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment. The margins had become abysmal before corona. I once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that I would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing, to make anything worthwhile. This will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast. There is a commercial real estate collapse coming, likely within 6 months, and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done. Don't forget that this isn't strictly a US problem. This is a worldwide problem.

**Vacation Industry Crash:** Many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat. This, in turn, boosts GDP. Malaysia, for instance, is a place I personally visited, during Covid, and it was a desolate wasteland. Most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer. It was like this for blocks and blocks. Huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people. It's only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses. The country in Malaysia I visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants, during the best of times. Now, they are lucky to get any customers. That affect will bleed into the second catalyst. More businesses going under, causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them, causing those buildings to go under, causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant, unprofitable properties, causing them to go under.

Even with a vaccine, we won't go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses. The airline industry is reporting that they don't estimate returns to normal until late 2021, early 2022. Do you think a random Joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought? The people at the bottom of the chain, consumers and small business owners, were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives. That *is* going to trickle up to the top and when it does, goodbye market.

Of course, there's also the US election, but that will be a small catalyst as far as I'm concerned.

\------------------------------------------------

Other notable indicators/insights that things don't look good:

1. Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.
2. Google trend results for ""Market Crash"" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.
3. An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.
4. EVs are the new dotcom company. Many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated.
5. High growth, high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies, despite stock prices pretending they do. For example, Sea Ltd. doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in Q2 2020. eToys is a prime example of this, from the dotcom bust era. Had huge revenue, but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business, despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good.
6. The PE ratio of the market is above 30, which has historically always resulted in a market crash.
7. Apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today. Prior to that was around 600k peak. This happened for MOST tech stocks.
8. If you bought Microsoft at peak dotcom bust, you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven (longer if you account for inflation losses). That kind of stagnation is what we're looking at, even today.

\------------------------------------------------

This does NOT mean the entire market will crash. Quite the contrary. Yes, most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors (TECH) brings down the whole thing, but they will stay high if priced fairly. Most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area, for instance, and will weather the storm quite well. At least, until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them.

Plan accordingly, set stop losses, and do your own research. I don't expect you to just follow my information blindly. I may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires. You need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call. I simply hope to raise awareness for what I believe is a market crash so that people don't lose their shirt during this. I hope I'm wrong, though I'm literally betting with my money that I'm not.

Good luck.",1681,stocks

I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn't cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn't. I slowly started seeing results.

18,GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity,Discussion,6064,l3e54f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l3e54f/gme_infinite_gamma_squeeze_gap_in_option_market/,1611415995.0,"# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

“The sudden, sharp surge in GameStop’s share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze, given the high short interest, and, to a lesser degree, speculation by retail investors on forecasts for the new gaming cycle and the involvement of activist RC Ventures,” Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said in the note on Monday.

GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer, has been a popular short target on Wall Street. In fact, more than 138% of its float shares had been borrowed and sold short, the single most shorted name in the U.S. stock market, according to FactSet citing the latest filings.",591,stocks
21,I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter,Resources,5468,kumtz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kumtz1/i_built_a_program_that_spots_buzzing_stocks_on/,1610312291.0,"Following my comment on this sub 3 days ago, many of you have been asking me to share the stock picks from this program I have built that scrapes Reddit and Twitter for emerging stocks. So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can't publish them here. However, I still wanted to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**Before I share the picks of this week with you below, please consider reading this crucial preamble. That should answer your questions and avoid misconceptions.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed meme stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.
* I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: For those who are worried that this will only surface PnD penny stocks, I have taught my program how to flag picks that are highly correlated with terms associated with PnD schemes (“moon”, “pump”, “dump” etc.). I still have to add a level of human curation to the algorithmic results, doing my own DD on the stocks I highlight, but my goal is to have the program do all the work in the future so there isn’t any biases coming in.

**2nd Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

28,To Everyone Telling the Amazon Kid to Diversify,Discussion,4950,jn9zew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jn9zew/to_everyone_telling_the_amazon_kid_to_diversify/,1604409002.0,"If you’re 21 with the financial ability to drop $16k in the market, the risk-return of betting big on one company makes more sense. Everyone saying “VOO, SPY, etc. is much smarter; NEVER go more than 10% on one position” is being a bit ignorant in my opinion. 

Diversification preserves wealth, concentration creates it. There’s nothing wrong with taking a higher percent stake in a company that you believe will outperform the broader market.

“SEARS used to be Amazon, what happened to that?” Sears didn’t drop to 0 in a day. Follow your investments accordingly. However, I have yet to see Amazon being disrupted like Sears was years ago.

I had a weird feeling in my gut. I knew the next stop would be Jupiter, I just... couldn’t help but feel like ”we had arrived”.

So after thinking about it long and hard, going back and forth, I decided to cash out and get off this reusable masterpiece of a rocketship. It had taken me and my SO safely from Earth to Mars and it was time to get off.

The money we made from TSLA helped us make a down payment on our first apartment, so it went to good use. 

Selling TSLA felt bitter sweet as I love this company, I have a man crush on Papa Musk and I was planning initially to hold my dear TSLA shares “forever”. However, I’m forever grateful to this company as it made buying an apartment possible for me. Believing in it paid off.

Thank you Elon. Thank you TSLA. ❤️

Edit: Thank you guys for all the comments! It is crazy how emotionally attached you can get to a stock. I’ve just spent countless hours studying this company and Elon. I believed in it when so many said I was crazy (or thought it). Elon is a true visionary and I truly believe TSLA is going to continue on its path to greatness.

Also, I wasn’t trying to time the top at all. It’s near impossible to do anyway. I just saw an opportunity, went with my gut feeling and seized it.

Edit 2: I was made aware by e fellow investor that in the US it’s called a condo and not an apartment. I understand if that was confusing! I’m from Europe and here apartments are both for sale and for rent.",1141,stocks

The announcement comes ahead of an expected statement Friday by President Donald Trump on whether or not the government will approve a deal for Oracle to take a minority stake in TikTok and become a “trusted technology partner” for the company in the U.S.

It’s unclear if the Commerce Department’s announcement means there’s no possibility of a deal going through before the Sunday deadline, and it could be an aggressive move from the Trump Administration to push for its original intention for TikTok to be fully owned by a U.S. company.

“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.

Friday’s announcement from the Commerce Department is an enforcement of Trump’s original executive order from August 6 that gave TikTok 45 days to sell its U.S. business to a U.S. company or face a ban in the U.S. WeChat, which is one of the most popular social messaging apps in the world, is owned by the Chinese company Tencent. TikTok’s parent company is the Chinese company ByteDance. Trump’s executive order cited national security concerns over the Chinese government’s access to user data in those apps to justify the potential ban.

The Commerce Department’s statement on Friday said that starting Sept. 20, U.S. companies would be banned from distributing WeChat and TikTok, meaning the two major mobile app stores run by Apple and Google would have to remove the apps from their libraries. The statement also blocks U.S. companies from providing services through WeChat “for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.”

WeChat is a popular marketing and sales tool for U.S. companies primarily in China, but around the world as well. With U.S. social apps like Facebook and Instagram banned in China, WeChat is the primary app people use for social networking and e-commerce. It’s also a popular app used by people in the U.S. to communicate with people in China, since U.S. apps are banned in China.

The Commerce Department’s announcement also lays out a separate time frame specific to TikTok, which take affect on Nov. 12. The rules that start Nov. 12 include provisions that block U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services for TikTok. This could be directed at the deal being negotiated between TikTok and Oracle, which would provide cloud services for TikTok if Trump approves, and could give TikTok and Oracle more time to hammer out a deal that Trump will approve.

Representatives for Tencent, TikTok, WeChat, Apple and Google were not immediately available to comment.

1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They're a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.

2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn't care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.

3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant's online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.

4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn't provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?

5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth \~$100/share.

This IPO was purely a case of ownership taking advantage of timing to raise as much cash as possible.  I wouldn't be surprised if this thing is trading at $30 a year from now.  This is going to be the FIT or GPRO of 2020 IPOs.",956,stocks

44,"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says",News,3877,iqebna,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iqebna/tesla_is_profoundly_overvalued_and_its_exclusion/,1599778400.0,"Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

46,My 8 investing guidelines.,Discussion,3845,kehrkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kehrkg/my_8_investing_guidelines/,1608152176.0,"I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.",315,stocks
47,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,Ticker Discussion,3759,kz682f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kz682f/i_created_an_algo_that_tracks_the_most_hyped/,1610889192.0,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

The wholesale retailer sells a one-year membership to a private jet charter company called Wheels Up, which allows members to book a private jet “as easily as a ride share or short-term vacation rental,” the product description says.

Although the $17,499.99 membership is quite a hefty fee, it also comes with a $3,500 Costco Shop Card and $4,000 worth of flight credit.

Other benefits include “dedicated account management,” a one-year membership with Inspirato, a luxury vacation rental subscription service and “guaranteed nationwide aircraft availability up to 365 days a year,” according to the description.

Members can either buy an additional “Fund Program” with lower rates and lower billable fly times, or they can “pay as they fly,” according to the product description.

The Wheels Up fleet includes more than 300 private aircraft as well as more than 1,250 partner aircraft.

The company also promises enhanced health and safety measures through its “Safe Passage” program, which includes having all Wheels Up aircraft getting an anti-microbial shield treatment at least every 90 days and having all seats and interior surfaces sanitized between every flight, the website says.

The Wheels Up membership can be found online in the “Electronics” category, or in-store with other gift cards, according to The Washington Post.

I think this is a great sign along with Biden's appointment of Yellen as the Treasury Secretary.  The news brings a sense of stability in that there will be a smooth transition of power and Yellen apparently has a track record of focusing on economic growth as a true economist as opposed to giving into political leanings.

While I am not one to boldly predict how the markets will react the rest of this week and there is still uncertainty given the rise in cases and the lack of stimulus... at least there are fewer variables to worry about.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

""If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,"" Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**""Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,"" Yellen said at the hearing. ""And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.""**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in ""full support"" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the ""existential threat"" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.",607,stocks

Palantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.

Later they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.

Palantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.

Palantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.

# Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Institutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.

When it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.

A central operating system for data

Palantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.

Augmenting existing data systems, not displacing

At a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.

Making data actionable

Gotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.

Their ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.

Understand the history of data and decisions

Palantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.

Enable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances

The versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.

Users can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.

Enforce rigorous and reliable data protection

Palantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.

AI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions

Their software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.

The AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.

**Revenue Streams**

Palantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.

Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.

It is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.

Gotham

Its main tools include:

Graph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Ava – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.

Mobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.

Foundry

Monocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.

Contour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

Fusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.

Reports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.

I strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.

Palantir’s Software Example Use Cases

* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.
* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.
* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.
* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.
* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.

# Industry

**Market Size**

As of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.

Currently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.

According to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Embrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted

It has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.

We have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.

Buy or Build

Institutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.

Additionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.

Palantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.

Crisis & Instability

A [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

Palantir’s main competitors include:

Internal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.

And two software companies with very similar business models:

[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.

[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.

**Competitive Strategy**

Customer acquisition

Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.

Additionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.

Software engineers on the front line

In order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.

Leverage experience in both private and public sector

To the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.

Palantir’s strategic relationships last for years

By the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.

Palantir has chosen sides

Their software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.

**Growth Strategy**

Become the industry default

Palantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.

This model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.

Continue to grow their direct sales force

Palantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

Increase their reach with existing customers

To drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:

* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers
* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities
* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases

For Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.

Become the default operating system for the U.S. government

Palantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.

Palantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.

New methods of customer acquisition and partnership

As Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.

For example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.

**Moats**

R&D expenditure

Since 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.

Network effects

Every data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.

At a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.

Additionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.

In addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.

Regulation

Section 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.

In 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Privacy and civil liberties

Palantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.

Customer concentration

For the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.

**Income Statement**

[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)

Palantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.

For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:

* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.
* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).
* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Palantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.

# Investment Decision

**Valuation Results**

[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)

The result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**

Mayor assumptions of the valuation model include:

* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.
* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.
* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.
* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%

Follow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.

**Investment Decision**

I believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:

* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.
* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.
* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.",408,stocks

- When you don’t buy it keeps going up
- When you buy is when it drops
- After you sell at a loss it goes back up

For some reason the market goes against your decisions. It’s taunting and laughing at you. It’s chosen you specifically and while Yahoo convos question “I don’t get it—why is this stock down today?” you know why.

WSB used to be a funny little subreddit in which you could discuss serious DD and also post your losses on stupid trades (no upvotes for green accounts), now it's some kind of weird echo chamber and it's suddenly ""cool"" to be part of it and also take part in every stupid idea people there come up with, not to mention it's toxic, e.g. harrassing Andrew Left is not okay, you might not agree with him, but he has made some valid points most people don't even want to consider because of mob mentality, just the keep the insults out of this sub please.

It feels like the same kind of people are now slowly taking over this sub, sorting posts by ""new"" is pointless because the same stupid questions that could be answered with a 10 second Google search are asked every 10 minutes, if you don't have the patience for that, or even reading the sidebar you shouldn't be able to post here and spam this sub because it drowns the few actually interesting questions and discussions that don't concern Gamestop, Palantir or Blackberry or gambling away your family's life savings. The worst thing is that people who have no clue get positively reinforced by members of this sub ""yeah totally yolo all your savings into GME"". This is not WSB, people should at least put some thought into their posts.

The moderators should be a lot tougher again and curate the sub more, keep out the toxicity, make sure people get useful advice and are not lead into financial ruin (some can't tell the difference between irony and serious advice). Several uses have suggested to put more of an emphasis on to FAQ and Q&A sections as well, many people already use the daily threads and and post good questions and discussions, let's increase its use.

The quality has deteriorated so much, I almost don't feel like scrolling through the sub anymore.

Excuse the wall of text but it's been bothering me for a while now, anybody else feel the same way or am I just delusional?

67,Sharing my top companies with you.,,3024,fyjaff,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fyjaff/sharing_my_top_companies_with_you/,1586536709.0,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

69,Home Depot is spending $1 billion to give thousands of its workers a raise,News,2953,jw80m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jw80m4/home_depot_is_spending_1_billion_to_give/,1605669165.0,"Sitting on bumper profits and cash as consumers remodel their homes during the pandemic, Home Depot ([HD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD?p=HD&.tsrc=fin-srch)) is joining a growing list of big box retailers giving its workers a raise after a busy and challenging year during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The home improvement retailer said Tuesday it will invest $1 billion in what it calls ‘incremental compensation’ annually for its workers. A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company’s average hourly wage will increase after the investment.

“It varies market by market. Our compensation, at all levels, is based on skills, responsibilities, performance and market rates,” the spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. [According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour. A sales associate earns $12 an hour, per Glassdoor.

The spokesperson said the “majority” of Home Depot’s 400,000 total employees will receive a pay bump from the new investment.

Other big box chains — sitting on big profits as consumers have stocked up on food and cleaning products amidst the pandemic — have also opened their wallets.

In July, [Target raised its starting wage for its store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-raises-minimum-wage-for-store-distribution-and-headquarter-employees-114504219.html), distribution and headquarter employees to $15 an hour. The move impacted 275,000 employees who work at the company’s stores and distribution centers. Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.

Walmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.

The world’s largest retailer’s pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.

“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said recently at the [Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit](https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit/).

Bezos has accelerated his stock sales in the last year. In August, Bezos offloaded more than $3.1 billion of Amazon shares, after selling more than $4.1 billion worth of shares in February. The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to more than $10.2 billion so far, which is a notable jump from 2019, when Bezos sold $2.8 billion worth of shares.

Even with the latest stock sale, Bezos still owns more than 53 million shares worth nearly $170 billion, making him the richest person in the world.

The transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings. Amazon declined to comment on the latest sale.

Bezos has previously said he sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year to fund his rocket start-up, Blue Origin. Additionally, the Amazon CEO in February launched a $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change, which will issue grants to scientists, activists and other organizations.

While Bezos hasn't yet announced the recipients of the fund, The Atlantic reported Tuesday that Bezos is expected to give $100 million each to the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund.

USPS delivered 1.54 billion packages for Amazon during the time period, or roughly 30% of the technology company's total volume, according to the documents, which also show that deliveries and revenue increased in fiscal year 2019.

Simply put, in return for the lower rates, the USPS keeps a large customer, and staves off a possible future in which Amazon builds out its own delivery fleet, including drone deliveries for rual areas, to the extent it doesn't need the USPS's delivery network — or even begins competing with USPS to deliver some non-Amazon packages as well.

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year.

The 1,031 Tyson employees confirmed to have the coronavirus included workers who were tested at the plant during the shutdown as well as at private health-care providers, Black Hawk County public officials said.

Reynolds said Wednesday that 444 workers at Tyson's Waterloo plant had tested positive.

The others were Tyson pork processing plants in Columbus Junction and Perry, and an Iowa Premium beef processing plant in Tama.Joshua Pikora, disease surveillance and investigation manager in Black Hawk County, where the Waterloo plant is located, said the governor's numbers for Waterloo reflected tests conducted only at the Tyson plant, not at health facilities elsewhere.

Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, and Tom Hart, the Waterloo plant manager, detailed the added measures the company has taken to ensure worker safety.

They point to the terrible economic numbers and worsening social situation. But they are missing the point.

The stock market is going up because the value of the US currency, relative to productive assets, is going down. When the Fed prints trillions, and the amount of assets stays the same or declines at a rate lower than the increase in currency, this inflate asset prices. It's not captured in inflation numbers because of the way CPI is calculated and because of how these new supply of currency is distributed. We saw this after the financial crisis -- not much inflation in consumer goods, but massive inflation in housing and the stock market.

The stock market will continue to go up as long as the Fed continues to increase the supply of currency faster than the decline in earnings.

Source: me. I manage money.

\*\*\*

Edit: Also look at gold, for example GLD. It's going up. All limited assets are going up because the USD is losing value. Since the USD is a key reserve currency with \~ 2/3 share, a lot of foreigners are subsidizing US asset owners. I learned this from Ray Dalio.

Also, I don't like gold. Why? Because its value as a currency & store of value has greatly been reduced by innovation in financial technology. What are you going to do, pay with gold? I don't think so. It is my view that equities of top tier companies, given it's liquidity and scarcity, is a better store of value and a better currency than gold.

Again, the world isn't crazy, most people just don't understand that currencies are being devalued relative to securities.

\*\*\*

Edit 2: So why are riots good for the market. One, it limits the US government's ability to escalate geopolitical issues, which means less screwing around with the supply chain, which is good for large cap stocks, which drives the indices that we call ""the market"". Two, unrest will incentivize the government to stimulate on the monetary and fiscal front.

\*\*\*

Edit 3: I read every comment and there are a lot of confusion out there. A big one is that many are still holding on to the traditional definition of inflation, as in the CPI, which is a basket of goods and services. Yes, CPI does not suggest we are having inflation in the narrow way inflation is defined by it. When the Fed, for example, buys treasuries, they create new money which is deposited in the bank account of the treasury seller. These treasury sellers tend to be large institutions and very wealthy people, so they are not spending that money on goods and services (i.e. CPI items) but instead using that money to buy investment assets (corporate bonds, stocks, gold, etc -- which are NOT CPI items). This is why price for goods and services are not rising as fast as the price of investment assets.

The second confusion is if the USD is losing value, why is it appreciating against other currencies. I am strictly talking about USD losing value relative to assets like corporate equity, so it is a totally different matter. The USD vs. other currencies is huge topic that I can't possibly cover here. Basically, the USD, as the dominant reserve currency backed by the biggest and most stable economy, is viewed as a safe haven so demand for USD increases when risk increases. So although the Fed is printing a lot of money, in the short term, demand for USD relative to other currencies still leads to the strengthening of the dollar. Also keep in mind that several other developed countries, for example Japan, have negative rates. So although the USD strengthens against other currencies, it weakens relative to investment assets -- hence asset price inflation.

Many of Tesla’s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",739,stocks

""Damn, I should've poured my entire fucking life savings into $BITCH when I saw that DD post on it a week ago""
""I should've just held, sold way too early and now it's up $3""
Been seeing a lot of posts along the lines of these statements for the past few weeks.  The volatility of the market bestowing random lotto wins upon a handful of risk takers, who then proceed to (justifiably) claim bragging rights along with their newfound cash isn't helping the issue.  People will, of course, daydream themselves into a similar scenario, and the likelihood of a large, UNeducated gamble increases with each ""missed"" opportunity perceived.  

For those of you who are in your university years or a little past, we're looking at most likely a baseline hourly wage of $12.50 (CA assumption).  This is what you'd be standing on your feet for 8 hours a day to earn, a daily intake of roughly $80 after taxes, all the while dealing with the dumb shit that presents itself in every entry level position.  

Did your trade today result in a profit greater than $80?  Congratulations, you have no cause to be regretful.  Did your profit for the week average out to greater than $400?  Nice, you just made a week's salary without enduring the arduous process of punching in a time card every day.  Maybe you made double, triple that, quadruple, or even 10 times that in the span of a week or less.  You should be ecstatic; you just earned several months' paychecks in a fraction of the time and with a sliver of the work.  Maybe you have an actual job on top of this windfall; now you've doubled your financial stability (or more) and that out of state trip with your friends is no longer unrealistic. Of course within the lens of Reddit's investing discourse, taking away 1 to 4 grand when your play could have, if left alone, increased to 15 or 20 grand, might make you feel a bit empty for a while.  But outside of this context and in the world of wage workers, securing that much in such a short time span is so ridiculously fortunate; several of my university acquaintances slave terrible hours for minimum wage to make tuition or rent payments, and it would take them months to assemble what you and I may consider, in all our eagerness, a ""small"" profit. A trade that, in our view, was pulled too early would be enough to make them speechless.

Maybe the stock or contract climbs after you sell.  So long as you beat your working average, consider it a win.  Don't think ""what if"".  Just count your cash.

Edit: Thanks for the award! 🌵

Edit 2: Thanks for the kind words. Never expected a response of this magnitude when typing my thoughts out.  Just hope that this way of thinking might lessen the sting we've all felt of ""what could have been"", and in time, make peace with having a bird in the hand entirely, rather than any number of them in the bush.",243,stocks

105,"The opportunity for a massive silver rally, one of the most shorted investment assets on the planet",Discussion,2443,l7o7sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l7o7sj/the_opportunity_for_a_massive_silver_rally_one_of/,1611911910.0,"Recently I had uploaded a post regarding the investment opportunity for silver, where I go into the base investment case for this precious/industrial hybrid metal. It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvs2ow/silver_way_more_than_just_a_precious_metal_and_an/)

In short, there is a massive and growing amount of demand for silver. This is partly due to the fears of inflation and devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies around the world, but mostly (60% of it to be exact) comes from industrial usage. People mention, and rightly so, the growing emphasis on solar, electrical vehicles and the computerization of nearly everything. What do all these things have in common? They need silver and substantially more of it the more demand for these products grows.

With demand growing and no way to easily scale up supply (see previous post on why), we are looking at quite and attractive industrial supply/demand story backed up by the fact that it is a precious metal and often moves in tandem with gold.

Now, onto the title, the short interest. We have seen an incredible amount of media attention for what happened to GS and the hedge funds that tried to short the stock, but a somewhat similar case can be made for the silver sector. [This article puts it best.](https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand)

""The 8 big shorts have been “lucky” so far, that their predicament isn’t widely recognized. I’m sure that a small number of sophisticated investors are aware of the plight of the 8 big shorts. But the simple truth is that there has been no mention of the concentrated short position in COMEX gold and silver futures by any mainstream media source. Even on the Internet, the concentrated short position is hardly mentioned. There seems to be a growing groundswell of opinion that silver is the cheapest asset around (it is) and I’m even starting to hear some ask why silver is so cheap to begin with? Let me make it easy for you – the only reason silver is so cheap is because of the concentrated short position of the 4 biggest traders, who hold more than 312 million ounces short, as of the latest COT report. When combined with the next 4 largest traders, the concentrated short position grows to nearly 404 million ounces. The connection couldn’t be more direct. Silver is the cheapest because its short position is the largest.""

In the debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this has always been biased statements by the bullion dealers. SLV is ran by BlackRock, who have many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk?

Some years ago (in the darkest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Buttler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding os one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Buttler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till ""simbolic"" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessed silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds Oz Moz over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise.

SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the one with the biggest and arguably most corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will not be threated and because of that will do nothing, as they only stand to benefit from it.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

- Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)

- Much more liquid

- And of course, it has options!!


As you can see, what we have here is a combination of an important precious and industrial metal that is being held short to a significant extent, with an extremely attractive supply/demand case for the coming decade to be made as well. Make sure to do your own research on this as well, but in my opinion it is clear that this market is ready to go much higher.

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

Despite a coronavirus shutdown this year that temporarily halted most TV production, Netflix plans to release even more originals in 2021 than in 2020 — which would mark the latest achievement for a company’s whose massive investment in original content inspires both envy and ridicule.

Last year, Netflix spent $15 billion on content, which put its investment even with ViacomCBS (VIAC) but behind Comcast (CMCSA) at $15.4 billion and Disney (DIS), which shelled out $27.8 billion — according to data compiled by Variety. The streaming giant will up its spend this year to $17.3 billion, most of which will go toward original content, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Dan Salmon in January.

Netflix added nearly 26 million subscribers over the first six months of this year, bringing its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 — though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.

128,"Stock-market wizard William O'Neil famously turned $5,000 into $200,000 in just a few years. Here's the 7-part model he uses to sniff out winning stocks.",Discussion,2231,ieax69,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ieax69/stockmarket_wizard_william_oneil_famously_turned/,1598064976.0,"""I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and most of them didn't do too well.""

That's what William O'Neil, the legendary trader and author of ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" told Jack Schwager in a 1989 interview for his classic ""Market Wizards"" series.

Out of frustration, O'Neil took the matter into his own hands. He knew a better way to trade was out there — all he had to do was uncover it. After all, he was seeing an array of fund managers crush the competition.

""Back in 1959, I did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market,"" he said. ""At that time, the Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing only about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed the fund, was doubling the results of all his competitors.""

O'Neil scoured Dreyfus' quarterly reports, searching tirelessly for any commonalities he could apply to his own methodology. After mapping out more than 100 of Dreyfus' stock purchase points, O'Neil hit pay dirt.

""There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real discovery: Not some, not most, but every single stock had been bought when it went to a new high price,"" he said.

That unearthing opened the flood gates. O'Neil knew there were more secrets waiting to be uncovered. 

The search continued. 

O'Neil shifted his focus to the market's biggest winners, trying to connect the dots between the characteristics of certain stocks and their superior performance. Eventually, his research culminated in a simple seven-part model: CANSLIM.

Allow O'Neil to explain:

""Each letter of this name represents one of the seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages, just before they made huge advances,"" he said.

O'Neil's discovery translated to massive profits.

""During 1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three exceptional back-to-back trades — short Korvette, long Chrysler, and long Syntex — he managed to parlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000,"" Schwager said.

Let's take a closer look at O'Neil's famed CANSLIM principles. All quotes below are from O'Neil.

C: 'Current earnings per share'

""The 'C' stands for current earnings per share,"" he said. ""So, our first basic rule in stock selection is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.""

A: 'Annual earnings per share'

""In our studies, the prior five-year average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 24%,"" he said. ""Ideally, each year's earnings per share should show an increase over the prior year's earnings.""

N - 'Something New'

""The 'new' can be a new product or service, a change in the industry, or new management,"" he said. ""In our research we found that 95 percent of the greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories.""

S - 'Shares outstanding'

""Ninety-five percent of the stocks that performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance,"" he said. ""Many institutional investors handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies.""

L - 'Leader or laggard'

""So, another basic rule in stock selection is to pick the leading stocks — the ones with the high relative strength values — and avoid the laggard stocks,"" he said. ""I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks above 80.""

I - 'Institutional sponsorship'

""Leading stocks usually have institutional backing,"" he said. ""However, although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general.""

M - 'Market'

""Three out of four stocks will go in the same direction as a significant move in the market averages,"" he said. ""That is why you need to learn how to interpret price and volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped.""",261,stocks

133,Infinite Short Squeeze Explained | Blue Appron Case Study | GME Infinite Short Squueze,Discussion,2195,l21gpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite_short_squeeze_explained_blue_appron_case/,1611245539.0,"This post will describe the behaviour of an infinite short squeeze using Blue Appron as a case study.  On March 16, 2020.  Blue Appron stock priced moved from 2.30 to 28.00 in ONE DAY.   ***That's an 1100% gain in one day with the stock price.  Options moved over 100000% that day.*** The reason was an infinite short squeeze similar to the one that is happening with GME.

&#x200B;

# Blue Appron Short Interest (SI)

During that period Blue Apron's short interest was 50%.  Blue Apron was running out of cash and shorts piled on.  Then the pandemic happened an people started ordering meal kits en mass, infusing Blue Apron with large inflows of cash.  Fearing, meal kits had become a secular trend like ride sharing, shorts started to cover.  But they soon discovered shares were limited.  So the infinite squeeze happened.  *They had to cover at any price to balance their books when Market makers started to sell off their other positions.*

&#x200B;

# GME Short Interest

Currently GME Short Interest is rumored to be above 100% \[1\].  Thus the environment is similar to the Blue Appron infinite short squeeze.  Namely, there are no shares for GME shorts to cover, once the infinite squeeze occurs and MM forces them to balance their books.

Moreover, the squeeze hasn't happened yet, given that the Short Interest hasn't moved lower.  In fact, it has been rumored short interest has increased as shorts make a last ditch effort to scare off the bulls.  But the markets is aware how the conditions are there for an infinite short squeeze.

&#x200B;

# Behaviour of an Infinite Short Squeeze

The behaviour of an infinite short squeeze (ISS) are violent.  In financial history, the two widely cited cases are the VW infinite squeeze of '08 and the Blue Appron one of '20.  As you can see, infinite short squeezes have been rare because most rational agents would never get themselves into a situation which would lead to an ISS.

When shares can't be covered and stock price increases, shorts are forced to cover by Market Makers.  But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, shorts have to cover at prices that would seem irrational on a cursory glance but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares.  ***Consequently, it is normal to see 1000% increases in one day.  And 100000% gains in 0dte options.***

As more market player realize the infinite short squeeze is inevitable, the tripping point of the squeeze collapses from months to days to hours.   *The only way shorts can alleviate the narrative of inevitably is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).  So as long as GME stock positions are maintained, and more shares are bought, the short squeeze is inevitable.*

Owning stock or options are better than a lottery ticket because the odds are in your favor.

134,Oil stocks - the time is now,Discussion,2172,iexyez,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iexyez/oil_stocks_the_time_is_now/,1598161412.0,"Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

PS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away

TLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets

135,To all young investors,,2168,h7u3dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/h7u3dl/to_all_young_investors/,1591999221.0,"I'm seeing a lot of posts from young investors (as young as 18), taking first steps into the stock market. Of course their capital's very small, often less than $1,000, and they are all excited to make big bucks fast.

I'm just genuinely worried that a lot of these investors are taking the stock market as a place to gamble, and not put any thoughts into the stocks they purchase, and take actions very emotionally. Too many of you are eyeing on penny stocks, or companies that have been beaten down so much from COVID, even filed for Chapter 11. 

Sure you may get very lucky and double your bank account in a week, and think to yourself, ""man I'm a good trader."" I believe there are people out there who are truly good traders. However, chances are that you are not one of them, and 99 percent of yall will lose money if not all in a few months. This is gambling and not any different from taking your $1,000 to Vegas and putting it into a slot machine. 

What I really want to tell you guys is, try to be patient, and buy stocks with a very constructive reasoning behind it. You spend hours thinking about how to spend $20 on clothes or shoes you want to buy. Then, why can't you put just as much thought, if not more, into stocks you will be investing hundreds of dollars in? If you are spending so much money on something, you gotta be able to convince not only yourself, but also your parents, friends, people, with a load of information, take constructive criticism, etc.! 

And really, keep buying, and get a habit of buying often. 1st of every month could be your investing day, and you will transfer like $50 dollars to your account to buy another, i don't know, Coca Cola stock. These small things will add up with the compound law, and in 10 years you won't believe where you are at. (If your initial investment grow 10% every year for 10 years, you will be up 150% in total, and S&P 500 does grow approximately 10% every year on average). 

So summing up, young investors, you started early and time is on your side. Always be patient and be thoughtful with your decisions!

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",549,stocks

> Lots of posts in this sub asking for advice on how to make money based on riots, and the fact is no one gives a shit and there’s no money to be made on that.

The whole post is filled with top-level comments joking about how everyone on Reddit is stupid for asking and how there's so clearly no money to be made just because people are rioting. To all those looking for opportunity, this is why you should take everything you read on Reddit with a dump truck full of salt.

Clearly the OP of that thread hasn't even been trading long enough, or wasn't active enough in the markets to remember the [almost completely identical situation in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014-2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest) which sent the stocks of three companies flying, among others that made similar but smaller moves. 

[DGLY \(Digital Ally, Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dgly) makes police body cameras and went HAM in August of 2014 as the riots in Ferguson heated up, [rising from under $4.00 to almost $34.00 (yes that's 750%) in less than a month](https://i.imgur.com/QWWBEtq.png)

[ISNS \(Image Sensing Systems Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=isns) makes video and radar processing equipment primarily used in traffic management and traffic data collection. While not a direct riot play, in 2014 it caught momentum from day traders trading DGLY and [rose from $2.50 to $10.00 in six days.](https://i.imgur.com/8vHHf1Z.png). Oh yeah, and it's headquartered in St. Paul, MN, right in the guts of Minneapolis.

[TASR \(TASER International, now trading under the ticker AAXN\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaxn) makes tasers, body cameras and video recording systems for police and has a market cap of nearly $5 billion. It was the leader of the rallies in the ""riot stocks"" in 2014 which triggered all the low float ones like ISNS and DGLY to take off. Between July of 2014 and July of 2015 [it rose from $10.50 to $36.00](https://i.imgur.com/zzZpAuI.png), largely driven by speculation about the effect the riots would have on police regulations.

By the way, DGLY is up 33% today with no news or SEC filings to be found. Coincidence? I don't think so. Traders who were involved in it in 2014 remember its potential just like everyone remembered IBIO and LAKE at the beginning of the coronavirus situation. Where did they remember them from? The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, where both of them did almost the exact same thing they did this time around.

Obviously, these companies aren't investments, and it doesn't matter if it's justified whether they take off like they did in 2014, but if the OP of the top post on this sub right now spent more time looking for opportunity or looking to history to guide them and less time posting uneducated and opinionated garbage on Reddit, maybe they would actually be able to make some money.

I walked away when I was down $5000. I came back a year ago with a new outlook. I recognized I had been making the same mistakes over and over and there were the big lessons I had to learn:

- be skeptical of a company you’ve never heard of; stay away completely until doing lots of research.
- hold good-performing stocks for a long time
- gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.
- read the news (world news, national news, etc.)
- make a plan and stick to it unless you learn information that gives you evidence that your plan is worth changing.
- take advantage of the worst stock market crash ever (LOL)

At present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).

Much of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.

""The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

He added that current valuations were an example of ""stock market failure"" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve ""can't save a stock market.""

""They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,"" Smead said.

A call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.

""In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,"" Smead added.

He suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to ""ride the index to a fault"" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.

""Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.""

Despite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.

Now could be the best time for Amazon (AMZN) to dramatically increase the size of its air fleet.

I was going to be the next Warren Buffett of course ... lol.

In 1999-2001 day trading took the internet by storm.  Even your cab driver had trading tips back then.  I got sucked in with many others, and I also got wiped out.  By early adult hood, I had blown out my account to 0 on dumb options plays, not knowing what I was doing and taking idiotic risk that I didn't fully understand.

For a decade I avoided the market mostly, even though it had once been such a passion.  I got a degree.  Went into a different industry.

Sadly at some point along the way again, I thought I could be a 'trader'.  I went through similar cycles as the first time (perhaps with a bit more knowledge, wisdom and maturity than the first time).  The game is even harder now though.  The HFT's and Algo's are programmed just so perfectly to squeeze out your money, even if it is one penny at a time.  Once again, after wasting many years, I found myself at the bottom.

I will spare you the rest and jump straight to the ending:  I am nearing 36 years old, and my portfolio is nearly non existent.  I am not poor, and I own a nice little business ... but I am also filled with regret.

Had I never started trading, and had I just continued investing, I would probably be a multi millionaire based on the trajectory I was headed by this point.  I also would have gotten to skip many years of shame, doubt and guilt.

The amount of people in this day and age that are actually successful traders are so god damn few and far in between.  There is a reason the entire world has moved to quant systems.  Computers trade better than humans filled with emotions.

Moral of the story for you youngins' out there:  Buy and hold.  Maybe don't buy today at the peak of a fed induced 10+ year bull run and wait for a market correction in the next few years (ironic that I would be giving financial advice by the way), but when the opportunity strikes .... buy and hold.  Make smart investments.   Don't take dumb un-necessary risks.  Sometimes the boring stocks are the absolute best ones.

The stock market shouldn't be exciting.  It shouldn't be something that makes you lose sleep or feel anxiety.  It shouldn't be 'fun'.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/florida-arizona-nevada-hit-daily-highs-for-covid-19-cases-idUSKBN23Y0MR

""Nevada disclosed 1,099 new cases, double its previous high.""

At the height of the pandemic for New York, in the second half of March, they were averaging about 9k cases a day. New York has a population of 19.4M people, meaning roughly 1 new case every day for every 2,160 people in New York in March. Nevada, with 3M people, set a record for themselves of 1 new case for every 2,700 people. And the numbers in Nevada are increasing fast. Nevada could pass New York's worst day in per capita terms in a week.

I just can't see the casinos there remaining open, and even if they do stay open, no one will want to visit from out of state.

**EDIT:** Turns out the overly big jump on June 26 was due to data from lab reports dated 23 and 24 June being included in the 26 June total. However, the brand-new numbers reported for today, June 27th are likely a new record even though weekends are usually lower numbers.

""After a review of the case data, it was determined the increase in reports was due to a delay in laboratory reporting. More than 240 of the cases reported were from laboratory reports dated June 23, and more than 380 were from reports dated June 24.""

155,My Investing Roadmap,Advice,1951,k0t986,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k0t986/my_investing_roadmap/,1606314969.0,"So you want to begin buying stocks?  I’m 33 years old, and begin investing during college (more than 10 years ago).  I’ve learned a ton, and built a substantial portfolio over the 13ish years since I began.  I’ve also done a lot of dumb stuff over the years, and learned a lot of expensive lessons. To me, this is the roadmap to begin investing.  



***Step 1) Be sure you’re financially ready to begin investing.***
In my view, building an investment portfolio is like framing a house.  This is an incredibly important step in your financial security, but needs to be done after you’ve laid the foundation.  I highly recommend Dave Ramsey’s baby steps (I consider my stock account baby step 4).  Read this and watch his youtube.  Bonus points if you can answer callers questions before Dave does on his radio show.  Another great resource is /r/financialindependence .  your stock portfolio should not be money you need in the next 5 years, preferably 20 years.  Put it in there, and don’t take it out.


***Step 2) understand your goals the first year (Year 0-1)***
In the first year of investing you have three main goals.

 
•	**Don’t chicken out.**  Pulling the trigger is the hardest part.  You make your first buy then you open your account 30 times the same day to see how it’s performing.  You’re probably doing this not because you’re afraid of losing money, but you’re afraid of failure or looking stupid.  You might tell yourself, if I learn to do research I can increase my chances of being right. This is dumb.  The most important thing is to start the trip.  Think to yourself, if you need to travel across the country by road and your options are to take the minivan you have now, or wait 3 days until you can get a sports car. Which is a smarter move?  Get your ass in the minivan.

•	**Don’t commit a financial blunder.**  For any of you who play any competitive video game with a ladder you know there is a commonality across all of them.  To climb out of the bottom 50% of any ladder, all you have to do is not commit blunders.  You don’t have to do anything fancy, you don’t have to be flashy, just don’t fuck up.  This is 100% true in the stock market as well.  This means you don’t have to do any financial analysis your first year.  Keep everything as simple as you can to start.  There is still plenty to learn from investing in an ETF the first year, and the third bullet will take enormous amounts of energy.

•	**Learn to manage your emotions.**  The first year is an emotional whirlwind no matter how much you’re investing.  Your primary goal above everything else is to learn to act calmly.  If you check your account value every day, you’re training your brain to inject dopamine every time your account goes up.  This is really, really bad.  You’re going to have a bad day in the market, and your brain doesn’t get the dopamine hit that It’s used to. This leads to panic selling and grief.  If you learn this skill early, I’m 100% convinced your set for life.  The rest is easy.
The other part of this bullet is Reddit is the Instagram of stock market gains.  People only post what they want you to see.  Only the best get upvoted.  This gives us a warped sense of reality, and what our expectations should be in investing.  Don’t get caught in the hype. Don’t YOLO.

***Step 3) what do I do after that? (Year 2-5)***
Holy shit, if you make it here, the fun begins. If you can master your emotions you can then begin to nurture this hobby.  Continue regular contributions to your account. Once it’s in the stock account, don’t think of it as spending money anymore, it’s now investment money.  Find elements of the stock market that interest you and learn more about it.  

If I were to give one thing that you should begin learning now and have down cold it would be “What changes a stock’s price and how does that relate to the value of a company?”

-understand what market capitalization is, an how it relates to a stock price.  What financial tricks can a company play, and how will that affect the stock price, but not the market cap? To me, this is critical to understand.

-be able to know the rough market cap if any major public company you come in contact with on a regular basis. 

-Time value of money.  You don’t need to know the math, just the concept.  How this relates to opportunity cost. 

-understand how earnings and earnings calls actually affect stock price.  You don’t need to actually monitor these, but just understand how earnings and earnings expectations relate.

Once you get that down you’ll find other areas of stocks/ finance that interest you. Do you like to do financial analysis? Learn that.  Do you like to think big picture? Invest your time there.

***Become an investor, not a trader.  Investors are “good business collectors”.***

As you contribute more money into your account, begin picking up individual companies.  Your contributions should be retentively small compared to your overall portfolio.  If it’s not, then contribute more to your ETF.  For the next 5 years, commit to having no more than ½ of your portfolio in individual companies.  This will mitigate risk, and allow you to learn about individual companies and how to look at them.  My suggested method for finding your first few individual companies are “What industries are coming in the 3-5 years, and what companies are the best positioned to be there”.  Only do that for industries you understand (unless you’re a doctor don’t mess with bio-tech).  Some of the meme stocks, are actually great for small individual stock pickups in this stage.  Don’t invest in penny stocks (or anything with a market cap under $2B) until you know what you’re doing.  I’ve lost way more money in shit like this than anything.  Also, don’t fall for value traps (moderate or shitty companies selling for a deep discount).  It might work every once in awhile, but that’s not our game.

At the end of the day, keep this as simple as possible.  If something doesn't feel right, dont do it.  I hope this gives you the push you need to get started, and help someone out there.",290,stocks

158,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech",News,1934,ixyrff,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixyrff/elon_musk_says_tesla_deliveries_will_rise_30_to/,1600817049.0,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.

On Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.

Due partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.

Those who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.

Since its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.

Tesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.

Remaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.

The stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. 

Expecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:

“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”

Cannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.

Shares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.

159,A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy. (My Renewable portfolio with DD),,1927,ice312,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ice312/a_guide_for_those_looking_to_invest_in_renewable/,1597799799.0,"I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. 

---------------------------

I'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. 

------------------------------

Tesla (TSLA)     (511% gain) 

Most of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder 

My bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.

--------------------------------------

Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)         (91.4% gain)

https://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf

Vestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. 

--------------------------------

First Solar (FSLR).    (24% gain)

First Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. 

My bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign companies. 

----------------------------------

Jinko Solar (JKS)         (22% gain)

https://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119

Jinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. 

--------------------------

Canadian Solar (CSIQ)           (27.5% gain)

http://investors.canadiansolar.com/events

Canadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing & project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. 
They trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. 

My bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. 

--------------------------

SolarEdge (SEDG)           (126% gain)

https://investors.solaredge.com/

SolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. 

My bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage & EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. 

--------------------------

TPI composites (TPIC).            (70.55% gain)
  
https://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf

TPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex & Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.

-------------------

Enphase Energy (ENPH)        (46% gain)

https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9

Enphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. 

My bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). 

-----------------------

Brookfield Renewables (BEPC).          (12% gain)

Brookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. 

My bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide me with exposure to hydroelectric energy.

164,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,Discussion,1861,g3odl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3odl6/options_trading_basics_for_beginners/,1587220163.0,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

165,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.",,1830,hiwzgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hiwzgo/15_years_since_my_journey_began_52_591_dollars/,1593553376.0,"*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

*Portfolio distribution*

* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*
* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*
* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)
* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER
* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

*The Missing piece*

What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you.

172,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,News,1793,k3okkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/,1606709769.0,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

176,"You asked me to look into the renewable energy sector, so here it is.",,1788,g0o33t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g0o33t/you_asked_me_to_look_into_the_renewable_energy/,1586800793.0,"After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I’m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. 

When you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there’s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don’t hit the right one, it’s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won’t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. 

Secondly, you all know Trump doesn’t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can’t really go bad with investing in it. 

Last argument, I feel like a lot of people don’t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It’s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,… to keep their cloud servers running for example. 

— — — — — — — — — —

In this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  

**ENPH**  
Market leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It’s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they’re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They’re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn’t even launch their best technology yet. 

**SEDG**  
Great financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that’s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG ‘yesterday’s solution’. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. 

**FSLR**  
Very inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it’s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it’s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. 

**JKS**  
Very innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or ‘moat’ by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.

**CSIQ**  
Looking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn’t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria’s patented module technology. 

**NOVA**  
They might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. 

**AZRE**  
They have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they’ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That’s also the main reason why the stock didn’t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. 

— — — — — — — — — —

Next, I’m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I’m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don’t believe in them.

**VWDRY**  
The wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn’t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can’t really go wrong with them.

**REGI**  
REGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it’s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.

As you can see, I didn’t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn’t bad. However it’s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it’s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It’s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can’t compete with other resources. 

— — — — — — — — — —

For me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.

To conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.

There are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don’t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I’ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I’m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I’ve gathered over the past few months.",313,stocks

Hey all!

Due to the coronavirus, a ton of executives are participating in unusual compensation/purchasing activity. So I have begun scraping the SEC website to see which executives are purchasing, selling, or being awarded stock for no known reason except that the stock price is extra low and they may just be buying their stock at a discount (or selling it before it crashes further).

Obviously, we don't know how long the coronavirus may keep the market down, but this can help us see which executives believe their stock will rebound nicely and which believe it will continue to decline.

While only 3 executives made purchases and the amounts purchased aren’t massive, they were made by their 3 highest-ranking executives who almost never make open market purchases.

180,NVidia – Know What You Own,,1760,gln51p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gln51p/nvidia_know_what_you_own/,1589748775.0,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",324,stocks

Airbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.

It’s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.

Between early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.

Filings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.

All four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.

Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.

Despite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.

The sector’s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

On top of stepping back from advising companies that get most of their revenue from coal extraction, JPMorgan said it will put restrictions on financing new coal-fired power plants, phase out “credit exposure” to the industry by 2024 and will stop funding new oil and gas drilling projects in the Arctic.",149,stocks

A decade ago, no major automaker was going to bet on a non-existent electric-vehicle market. Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.

Make no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, ""Who killed the electric car?"" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).

Now, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

This sub is great to look at DD’s at stocks and to get good stock news. However, it is incredibly ridiculous the amount of posts and comments here asking what x stock is going to do or how the stock market is going to perform next month. I would've thought it would be just the people who are new to the stock market or this subreddit, but there are actually a large number of people here that have been posting/commenting on the subreddit for a while, meaning they aren't new here and they STILL do this. 

However, this isn't even the main problem. The actual problem is the people who reply to these posts/comments and they act like they know what they are talking about so they will say some BS with 100% confidence which probably will influence many of the people who don't know any better. The more you think about it, the more concerning it actually becomes. I don't believe ignorance warrants someone to getting screwed over so just because someone is dumb enough to trust a random redditor and lose money doesn't mean they deserve it. This is very serious stuff since this is literally people's money and I wish more people realized how awful it is that people will come here and look at any advice and dump their money into a random stock and then come back later with major losses.

**I think this even applies to most people on this subreddit but at a more subliminal level**. I have a feeling that there are many people here that still are prone to this, even if they don't blatantly listen to random people. For example, pretty much everyone in this subreddit agreed to not buy anything during March because ""the bottom hasn't come yet"". I have even seen posts asking if the stimulus package would help the stock market and people pretty much agreed that it wasn't going to do much (you can look at the threads if you want). People would reply to these posts with absolute confidence; not a ""probably not"" or ""I don't think so"", but a ""It's not going to do x"". When these posts/comments are constantly upvoted and replicated, this can even influence the people who disagreed, creating a conformity effect based on majority social influence and not factual information. 

I guarantee you there are people here who were interested in buying in March when stocks were at a very low price, looked at this subreddits opinions, and ended up not buying them because the majority of people said not to. When in reality, that would've been the ideal thing to do, and they could've made a lot of money. I don't know how these types of posts and comments are so popular on this subreddit, but they are.

210,Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth.,,1591,j1e5th,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j1e5th/musk_sets_sights_on_selling_20_million_teslas_by/,1601307077.0,"Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.

The numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.

A few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”

The 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.

But Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.

Toyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.

None of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.""

At the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.

Obviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.

Musk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.

It is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.

If Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

There is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Gains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.

This is totally misinformation, that has been unfortunately spread by NBC.

What actually happened is that interviewer Savannah Guthrie, gave a long supposition, and asked Calhoun to agree with it:

>GUTHRIE: The money that the government used to bailout the airlines runs out in September, so they are going to have to start laying off people. Do you expect that the airlines to be able to survive this?   Do you think there might be a major U.S. carrier that just has to go out of business?  
>  
>CALHOUN: **Well, I don't want to get too predictive on that subject**, but yes, most likely. You know, something will have to happen when September comes around... 

She put words into his mouth, and asked two different questions at the same time-- the first being an obvious yes, the second should have been a ""no."" He may have already been primed to answer, as indicated by his stumbling response, then merely blurted out, ""but yes, most likely."" 

Before the full interview was released, [NBC News PR edited the segment in a post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NBCNewsPR/status/1259970858447253505) -- making Calhoun reply, ""Yes, most, likely"" only to the last part, and leaving out the rest of what he said!  

It's a case of unethical editing -- which was then propagated by other sources.

[*USA Today* picked it up](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/05/11/boeing-ceo-predicts-major-airline-go-out-business-coronavirus-pandemic/3113292001/?mod=article_inline), sourcing the NBC News PR Twitter edited version.

Based on the *USA Today* story, [Marketwatch repeated the claim](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-major-us-airline-most-likely-will-go-bankrupt-boeing-ceo-says-in-interview-2020-05-12)

Reuters, usually a trustworthy source, [further spread the misquote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-boeing-airlines/boeing-ceo-sees-passenger-levels-under-25-in-september-pain-for-airlines-nbc-interview-idUSKBN22N31M) which ended up getting reprinted in multiple places.

A writer at *Forbes* then amped the claim, saying Calhoun ""[responded quickly and strongly, “Yes, most likely.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willhorton1/2020/05/12/boeing-ceo-expects-airline-bankruptcy--what-did-he-really-mean-about-coronavirus-impacts/#6c79022d344a)

Boeing had to put out a statement about Calhoun's quote, via spokesman Gordon Johndroe: “He was speaking to the general uncertainty in the sector, not about any one particular airline.” But it was too late -- the damage was already being done to all the industry components.

What was Calhoun thinking, showing up on the TODAY show for an interview, as a new CEO? There was no benefit to his company.

There is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there’s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays—the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.

All of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is “Hi, Speed.”) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.

Ives says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks “could be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.”

Ives is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China—he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.

“With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook & Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,” he writes. “Although the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.”

Ives maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will “kick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.”

Muller is also bullish about Apple’s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. “We view Apple’s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,” he writes. “In addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.”

Assuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. “Our revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,” he writes.  “In total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.”

During the press conference Trump said it was being provided by google with a team of over a thousand engineers getting it working.

Google/Alphabet now is denying all of this with a clarification after the press conference.  Alphabet's subsidiary Verily is just working on screening in a pilot in San Francisco and didn't know at all what the press conference was talking about:

>We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.

Leave aside the Google/Alphabet distinction that they mention one time in the article (which is nitpicky for clickbait), and look at this:

>Carolyn Wang, communications lead for Verily, told The Verge that the “triage website” was initially only going to be made available to health care workers instead of the general public. Now that it has been announced the way it was, however, anybody will be able to visit it, she said. But the tool will only be able to direct people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, though Wang says Verily hopes to expand it beyond California “over time.”

That's the website they promoted during the press conference, and ""now that it has been announced the way it was"" indicates they didn't coordinate with them on the announcement at all.

Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

She bought 300 of the company’s shares in the fall of 2010, a few months after its IPO, and picked up more stock over time.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” > “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock.
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

231,IMPORTANT: proposed SEC filing that will affect you,,1496,hs19jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hs19jm/important_proposed_sec_filing_that_will_affect_you/,1594865690.0,"Repost from /u/Particular-Wedding 

If you use 13F filing data in your investing research then please take a few minutes to read this important message.
You may have already seen the SEC proposal https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml?__s=cvwgmhfkxsnsnrbvs6py to dramatically raise the required reporting threshold for 13F filings.  

This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion!  

To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers.  $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight.  When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of [the US] securities markets.”  Taking this data away will have the opposite effect.  Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets.

One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to this proposal.  https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10
The proposed rule change would be a loss for all of us - it would enable more corruption and opaqueness.

The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. This can only hurt small trades/investors and provides little to no benefit or savings.

Comments are already pouring into the SEC.  I am urging everyone to please post a comment on the proposal to the SEC site linked below.  Why should we care?  How are we impacted by this?  Below are some issues to raise.  Please mention them in your comments to the SEC and to your representative in Congress:
Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.
​
 

-	The “justification” for the rule change is highly questionable.
-	When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor
-	Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.
-	In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The S&P suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

EDIT: There is an overwhelming amount of ""advice"" about investing in this company, which is fine, but the point of this thread is to gather user experience to determine what the sentiment is of boots on the ground. Part of my due diligence about this company is finding out how the users like it, not hearing the same regurgitated $1000 in 1 year garbage, or ""it's a sure thing"".

I would urge anyone with experience using it to be critical, as I think the comments going against everyones confirmation bias are likely the most important.

EDIT EDIT: It's really unfortunate that people are downvoting critical comments of the software, as those are exactly the types of comments this thread is meant to be embracing. Before you downvote, try and wrap your head around the context of the thread. I would also say, that downvoting things that oppose your confirmation bias is VERY revealing about the state of this sub and others - anyone should see that as alarming.

It's hard to reconcile the overwhelming positivity in this thread with the echoed sentiment on those comments. Something just doesn't add up to me. It tells me that more people entering this thread are of the opinion that the software isn't all it is cracked up to be, but the comments here don't match.

A user (u/eqpofr) had asked in a comment sure to get buried:

""Can commenters state in what context they used the software, and what their main tasks were, in addition to whether they liked the software or not? Context matters a lot and it's lacking in the discourse I'm seeing here""

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

> He may not be as slick as the other billionaire electric truck impresarios Elon Musk or Nikola’s disgraced former CEO Trevor Milton, but Healy has one up on both Tesla and Nikola when it comes to getting revolutionary tech onto the road. There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion’s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.

Also:

> Healy’s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy’s approach contrasts with the field’s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.

And:

> Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana’s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon.

The year 2021 “is shaping up to be a critical year for EV adoption and (internal combustion engine) de-adoption that will dictate the pace of multiple expansion, contraction, consolidation and proliferation” among the stocks, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in the note.

Despite the momentary dips amid stock offerings, EV stocks are enjoying a 2020 stock surge that is more widespread than Nio’s jaw-dropping 2020 gains. Tesla is up 625% this year, while XPeng is up more than 111% and Li Auto around 100%.

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

I know these are not likely worth anything, but I’m genuinely curious. From what I can tell in my quick internet searching, the company no longer exists in the same structure of the time of the share purchase (acquisition possibly). 

I’ve found a couple sites that you can pay ~$50 for experts to do some deep research and track down their current worth. Anyone have experience doing their own research on older paper stocks or recommendations for a good service?

***Edit 1 to add company info. 

The company is Plough Inc, which looks to have eventually merged under Merck. I’ve reached out to Merck’s Transfer Agent (based on rec’s from google). Will update here as I make progress.

***Edit 2 
I appreciate all the interest! No definite answers yet, but hoping to hear back from a Merck rep in the next few days. 

As of now, here are my thoughts from my digging and combined effort of the powers of reddit: 
- My certificate states exactly 2 shares purchased in 1948 for Plough Inc. between all of the mergers and share splits, I could be up to 5 shares of current Merck value (~$83/share)
- Theres a high possibility I will run into a barrier with the certificate being in my great-grandfathers name. This will likely cause major issues on trying to claim dividends lost to unclaimed property. I also have no clue how long dividends were collected originally. Curious to see if the name piece is an issue in redeeming current stock value. 

This won’t be a huge windfall either way - a few hundred $$ at the most unless I’m missing some major splits early on.",615,stocks

I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed and lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.

I was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. 

So I changed the way I invest.

I stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if the apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.

I buy and DCA (Dollar cost average) everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF

This is my current portfolio

AMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.

If you think ""ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit""

Yes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.

Sometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. 

The main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. 

So I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it

My portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months

All due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. 

When I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.

I don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.

But before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?

Conclusion: This relationship that was observed was an anomaly of one of the largest corporations on the market having very large returns in the past 15 years, notable MSFT. 

But when you account for the fact that tech stocks that have been high lately pay very low dividends, and the rest of the S&P pay higher dividends, you find the returns are comparable, yet what is significant is that the risk adjusted returns are not close to comparable. You are far more likely to buy losers and be exposed to portfolio risk by putting significant wealth into single companies. You might buy GE or XOM and never grab the next MSFT. The index fund gives you nearly the same return, and does it without the risk.


Edit: I re-ran the calculations using inflation adjusted investment values ($1000 in 1996 and increasing by CPI for each year thereafter). Used https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913- for CPI data.

The S&P500 seems to pull farther ahead when you account for inflation. I don't know if this is significant or just related to this one particular example.

Edit2: I redid the analysis using rebalancing. The formula sells its entire portfolio at the start of each year and distributes the funds across the top N companies by market cap at that point. (I used inflation adjusted investment additions)

Here is the first graph: https://i.imgur.com/CkvYu1h.png

You can see that all top N portfolios beat the S&P 500, some by a lot. If you were to have implemented this in your IRA you'd see these results.

This next graph pretends that you held each asset for exactly 1 year and paid long term capital gains tax on the gains of 15%.

Here is the graph: https://i.imgur.com/75whnQK.png

And lastly here is the graph that assumes you are paying short term capital gains taxes, and those are roughly 24%.

Here is the graph: https://i.imgur.com/rCoSref.png

Note: For all of these portfolios, losses *are* carried forward to offset future taxes.

The impact of the coronavirus-induced economic shutdown tore through the U.S. labor market in April at historic levels, slashing 20.5 million workers from nonfarm payrolls and sending the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Both numbers easily smashed post-World War II era records and help reflect the profound damage done through efforts used to combat the virus.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting payrolls to shed 21.5 million and the unemployment rate to go to 16%. April’s unemployment rate topped the post-war record 10.8% but was short of the Great Depression high estimated at 24.9%. The financial crisis peak was 10% in October 2009.

&#x200B;

The news initially came with a pop upwards in the future for the S&P500. Currently, it's pointing to an opening of close to 1% up. Broader U6 unemployment rate leaps to record 22.8% from 8.7% as well. March unemployment was also revised from 701,000 jobs lost to 870,000 jobs lost.

Full disclosure, I do own PLTR along with EV stocks outside of TSLA.  They currently only make up less than 10% of my portfolio.

The rally that we have seen this week has been impressive.  I imagine for traders this was an incredible week and a lot of money was made.  Hats off to you guys and cheers.  I've learned that there are many ways to win on the market, and trading is certainly one of them.  I'm not one to say that it's a horrible way to approach the markets just because it doesn't work or sit well with me.  That said, for those who are interested in TRADING, this post may not apply as much to you.

However, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions

1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?
2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals?
3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?
4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?

At least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.

At the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  If your decision to invest is completely based on speculation, then acknowledge that and make sure even that is part of your plan.  I generally encourage every investor to leave some room for spec. plays, but only to the extent that every dollar you invest is all accounted for.  Remember the fundamental fact that by buying a company's stocks you are buying into that company.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.

Through a simple strategy of picking blue-chip stocks, indexed ETFs, portfolio diversification, (and staying off Wall Street Bets), I am up 15% in one year, netting about $11,000 in profits when I would have gotten a fraction of that. Part of it was fortunate timing no doubt. 

My big winners have been NVDA 83% up, AMZN 79%, CMG 74% and BABA 63% and the low-cost ETFs I use to further diversify are QQQ, VOT, MGK, VGLT, VTWO and VWO. I learned hard lessons on BA 56%, PCG46% and INTC 27%. 

The biggest advice is would give to new investors is don't get greedy by chasing huge overnight gains with YOLO bets using options and leverage. Find well-run companies that you can hold long-term, make sure you don't overweight into certain sectors (I am guilty of this with amount of tech I hold), and you should be able to earn yourself steady returns. If you're afraid of jumping in because you think the market is at an all-time high, buy-in using DCA.

Today, I am posting about Palantir. Might be a little late posting about this, I bought in around $10 which is their IPO price. Here's a couple reasons why I believe in the long term success of this company.

* Big name backers like Peter Theil.
* Big data/AI analysis. I don't own any stocks in this industry aside from your typical FAANG stocks. This is an opportunity to consolidate my positions into a more focused strategy. I also get to invest in government and defense stocks at the same time.
* Palantir is not just a government and defense stock. Palantir is already expanding to enterprise applications. I believe that this is where our future in society is moving towards. We have made significant progress in technology in the past 20-50 years. We spent so much time and money developing and rushing out newer technologies and in the mad rush we forgot to optimize. There is so much room to use AI and machine learning to figure out where the inefficiencies lies.
* This kind of proprietary tech has a huge moat. It's not something that any competitor can just come and replicate. Their technology is advanced enough to attract attention from the government and companies like General Motors. Having also worked in the industry, I can tell that their tech is way more advanced than their competitors.

As always, only invest what you can lose and you are ultimately responsible for managing your own risk!

EDIT: This post surprisingly caught wind. I'm glad that some of you share the same views about PLTR as I do, I am also glad some of you are expressing skepticism. I love discussing companies and general stocks.

With that in mind, please remember to do your own DD and don't blindly follow strangers! If you're new, please start small and take the time to learn.

I also got questions and DMs asking me to evaluate certain stocks/industries. If it's anything other than what I've posted or am holding, it is likely that i unfortunately would not be able to give you a proper DD on it and can only respond on my gut feelings.

1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.
2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.
3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.
4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.
5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.
6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an ""everything is great, pile into the markets"" sentiment.
7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.
8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.

In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that’s why they took out new shorts on GME.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they’ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there’s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let’s move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I’ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I’ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I’m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple’s stock price rises and Gamestop’s (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn’t go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let’s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what’s known as an arbitrage trade. ***It's also a cluster of nuclear bombs that may go off for shorters***, but if it does, it'll make someone rich. I’ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It’s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scarce, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I’ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I’ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult means to buy back all the shares before the market discovers that these shares are valuable/high demand and Hedge funds will likely have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting data is a opaque dark art and it’s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn’t block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I’ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but an estimate short interest and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

**AMC**

[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)

Estimate Short Interest: 63M

Float: 102M

% of float shorted 62%

**Dillards (DDS)**

[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)

Estimate Short Interest: 4.2M

Float: 5.5M

% of float shorted: 76%

**Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)**

[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)

Estimate Short Interest: 58M

Float: 109M

% of float shorted: 54%

**MAC**

[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)

Estimate Short Interest: 71M

Float: 113M

% of float shorted: 63%

**SKT**

[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)

Estimate Short Interest: 48M

Float: 90M

% of float shorted: 53%

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze similar to what has happened with GME and AMC this week.

***It's why brokerages are likely preventing people from buying them or limiting the number of shares to buy.  They may have data that these shares have high short interest and are vulnerable to a short squeeze, so they may be actively limiting people from buying them to ensure a short squeeze doesn't happen.***  That is not a free market! They may be protecting hedge fund interest over your own ability to do what you want with your money.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren’t valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing a sudden drop in price, and signal people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares they need to acquire with this attack? Instead of buying all at once, they use short ladder attack with a short position to gain shares from people scared of a sudden price drop.

It’d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you’ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more shares to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

***If you believe in the infinite short squeeze thesis, you'll have to HOLD through this short ladder attack.  It'll be painful and you may panic.  But if you believe in the thesis, hold.  You'll only lose what you put, if the thesis is wrong, but if the thesis is correct, it may change your life.*** 

**Note:**   Strong short squeezes are usually seen when short interest is above 50%.  Anything lower and the hedge fund can't usually be squeezed unless they make a strategic misstep, which rarely happens.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you’re willing to lose. Diamond hands.

**TLDR;**

**Should hedge funds be force to liquidate their holdings because of a GME short squeeze, they will rush to cover their other high short position, because if they don't, they will lose control of the share price. But before they try to buy up the shares they owe, if millions of people have bought in before they are able to buy up all the shares, it may set up a short squeeze like with GME and AMC this week where those share prices went up 300%-600%.**

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. SOMPO’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPO’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir.",256,stocks

What money can't buy is TIME, make sure you are happy during your time as you will get older and value less what money you have and value more what TIME you have left. Don't chase the lambo, chase the feeling of happiness. A lambo may not make you happy if you lost all your life chasing it. Don't get addicted to risky trades as they will bite you in the ass (if only that) if you don't play safe.

What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let’s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

295,Chipotle to open its first digital-only restaurant as online orders soar,News,1237,jsesa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jsesa9/chipotle_to_open_its_first_digitalonly_restaurant/,1605122783.0,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Saturday will open first digital-only restaurant.

Unlike a traditional Chipotle location, it will not include a dining room or a line for ordering. Customers have to order in advance on Chipotle's app, website or third-party delivery platforms.

The new restaurant design is meant for urban areas, where real estate is more expensive and a full-size restaurant isn't possible, but the first location will open in Highland Falls, New York, just outside of the gates of West Point.

The design will also be able to accommodate large catering orders, which will have their own entry and lobby for pick-up.

The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated customers' shift to ordering online, pushing Chipotle to try to optimize the experience as much as possible. In the third quarter, the company reported that digital sales more than tripled. CEO Brian Niccol said total digital orders could exceed $2.5 billion this year, more than double last year's total.

The crisis and its shock to the restaurant industry has also pushed other companies to rethink their designs. Burger King and Shake Shack are among the restaurants that plan to add drive-thru lanes reserved for delivery drivers or online orders. Starbucks is now planning to build more mobile pickup cafes this year and in 2021 than it previously thought. 

Shares of Chipotle, which has a market value of $34.8 billion, have risen 67% this year. The stock rose 4% in morning trading.

Nobody wants to sell their position only to see it rip the next few days or weeks and likewise nobody wants to hold their position only to see it dump.

So why not sell half? When you're unsure whether it's a good time to exit a position, just sell half, this way you keep some skin in the game if it does rip and if it tanks then at least you bagged profit to the value of 50% of your position.

I assure you from an emotional point of view it feels much better being ""half"" right 100% of the time than being completely right 50% of the time. Set yourself targets to gradually exit out of your position.

306,Warren Buffett is MORE LIKELY to purchase an individual airline than sell all his airline positions.,Ticker Discussion,1211,fvgvmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fvgvmi/warren_buffett_is_more_likely_to_purchase_an/,1586105389.0,"Update: Looks like Buffet went with option 3, selling all his shares (though he did disclose his exiting of the positions). He’s clearly of the belief that our world post-COVID will not be friendly to airlines and is cutting his losses here.

...

Here's some insight into Warren Buffett's selloff of Delta Airlines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV). The backing away from airline stocks marks something of a reversal for Warren Buffett. The investor bought more Delta stock several weeks ago. Buffett told Yahoo Finance less than a month ago that ""I won't be selling airline stocks."" Why did Buffett sell so many shares of DAL and LUV yesterday? Thoughts below:

1. Warren Buffett reduced his ownership of DAL and LUV to under 10%, so he does not need to report every trade he makes. Prior to this sale, Buffett owned over 10% of DAL and LUV. Because of his significant ownership in the companies, he needs to report every move he makes to the SEC. With his ownership reduced to <10%, Buffett can buy and sell DAL and LUV without needing to report it until the end of the quarter. Now his airline stakes are all <10%. 

2. Buffett is NOT selling DAL for cash to invest elsewhere. Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on $128B in cash. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy any stock he likes. Therefore, his move to sell DAL and LUV is NOT to free up money to purchase other stocks. 

3. Buffett may be about to make a dramatic move as airlines have ~3 months without government aid until it runs out of cash. We will use DAL as a representation of the airline industry. Accounting for cash and cash equivalents and credit withdrawal only, DAL only has 3 months of cash left given its CEO reported the company is burning through $60M per day. Of course, this is not accounting for government support, other current assets, and cost cutting (e.g., furloughing employees). With these measures, DAL may have a few months above water. Given the situation that DAL is in, Buffett is likely about to make a dramatic move - either sell off his remaining airline positions or purchase 100% shares of an airline company.

Here are three things Buffett may be doing in order of likelihood:

1. High Likelihood: Buffett is simply trimming his positions so they are under 10% stake. Buffett has mentioned several times that he likes to own less than 10% stake for reporting reasons, specifically in regards to airline stocks. He may have just trimmed his stake to <10% and plan on holding there.

2. Moderate Likelihood: Buffett is reducing stakes in DAL and LUV as it plans to acquire and competitor airline. Prior to Buffett's acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway, he scaled down his position in Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) railways about a year before his purchase of BNSF. If Buffett is thinking about purchasing an airline, which he has contemplated in the past, he may be targeting American Airlines, which he currently owns the largest stake in (10%). Keep in mind that before he extended a tender offer to BNSF, he owned 17% of the company. Finally, Buffett already owns NetJets, the world's largest private jet company.

3. Low Likelihood: Buffett reduced his shares to <10% so he does not need to report his complete exit from airlines. There is speculation that Buffett is reducing his stake to under 10% so he can exit airlines completely without needing to report his trades. We believe this is unlikely because Buffett's mantra is ""be greedy when others are fearful"". Airlines are not going anywhere as the U.S. is one of the most globalized nations. The only reason why Buffett may be selling is if he fears the government stake in airlines will be at a significantly reduced price. With this said, he may as well just buy the airline at that point to not sell at a complete loss.",223,stocks

What makes me even more suspicious is the amount of awards they got, we know how rare they are here, but every Nokia post here got them and even got mostly the same.

It is really scarry, I think hedges realised the amount of money floating around these subs and now want to take it from us or just benefit from it. Look at the Nokia Chart, went parabolic last friday with high volume. The accounts of the posters also look super suspicious.

Maybe this is testing the water for them and the worst is yet to come, but this is a good reminder to never trust someone blindly. I hope mods can do something about it.

Examples, it surged to 118% before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 a, and topped 100% before the 2008 financial crisis.

It now sits at 179%, question is, can we rely on this measure? Looking forward to hearing from the community.

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest -- or even count -- dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0. Factoring in dividends (especially if you are reinvesting at market price on the day of issuance) and their potential tax implications for each of the 75 lots would make the analysis significantly more complex.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling beyond the initial annual purchase with new capital. There is NO REALIGNMENT (which would involve cap gains, etc.). This is pure dollar cost averaging. Another analysis worth doing might consider cashing out companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far in a non-taxable account like a Roth. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline might lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

Here are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, the ratio of underperformers number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon Mobil (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) to date lost to the equivalent SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

*****
> The stock market enters a four-day week that is the lull before earnings season, but it’s the headlines on developments around the spread of the coronavirus that may result in the most volatility.
*****
> Strategists say investors are now most focused on how the virus is progressing, what medical developments might help, and how long it could take to end the shutdown of most of the U.S. 
*****
> “I think it’s a wait and see with a drift to the downside. I think if you look back to that three-, four-day rally we had in March, capping off the end of the month, I think a lot of that was reaction to the Fed, a lot of it was reaction to the stimulus out of Washington,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “There were good vibes coming off of that, but that was yesterday’s news. I think the Fed has done a good job. They have peoples’ confidence...One thing we now need is a decline in the number of virus cases in the U.S.”
*****
> Oil could be a factor in the week ahead as OPEC and Russia hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss production cuts. Oil rallied 12% in the past week with West Texas Intermediate futures at $28.34 per barrel, its best week ever.  President Donald Trump sparked the rally when he said he spoke to Saudi Arabia and Russia and they wanted a deal to cut production. 
*****
> In the past week, stocks were lower for the third week in four, as the market absorbed the latest shocking reports of layoffs, and investors worried about the duration of the virus related shutdowns. The S&P 500 closed down 2% for the week, at 2,488.
*****
> # Jobs picture
> On Sunday, Trump extended the guidelines on social distancing to April 30, as the number of cases grew.
*****
> Thursday’s report of 6.6 million new unemployment claims for the week ended March 28 brought the two week total of workers filing claims to 10 million. The biggest data report in the week ahead could again be that jobless claims number on Thursday.  
*****
> “We look for 7 million new claims to be reported for the week ended April 4, though obviously the range of uncertainty around this forecast is wide, and a substantial decline is also possible,” noted J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
*****
> Consumer sentiment is reported Thursday, and consumer price index inflation is reported Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday.
*****
> “I’m not a big believer that investors gain a lot of information from single points of data and even less right now,” said Mike Swell, co-head of global portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We need the world to open back up. We need the global economies to open back up to have any sense of the lasting impact of this on jobs. The concerns in corporate boardrooms is how conservative they’re going to be when it comes to cap ex and hiring.”
*****
> The Fed releases minutes of its last meeting Wednesday.
*****
> “The schedule doesn’t matter anymore. What matters now is how the pandemic is playing out, the extent of the downturn of the economy, and then how capital markets are functioning,” Swell said. “All of those things together are going to drive what the Fed’s going to do, and they’ll act when they need to take action.”
*****
> The Fed has flooded the markets with liquidity and is ballooning its balance sheet with Treasury and mortgage purchases. Swell said the Fed’s programs are helping the markets they’ve taken aim at including corporate debt, mortgages and commercial paper.

> # Earnings ahead
> First quarter earnings season is scheduled to start in the week after next, and there could be more companies withdrawing guidance between now and then.

> “We’re all facing the realization [the virus shutdown] that it’s going to take longer, it’s going to go deeper and that alone is taking the wind out of the sales,” said Calvasina. “Then the companies are going to report , and they’re not going to tell us anything...companies are just withdrawing guidance. It’s not even like there’s a new lower bar. Are we going to come out of this with a bar or are we going to come out of this with no direction?”
*****
> According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline about 5.5% for the first quarter, which saw the biggest impact from the virus in the final weeks of March. 
*****
> Calvasina said she expects the market to retest the lows of March 23, in part because it does not seem investors have gotten negative enough. She said they do not appear to be factoring in the latest gloomy projections from economists of a more than 30% decline in second quarter GDP. She said the market could still have a ways to go before bottoming, and notes the financial crisis drop was 49%. A drop of that magnitude would take the S&P to 1,727.
*****
> Her own survey of clients shows that many investors still have a bullish view on the market with a six to 12-month horizon. “We’re seeing investors taking a constructive view. They like what the Fed has done.There seems to be a view about the economy that the damage is really going to be concentrated in the second quarter, and it’s going to be contained in terms of depth and contained in terms of duration,” she said.

# A Technical Look at Market Internals

> Following last week’s more than 10% gain, the S&P 500 Index is tracking toward another weekly loss, its fifth of the last seven. This has many investors wondering if a retest of the lows may be in the cards for US equities. As we explored in our How Markets Bottom post, two of the bear markets we believe show the most similarities to our current one did retest or undercut the lows after the worst of the selling.

> “Whether or not we get a retest is an open question,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But we believe we’ve seen the worst of the selling, and we will be watching to confirm that fewer individual stocks are making new lows on a further pullback in the indexes.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-picture-4.3.20.png?ssl=1))**

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, although the S&P 500 made its low on March 23, more stocks actually bottomed a week earlier on March 16, when more than two-thirds of the individual stocks in the index hit a one-year low. Regardless of the direction of the S&P 500 over the coming days, we want to see this trend of fewer stocks making new lows continue.

# Road to Recovery Playbook Factor #1: COVID-19 Case Update

> Factor #1 in our Road to Recovery Playbook is finding confidence in the peak of COVID-19 cases in the United States. At LPL Research we are monitoring this factor daily, and we wanted to provide an update into what we are seeing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, while the number of new cases in the United States has continued to climb, the number of new cases seen outside of the US has begun to drop in recent days. In fact, Italy, the worst-hit country in terms of total deaths from the virus, reported on Tuesday that new cases hit a two-week low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/picture-blog-cases-pandemic.png?ssl=1))**

> This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

> The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

> “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States. Investors have historically been rewarded for investing during these crisis events, and we believe the time for suitable investors to consider adding some risk to their portfolios may be approaching.”

# Can April’s Top-Month Record Extend Market Rally?

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for the seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. The unprecedented speed of the current market selloff and current bear market would appear to have made this year’s signal insignificant. This could be the case, but it is far too early to say if the worst of the bear market is over. Double-digit DJIA losses during the “Best Six Months” have only occurred three times (ending in April in 1970, 1974 and 2009) since 1950. In 1970 & 2009 the “Worst Six Months” were positive while in 1974 DJIA slide another 20.5%.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fourteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. This year, guidance will likely be the greatest focus, as first and second quarter earnings are likely to be disappointing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

> Historically bullish election-year influences (the second-best year of the four-year presidential election cycle) have the exact opposite effect on April. Average gains since 1952 are approximately half of the average gain of all years since 1950 for DJIA and S&P 500. Largely due to a 15.6% loss in 2000, NASDAQ’s typical strength in all Aprils since 1971 is transformed into an average loss in election years.

> This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

# Down Best Six Months Not Encouraging

> The depth of this waterfall decline may be too deep for the market to rebound quickly. This bear market also put this year’s Best Six Months (November-April) at risk of being negative. The record of down Best Six Months is not encouraging and it reminds us of a salient quote from the Almanac from an old market sage, “If the market does not rally, as it should during bullish seasonal periods, it is a sign that other forces are stronger and that when the seasonal period ends those forces will really have their say.”— Edson Gould (Stock market analyst, Findings & Forecasts, 1902-1987)

> The table below of Down Best Six Month for DJIA since 1950 also suggests caution and patience is in order. Subsequent Worst Six Months (May-October) have averaged losses with only two decent years 1982 and 2009. The market bottom in August 1982 marked the end of the 1966-1982 secular bear market and came of the early 1980s double dip recession. Following the first back-to-back down Best Six Months since 1973-1974, the market hit a secular bear market low in March 2009. Market action in the rest of these years was rather grim.

# Sector Relative Strength

> Over the past year, the Technology sector has been the most notable sector in terms of outperformance relative to the S&P 500. As shown in the charts from our Sector Snapshot below, the relative strength chart for Technology has been in a steady uptrend for the past twelve months without much interruption even while the decade long bull market was coming to an end. In fact, last week it was the first sector to exit oversold territory after every sector was oversold for 13 days. The other sectors have not been as lucky. During the recent sell off, the relative performance of most sectors, especially cyclicals like Energy, Financials, and Industrials, fell sharply (indicating even worse declines than the S&P 500). Consumer Staples and Health Care, on the other hand, have seen much stronger performance than the rest of the market.

# Consumers Turn Bearish on Equities

> Tuesday's Consumer Confidence report managed to exceed expectations, but as we noted at the time, the survey for the March reports cuts off on the 18th, so as economic conditions turned south, sentiment levels also likely declined. One area of the report where sentiment already has seen a notable decline is in consumer sentiment towards stock prices. As shown in the top chart below, the percentage of consumers expecting stock prices to decline nearly doubled from 21.7% up to 39.2% while the percentage of consumers looking for higher prices dropped from 43.1% down to 32.3%. In the case of negative sentiment, the percentage of bearish consumers hasn't been this high since late 2012.

> Given the major shift in sentiment, the spread between bullish and bearish consumers has seen a major reversal falling from firmly positive (21.4) to firmly negative (-6.9). By this measure, the spread between bullish and bearish investors hasn't been this negative since February 2016.

# The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly Commodities in Q1

> Very few assets have been winners recently, especially in the commodities space. As shown in the table below, no major energy or metal commodities (front-month futures) rose in March and gold was the only one to rise in the first quarter. The degree of those declines varied greatly. While gasoline and WTI futures (crude oil) were more than cut in half, gold and iron ore fell less than one percent in March. Considering iron ore's cyclical nature, that small decline is somewhat surprising but as for Q1, iron ore's performance was much weaker with a decline of over 10.5%. Granted, that is still a far better performance than copper which was down by more than twice that. Given the size of these declines, every one of the commodities highlighted below sits well off of its 52-week high. Gasoline and crude oil are the worst of these at 74.14% and 69.63%, respectively. As for where they finished the quarter relative to their 52-week lows, things are mixed. Gasoline, gold, and silver are off those lows by double-digit percentages while the rest are less than 10% away.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Table-2.png))**

> As with many charts across assets, the technical picture of these commodities looks ugly. Almost every one has broken below significant support levels and safe-haven gold is the only one currently in anything other than a downtrend. Although it finished the month just off of the lows, crude oil fell all the way to its lowest levels since 2002 after crashing through support in February. The same can be said for gasoline. Natural gas remains a pain trade with the downtrend of the past several months still firmly in place.

> Given its safe-haven status, gold has again been an outperformer approaching some of its highest levels of the past decade during the risk asset rout of the past couple of months. But it has recently been a more volatile trade. The yellow metal has yet to break above resistance around 1,700/oz and has even fallen to support around the 50-DMA. Despite also having the precious metal status, silver has been a serial underperformer to gold. Silver never shared gold's rally over the past couple of months as it fell to its lowest levels since 2009.

> As for industrial metals, copper has been hovering around its lowest levels since the final quarter of 2016 after falling through the past year's support around $2.50. On the bright side, the technicals of iron ore have been slightly more constructive as it has still held up at support around $75.

325,"Trying something new: A small portfolio allocation to the ""Worst"" stocks of 2020",,1163,jav13o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jav13o/trying_something_new_a_small_portfolio_allocation/,1602654911.0,"I was doing some research on what analysts of years past said were the worst stock picks of previous years. I decided to do some performance analysis of these picks.

In 2012, a financial [article](https://moneymorning.com/2012/12/31/the-best-and-worst-stocks-of-2012/) wrote that these were the 5 ""Best"" stock picks of the year:

**PulteGroup Inc (PHM)** \- It's had some volatility but overall has grown by about 180% in 8 years

**Sprint (S)** \- Pulling data is hard but it appears that Sprint was pretty volatile but overall had a nice run, then a decline, until it was bought at 280% above its 2012 price

**Whirlpool Corp (WHR)** \- It had some volatile growth but is currently sitting at 99% growth from its 2012 price

**Expedia (EXPE)** \- It had a nice period of a lot of growth but COVID hit it hard. It's now sitting at 59% up from its 2012 price

**Bank of America (BAC)** \- It grew quite a bit for a while but it hasn't fully recovered from COVID yet. It's currently up 135% from its 2012 price

**If you had invested $1k in the 5 ""Best"" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on about $2500, or over 150% growth.**

Now let's see what the ""Worst"" stocks of 2012 were:

**Radioshack (RSH)** \- Sold in 2015 having lost effectively 100% of 2012 value

**SUPERVALU Inc (SVU)** \- Immediately experienced a 3 year 500% run-up, fell, then was sold in 2018 up 62% from 2012 value

**Apollo Group (APOL)** \- Sold in 2015 at 50% less than its 2012 value

**Best Buy Inc (BBY)** \- Almost immediately after the author hit send, this stock had an eight year run-up. It is now up 900% the value it was in 2012

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** \- It took a few years but eventually had a run-up over 3400%. AMD, everyone. This was among the ""worst stocks of 2012.

**If you had invested $1k in the 5 ""Worst"" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on over $9000, or over 800% growth.**

If you had taken all that many and just bought VOO in 2012, you'd be sitting at about **145% growth.**

Of course, AMD is the real diamond here. Without it, this outcome would look different.

**But even if we remove AMD, the other 4 ""worst"" stocks would have seen 140% growth.**

**What does this all mean?**

I think it means you shouldn't *necessarily* overlook ""bad"" stocks. Of course, do your due diligence. And definitely don't invest all your eggs there. But conversely, don't ignore picks just because someone tells you to. It might be worthwhile to keep a few ""bad"" eggs in a small basket of your larger portfolio. You never know what will come roaring back in five to ten years.",261,stocks

The outlook looks worse and worse for cruise line operators this 2020.  

BUT if COVID-19 recedes quickly, travel will likely resume quickly. Rapidly declining fuel prices could also help benefit the cost structure to a greater degree, due to Carnival’s floating energy prices. 

Having said that I’m waiting for an entry price of $12, and I hope we scrape that today so I can hold some Carnival for the coming months. It’s more risk than I would usually take on, but I see potential upside.

Adding TikTok would make Microsoft a major player in the digital ad business, which currently has 70% of market share going to Google, Facebook, and Amazon, according to eMarketer.

Among 18 to 24 year-olds, only 17% use Microsoft-owned LinkedIn. For TikTok, that number is more than double at 42%. Only Instagram (82%), Twitter (46%), and Facebook (46%) have a greater reach with young adults.

Around 90% of Microsoft’s $1.6 trillion current valuation can be attributed to its enterprise cloud strategy, including Azure and Office 365, according to Wedbush. Acquiring TikTok would help Microsoft diversify its business and find new areas for growth.

The deal is the second-largest acquisition of a North American restaurant chain in at least a decade, behind the $13.3 billion deal for Tim Hortons by Restaurant Brands International Inc. in 2014, according to investment data provider Dealogic. Inspire, the owner of Arby’s and other chains that is backed by private-equity firm Roark Capital, said the deal will make it the second-largest U.S. restaurant chain by domestic sales after McDonald’s Corp. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, the companies said on Friday.

Inspire said its all-cash deal to take the owner of Dunkin’ coffee shops and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores private would value it at $106.50 a share, a 20% premium to its closing price on Oct. 23, before the New York Times reported last weekend that the two companies were discussing a possible deal.

The price of $106.50 a share would give Dunkin’ a market valuation of $8.8 billion. The chain’s stock closed on Friday at $100, up 32% this year.

Goldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.

The analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio’s NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that “the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.”

What’s changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.

The analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio’s American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.

Nio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, “making it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,” the Goldman analysts said.

Existing public charging stalls are often busy, but within “10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.”

“In addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,” they said.

Nio’s ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday’s prices.

The iPhone made a flashy and highly-anticipated entrance to the Indian market, where Apple sold the devices through Indian carriers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India. But in the 12 years since, Apple’s captured just 2% of India’s smartphone market, which now totals a half billion users. By contrast, it owns 46% of the market in the U.S. and 8.5% in China.

In 2019, the average smartphone sold in India cost roughly $160, whereas iPhones range from $400 to over $1,000. The disparity helps explain why Apple holds a 49% share of the premium smartphone market in India but only 2% of the overall market.

In February, Cook announced that Apple would open its first retail store in India in 2021. “We like to do things our way,” Cook said of opening the first brick-and-mortar store in India on an earnings call.

""Nvidia (is) benefiting from continued massive demand for graphics cards, according to our supply-chain measurements,"" Eric Ross, chief investment strategist for Cascend Securities, said in a note to clients. Current-quarter demand looks ""like a holiday quarter,"" he said.

""We're not a fan of the Arm acquisition because there are huge hurdles in approval,"" Ross said. ""There is a high likelihood this deal will die at the regulators (we're thinking China).""

The deal will require regulatory approval from the U.S., U.K., European Union and China.

343,Trump Administration Seeks to Delist U.S.-Listed Chinese Companies for Blocking Audit Inspections,News,1115,i7goem,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7goem/trump_administration_seeks_to_delist_uslisted/,1597103317.0,"The Donald Trump administration issued a set of recommendations intended to address the long-running inability of the U.S. audit regulator—the PCAOB—to inspect accounting firms based in China whose audit clients are listed in U.S. stock markets. One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.

For Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.

The new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.

Details of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

JPMorgan’s new QuickAccept service lets businesses take card payments within minutes, either through a mobile app or a contactless card reader, and users will see sales hit their Chase accounts on the same day.

That fast funding is offered free, unlike competitors including Square, which typically take a day or more and charge a 1.5% fee to make instant transfers.

The bank designed its QuickAccept card reader, a hardware device that processes card payments via tap, dip or swipe, internally with the help of a team gained from its 2017 WePay acquisition.

JPMorgan will soon migrate “a large portion” of its more than three million small business customers to the new service, said Jen Roberts, CEO of the Chase business banking unit.

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
> Weekend action?
> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
> Cutting forecasts
> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&P 500 Stocks Up This Week

> There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**

> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

348,For those who are wondering when is a good time to invest...,Advice,1085,fhj1eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhj1eb/for_those_who_are_wondering_when_is_a_good_time/,1584030533.0,"**Disclaimer:** No one knows when the bottom of this market is going to hit. I implore all of you to do your homework before making any purchases. Keep in mind these thoughts are from a long-term investor. If you are a short-term investor this may not mesh with what you think. 

The time is now. While everyone else is panicking this is your chance to find good discounts. Just make sure to follow some simple rules:

1. If you have no idea what to invest in, invest in big names like Coke (KO), Microsoft (MSFT), Bank of America (BAC), or ETF's such as SPY, QQQ, VOO etc. It is really important that you don't put all your eggs in 1 basket so spread out your investments among the big names you know or an ETF to cover you. **This is the ""set it and forget it"" route. Invest in these types of companies/ETF's and don't look at your account for a while.**
2. If you are feeling a little more gutsy you can invest in some companies that have been hit hard by the world events. Think banks, oil, leisure companies (like carnival (CCL)), think Airlines (DAL, AAL, etc.) Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), BP (BP), and others. **I don't advise you doing this unless you can stomach heavy negative swings. I can't stress this enough.**
3. Remember you are going to see wild swings from day to day. Don't let positive days make you feel like you know everything, and conversely, don't let red days make you feel like you have lost it all and you never should have done this in the first place. It is really important to keep your emotions out of the market. which leads to my next point.
4. **Only invest money you can afford to invest (aka: you will be fine without that money for at least 12 months)**. If you can't afford it and you invest you are basically gambling and there is no way to be rational with money you cannot afford to be without.

Right now is a great time to invest because there are companies out there that are heavily discounted that normally aren't this cheap. Do your best to take advantage of this moment, and try to keep a cool head while the general public is not calm.

Edit: Wow RIP my inbox -- I want to first say to some who have been suggesting. **I don't know when the bottom is coming and I am not trying to call or predict the bottom.** Anyone who is telling you they know when the bottom is coming -- don't listen to them. I highly advise all who are interested to look into  [Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp). This is mainly the strategy I am using during this time, I am not advocating sinking your entire liquidity into one day!

**Also since I have your attention let me hijack my own post and help others!**

1. If you are brand new to investing please visit the sidebar!!! it has fantastic info! (like this link for example:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index))
2. If you would like a resource that covers a lot of investing basics -- [www.investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com) check out the education tab, and try out their simulator (really helped me when  I first started).
3. Please do your DD -- [www.finviz.com](https://www.finviz.com) is fantastic for this (and if you don't know how to read a lot of the acronyms or what they mean, you can look them up on investopedia!)

It's a cool company with a bold vision and I hope that this analysis provides value for some people.

**NOTE** I own a few shares of BYND and I do not recommend you buy without doing your own research

-----------------------

**Reasons** **for** **plant** **based** **meat** **market** **growth**

----------------------

1. Consumer behavior is changing along with worries of beef consumption due to climate change. 

2. Increasing awareness of health benefits provided by plant based meat. 

3. Potential for lower prices due to economies of scale as plant-based meat industry grows

4. Logical economic efficiency in plant-based meat production versus animal based meat. 

Plant based: Agriculture → meat

Animal based: Agriculture → animal → meat

----------------------

**Reasons** **why** **Beyond** **Meat** **will** **lead** **the** **plant** **based** **meat** **industry**

--------------------

1. Current market leader, incredible growth numbers and market share gains over time, despite traditional meat companies starting plant programs. 

2. Strategic partnerships with businesses such as Del Taco, Dunkin, Carl's Jr, Subway, Denny’s, Hardees, TGI Fridays, KFC, Kroger, WholeFoods, Starbucks, Sam’s Club, Costco, Target, Publix, Walmart & many more

3. Strong management team. Ethan Brown is a charismatic, visionary CEO. 

4. Beyond is the most recognized plant-based meat brand in the U.S. According to the most recent conference call, 5% of U.S. households purchased Beyond Meat products (Up 33% from January) and the repeat purchase rate rose to 50%, from 45% from January. 

5. Beyond has seen significant growth in China, with their launch into Starbucks, Yum Brands China, and grocery locations such as Freshippo (operated by Alibaba)

6. 7% of revenue currently goes towards R&D in order to ride the lowering cost curve towards lower prices than animal based meat.

7. Management aims for the start of 2024 to have lower price than animal based meat in one of beef, pork or poultry. 

--------------------

**Risks** **and** **potential** **downfalls**

-----------------------

1. Beyond’s brand name could be tarnished and cause them to lose market share.

2. Legacy meat companies can outspend Beyond and take market share of plant based meat future

3. Consumers could be less receptive to plant based meat and climate change/health benefits could be seen as overblown.

4. Beyond isn’t able to innovate enough to lower costs & prices in line with animal based meat

5. Studies come out showing Beyond’s products have adverse health effects. (Despite the recent University of Michigan study showing the health benefits of Beyond)

6. Plant based market never overtakes animal based market (3 & 4)

7. Plant based meat becomes comoticized and Beyond is unable to become consistently profitable.

----------------

**Price** **Targets** (**5** **year** **timeline**)

------------------

1. Current market cap of $7.9 billion, compared with Tyson Foods’ $24 billion (3X)

2. Current sales estimate of $500 million expected 2020 compared with Tyson’s $43 billion (86X). Revenue is best measure of 
valuation due to high growth 

3. 2023 sales estimate of $1.23 billion compared with Tyson’s $45 billion expected (assuming linear growth). (36X). 

4. 2023 sales estimates could easily be much higher than 1.23 billion. Especially if costs & prices keep declining + more strategic partnerships develop. I’m estimating sales closer to $2 billion in my bull case. This would mean a P/S ratio of 4. 

5. If the P/S ratio is around 15 in 2023, Beyond would be undervalued by 3.75X in 2023.

-----------------------

**Bull** **Case**: **$804** **price** **target** (in 2025)

P/S of 10, Revenue of $5 billion, 58.5% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based meat market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 100 billion in 2025 (from 0.605% to 5% of global meat market)

* Price of plant based meat is lower than that of animal based meat in the chicken, poultry and beef market (management target is for one of these markets by 2024). 

* Climate change & health concerns drastically push demand higher, government incentives are also a possibility under a more progressive 2024 legislation. 

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 global market share in the plant based meat market rises to 5% market share in 2025. 

* More big time strategic partnerships with major foodservice companies (possibly McDonalds) 

* Brand penetration continues to increase

* Internationally distribution network expands

* Substantial expansion into China and Southeast Asia
 
* Competitors fail to innovate at the same rate of Beyond and have higher prices than Beyond

3) Price/Sales ratio of 10, implying high future growth, but a lower rate than the 58.5% annual growth rate from the last 5 years (2020-2025). 

* Their current price/sales ratio is 19.5  

* Beyond deserves a much higher P/S ratio than traditional meat companies. Their current gross margin of 35% is three times greater than Tyson 12% gross margin. 

* Net profit margin will increase over time as they leverage economies of scale with the growth of their operation. 

---------------------

**Median** **Case**: **$385** **price** **target** (in 2025)

P/S of 10, Revenue of $2.4 billion, 37% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 60 billion in 2025. 
(from 0.605% to 3% of global meat market)

* Plant based meat is lower than that of animal based meat in one of the chicken, poultry or pork markets. (management target is for one of these markets by 2024). 

* Climate change and health concerns increase demand moderately over time, governments don’t intervene in market pricing with subsidies 

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 market share in the plant based meat market rises to 4% market share in 2025. 

* More big time strategic partnerships with major foodservice companies (possibly McDonalds) 

* Brand recognition continues to increase

* Internationally distribution network expands 

* Expansion into China grows, but not as quickly

* Competitors fail to innovate at the same rate of Beyond and have higher prices than Beyond

3) Price/Sales ratio of 10, implying high future growth, but a lower rate than the 37% annual rate from the last 5 years (2020-2025). 

* Their current price/sales ratio is 19.5
 
* Beyond deserves a much higher P/S ratio than traditional meat companies. Their current gross margin of 35% is three times greater than Tyson 12% gross margin. 

--------------------

**Bear** **Case**: **$108** **price** **target** (in 2025)

7.5 P/S, $900 million revenue, 12.5% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 30 billion in 2025. 
((from 0.605% to 1.5% of global meat market)

* Prices of Beyond Meat’s plant based products are slightly above that of animal based products

* Climate change and health benefits don’t have a significant increase on demand

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 market share in the plant based meat market rises slightly to 3% market share in 2025. 

* Beyond loses traction in increasing partnerships and strikes out on companies such as McDonalds. 

* Brand recognition is not a significant factor 

* International growth slows down

* Beyond strikes out in China

* Competition increases and stunts Beyond’s market share growth

3) Price/Sales ratio of 7.5, implying slowing future growth.

* The 12.5% annual growth rate over the last five years shows signs of slowing down.

* Although Beyond still has a higher P/S ratio compared to traditional meat companies, a slowing growth rate limits their potential. 

* The 3X gross margin compared to Tyson is the reason why the P/S ratio isn’t lower than 7.5.

352,"Opinion/Rant: When there is a true bottom/recession, buying won't be easy",,1074,g2m075,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g2m075/opinionrant_when_there_is_a_true_bottomrecession/,1587066039.0,"I see a lot of posters on here, social media, friends and family, saying the same stuff (especially new ""investors""). ""This market is bs!"".

Many people are pissed, because according to them, the market is reacting correctly.

These people think because when there's a global pandemic, the market has to plummet, and you just buy everything at a discount and get rich, right? Shocker... 99% of investors are thinking the same thing.

All I can say is, when there is a true bottom and fear, buying won't be easy at all (unless you and your family are already rich with job security and healthy). Once most people burn through their savings; have to make decisions like which bill to pay first, should I keep on investing and take on debt, or pay my debts first?.... Once those kind of scary decisions arise and most people lose their faith in the market is when we will be in true bottom territory.

Just a little rant because people think it's as easy as just being an opportunist.  It's not. Because once the opportunity finally comes, you probably won't have the resources to make the moves.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1:

Looks like I offended a lot of people, which was not my intention. I am not trying to predict the bottom at all. I know I don't know.

All I was saying was is, when this ""bottom"" happens, it will be at a point where most people are scared. Whether it be because they are in debt or because they have lost faith in the market. It's not going to be as easy ""this is cheap, buy now, I will get returns a few years from now"". There's a lot of new investors thinking it's that easy.

Risks aren't easy. Those 10% drops we saw several weeks ago was child's play. You'll know what I mean if/when it happens. When you are legit scared to put money in because you lost faith in the market and economy.

I'm an Average Joe. I'm continuing do DCAing and buying at my usual rate.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

I guess I offended people with this as well:

""unless you and your family are already rich with job security and healthy""

That definitely came out wrong. I didn't mean that to rich shame.

I still believe in America. And there will still be opportunities. But once again, I think the idea of just buying at this bottom is easier said than done, especially for people who aren't already wealthy or financially stable. And for those that do have the ballz to buy big in a fearful market, I think 9 out of 10 (and that's being VERY generous), will get burnt trying to make it during these hard times. But that's another topic.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
> The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.
*****
> “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
> For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
> “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
> # Stimulus one-two punch
> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
> “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
> Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
> # Credit un-crunching
> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
> “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

> “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

> “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

> “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",205,stocks
354,Jim Cramer's checklist of what an investor should analyze when researching a company - From the 1990s/2000s - Using Nike as an example - Taken from my schools archive,,1058,jsjdxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jsjdxt/jim_cramers_checklist_of_what_an_investor_should/,1605138012.0,"“Bulls and Bears make money, but Hogs get slaughtered.”

1. There must be demand for the company’s products. Nike’s been creating demand for decades, thanks to the “cool factor” supported by sharp advertising and clothing that looks good, feels comfortable and lets everyone know you’re an athlete. 

2. The company’s total addressable market. In other words, how big the market is for its products. Cramer also likes to know where it sits in the pecking order. Nike is the dominant player in footwear and number two in apparel. 

3. Are there any catalysts that can power the stock higher? Nike has several catalysts, like the Summer Olympics. 

4. Other ways to look into the future. Nike has a company-specific key metric called future orders, which allows customers to order merchandise six months ahead.

5. The company’s ability to pass costs onto the customers. Nike made it clear in the conference call that it had no trouble passing on raw costs through price increases, Cramer said. 

6. It’s important to understand the geographic breakdown of the business. Nike’s fastest growing geographies are emerging markets, which is up 26 percent year-over-year. China is up 28 percent and the U.S. is up 21 percent. Western Europe and Japan are still challenging environments, but they’re offset by the strength elsewhere.

7. Wall Street loves accelerating revenue growth. Nike has this across multiple product categories in both developed and developing markets.

8. Inventory. When companies with retail components have too much inventory, it can be a problem since they’ll have to discount the older products before bringing in a new product. Nike’s unit inventory growth outpaced its sales growth, but since absolute unit levels have ""plateaued,"" Cramer is not concerned. 

9. Good companies are always reinventing themselves and their products. Nike is doing this, Cramer said, with new technology in its shoes and marketing. 

10. Company culture. Nike is focused on improving the way they work. This is the least important item. 

&#x200B;

When Jim Cramer worked at his hedge fund, he asked analysts the following eight questions: 

No. 1: What's goingto make this stock go up, besides the stock market?

No. 2: Why is it going to go up? Is there something time sensitive?

No. 3: Is this the best time to buy it?

No. 4: Have you missed a lot of the move? How much has the stock gone up without you? Is it extended on a technical basis?

No. 5: Should you wait until it comes down a bit more? What's the harm?

No. 6: What do you know about this stock that others are missing? Is your instinct to buy based on general knowledge, and you're working on a herd mentality? Have you listened to the conference calls and done the research, or are you flying blind?

That exercise may have now entered the final stages, raising the odds for a 2021 breakout that signals another year of superior returns and a potential trip up to the $300 level.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Microsoft stock has doubled in price since the end of 2018.

Institutional investors have been loading up on the stock in the fourth quarter

The stock could post superior returns for the third year in a row in 2021.

A symmetrical triangle breakout may have to wait for January tax-selling pressure to ease.

358,iPhone 12 launches in China to strong demand despite stiff competition for Apple in 5G smartphones,,1055,jgl2db,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jgl2db/iphone_12_launches_in_china_to_strong_demand/,1603451354.0,"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/iphone-12-launches-china-strong-073637889.html

Compared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China. The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.

The new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.

Sales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.

362,For Those Who Don't Understand the Inevitable Short Squeeze with GME,,1039,k688qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/,1607035795.0,"First, what is a short?

The first concept to understand is you **sell** to **open**, and **buy** to **close**.

Your brokerage will lend you x amount of shares and sell them on your behalf on the market. That you is **selling** to **open** the short position.

When you cover your position you **buy** to **close** the position.   
Let's say you short GME at $15.80 for 1000 shares and the price drops to $12. You would borrow 1000 shares from your broker that are sold on the market at $15.80, you decide to close your position at $12 where you would then buy those 1000 shares at $12/share and give them back to the broker. You would profit $3.80/share so $3800.

But what if the price goes up? Well, you have **cover** that position. So if you short GME at $15.80 and it goes up to $16.20 you are already in the hole $0.40/share. 

**Key Point:** Shorting happens on a **margin** account. That means, it's not actually your money either. It's the brokerages. If you are losing enough money you will go into what is called a **house call** which essentially will force you to cover your position. 

Moral of the story, if you drive the price up, you will force short positions to either cover or double down.   
The case of GME is extremely interesting because there is over 100% short interest, meaning there are more shorts than actual volume.

THIS is what causes a short squeeze. This is also why you can't expect it to happen over night.

Short Position A might be Bob from Kentucky who has a $350,000 margin account and he shorted at 15.80, once it gets to 16.50 we wants out because he's already losing so much and it's not worth the risk.

Short Position B might be Bank of A lot of Power who has a $4BN margin account and can wait years for it to fail, so they have no need to cover their positions unless it's looking really bad long term. (Like if this Cohen thing happens)

As shorts cover their positions, they are forced to buy at a higher price than they shorted, driving the stock price up. This will lead to more short positions covering driving the price up some more, leading to more short positions doing the same. All the way up to the whales who have massive short positions. 

GME has over 100% short interest, has formed a cup and handle, and the potential Cohen takeover is right around the corner. A squeeze will happen.

Hope this helps!

EDIT:

Regarding GME specifically. The earnings call on 12/8 has two possible outcomes.

1. Cohens letters are addressed and either GME begins moving forward and meets his demands or he gets a controlling position in the company.

2. Cohens letters are ignored.

If case 2 happens there are two possible outcomes.

1. Cohen initiates a hostile takeover
2. Cohen gives up the fight and sells his shares (this is the risk of this play, every other circumstance leads to a squeeze, this one leads to the shorts winning and GME heading for the toilet, however this is unlikely, it’s not like GME wants to go out of business, so it’s very unlikely Cohen and his public letters are ignored)",485,stocks

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks.  Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources,  renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE:  It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings.  This ETF tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings:  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

QCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies.  For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **32.34%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**
* Semiconductors - **13.18%**
* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**
* Electrical Components & Equipment - **6.97%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**
* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**
* Construction Supplies & Fixtures - **2.45%**
* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**

Top 10 Holdings:  NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,**  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)**

# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:

PBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **44.46%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**
* Semiconductors - **7.36%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**
* Construction & Engineering - **4.47%**
* Industrial Machinery & Equipment - **3.97%**
* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.76%**
* Agricultural Chemicals - **2.17%**

Top 10 Holdings: (Remember 4% cap)  JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. Sponsored ADR **3.85%,** NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **3.12%,** Lithium Americas Corp. **3.06%,** Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR **3.02%,** SunPower Corporation **2.93%,** Livent Corporation **2.85%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **2.69%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **2.68%,** Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. **2.61%,** Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!

Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance. 

Edit 2: One User reccomended CNRG, it is similar to PBW with slightly different weighting and more expose to Renewable Energy Equipment and Services. Definitely worth a closer look and consideration!

Edit 3: To the user that awarded the Platinum, you seriously made my night. I will drink a beer for you, thankyou!",129,stocks

Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general -  private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.

JPow's cover story for buying junk bonds is that he is helping corporations so they can keep American jobs intact. That is a total lie. Corporations will get all this free money and then lay off people anyway during the summer. All the free money will go to the wall street elite and billionaires.

Edit: Let me make it even simpler. Shadow banker (evil blood sucking parasite of wall street) gives money to company XYZ and company XYZ gives a high yield bond aka junk bond to the shadow banker. Company XYZ loses all revenue because of corona. Mr. shadow banker is now holding a worthless bond because XYZ went bankrupt and cannot pay the interest payments anymore. Mr. shadow banker very sad and maybe going broke too. Oh wait, here comes JPow with his unlimited money printer. JPow buys this bond from Mr. Shadow banker who gets saved from his risky loan and mr. shadow banker gets all his money back. The fed now owns this risky bond on the back of the American tax payer but this bond will likely be worthless since company XYZ can never pay back the loan. JPow saved the shadow banker, question is will JPow save you when you are homeless and starving?

Edit: Some people saying, you just don't understand this stuff. It's too complicated. Don't worry the billionaires know what they are doing. Well you know what, if its that complicated and confusing it probably shouldn't be happening.

Stocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.

Over the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said “I want to do a bigger number than she wants \[Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal\]. That doesn’t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.” These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump’s endorsement can help move the needle.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson said, “While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.”

According to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.

In Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into ""Level Five"" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. London is an area of “high alert” meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

Edit 3: I went ahead and bouts some F, UNM and CTL but honestly I’m not seeing much out there. Everything is priced either fairly or overpriced and I’m not seeing any deals. I think we are at the top of this market. 


Edit 2 : Since the MACD is about to cross over and RSI is so high I’m going to wait a few days before investing. FYI. But typically these value buys are good buys even at the top of a market.  


Edit 1: someone was asking what this means

This sorts all companies in the s&amp;amp;amp;p500 by a value function. The function uses quarterly earnings growth, price to book ratio, peg ratio, 52 week change. The list is sorted by each metric and each company is assigned a value. For example the company with the lowest price to book gets 1 point. The company with the second lowest price to book ratio gets 2 points. And so forth. After all the metrics are added up there’s a total value and the entire list is sorted by that total value. Ford has a total value of 236 which means it’s the best of all the metrics combined. and if you look at the numbers you can see why. Last quarter’s EPS went up 600%. 

It’s then up to you to examine the company and decide if you want to buy. Looking at Ford it’s revenue went down 50% and it’s EPS was already low so it didn’t take much for it to rise 600%. Net income and cash on hand went up so they must have laid off lot of people. 

You do this for every stock etc. this is just to give you a list of companies that stand out for you to pay attention to and possibly invest in. Based on this I would say Ford will survive and it’s a good buy at these prices. But you have to make your own mind up. That lost revenue looks terrible.

Nearly every company has reported Q2 earnings. 



I was very surprised to see Ford (F) at the top of the list. UNM looks attractive although I wish I would have got in at $17. 

HIG also looks attractive. There's a lot of stocks that look attractive that didn't show up last time I posted because I only included companies that had reported earnings. Now that most have reported earnings I can feel more confident making these value purchases. 

Here is is a list sorted by industry and filtered by only good buys with a total value of 1000 or less (the smaller the number the better the score)

375,A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”,Discussion,1004,k7cq51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k7cq51/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/,1607192796.0,"We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them.

It is great that everyone is fighting the good fight and telling hedge funds to shove it, and I believe that this event will be impactful in the years to come.

That said, when you do buy, do it for the cause. Because you like the stock. **Because you want to expose how shit the system is**. Not cause you expect that you will make anything from this trade and that you will be able to pay of your tuition fees and home loans, or because you think that you are giving the middle finger to big money, because you are not. 

This is simply due to the sheer information and technology asymmetry.

Reddit's plan is in plain sight for all of the institutions to see. Long thesis tied to gamma and short squeeze on Friday, buy and hold and remove limits to avoid giving brokers information, ""get out before the bubble bursts"". Most new players are on platforms that they themselves understand less than institutional investors. It is hubris to assume that institutions with all their experience with manipulation and their PhDs that literally spend their entire lives studying specific topics, yes, even short interest and how it impacts the markets, will not have a counter strategy for the very obvious retail play. 

And the worst thing is that you do not know what it is; the price could be $1000 and back to $200 within minutes tomorrow if they so choose to ride the retail pump and dump, there could be no gamma squeeze at all as perhaps all of their shorts have already moved out in the dip to 100 today. What I am saying is that whatever happens tomorrow or the week after, the probability is very high that the institutions will still eat first, and the lucky initial buyers second, and the rest is likely going to be a dice roll.

On the other hand, I am going to make the sweeping assumption that most retail players have a surface level understanding on the strategies institutions are taking on this event. There has been a lot of focus on Melvin (almost a scapegoat at this point) and Citadel, but what about other players like Blackrock that are as strong and have unknown plans for the stock? Most will not understand the power dynamics between the organizations. One obvious example was Citadel snapping up Melvin in all of the chaos. Many other similar transactions are going on behind the scenes. Finally, they may underestimate the technology that they have at their disposal. People are paid millions to make their trades milliseconds faster, their codes a few percentage points more efficient - again, not resources your average investor has access to.

The bright spot is the media coverage has been very negative towards malpractices in the finance industry and there will surely be some sort of legal reform. If you are getting in this late in the game and are willing to ride or die, do it because you are bringing down RH and co., and because you are exposing more scummy practices to the world to see.

The markets were expecting 3 million jobless, but got over 6.6 million jobless just from last week. This is on top of the 3.3 million the week before. These are enormous numbers and I know we were expecting this and the Government is covering unemployment. But the question is: How many of these jobs will come back? – My worry is a lot of them will Not.
Before the economic data came in global markets had a positive move. In Asia, most markets were in the green, with South Korea leading the way, up 2.35%. Chinese indexes were up around 2%, while Japan was the only major market in the red, down -1.35%.
European markets are trading right now with slight gains. German, British and French stocks started in the green, declined twice to neutral and right now (8 30AM ET) are trading up around 0.5%.
US futures have been green all night, raising more than 2% when Europe opened. But as the US is waking up, we have seen declines and right now they are hovering around 1.5% up.
The outbreak is still spreading with total new cases still raising. We will probably hit 1000000 cases worldwide today. But good news is coming from the hardest hit places, with Italy and New York reporting less new cases than previous days. At the same time there are spikes in cases all around the USA and this could pose difficulties in fighting the spread.

Oil is in the news, up 11% after remarks from President Trump that Russia and Saudi Arabia are talking to reach deal. I have been talking about oil in the past two days and I am very glad about this move, since it was very much expected. Even at 22.20, it is a good buy, since there is constant upward movement. Even if it goes up another 10%, it will still be at 25$, which is not sustainable for most US manufacturers. The top oil executives are headed to the White House tomorrow and all of this movement is due to expectations that the Government will either help the industry or pressure Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production. Whatever the case, a great way to make big gains.
Last Thursday when we got the 3 million number the stock market shoot up and had one of the best days in this crises. This was a very unusual and mislead rally that lead to significant declines in the next two trading days.
My advice is do not enter at the open, let the market stabilize and access the new numbers and if you see stocks erasing the pre-market gains that is the mark to sell and get in for a 0.5-1% profit. Have tight ranges, small stop losses and take profits, do not get greedy it is still very volatile.

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks.

An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company’s shares.

“Big-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,” Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

“I’d say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,” Kaufman added.

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?

There is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?

As valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.

For sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.

I know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future.

**Lithography techniques**

Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [\[1\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).

Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\[2\]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.\[3\] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. \[4\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice…

Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together)

**The problems with 10nm**

Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. \[5\] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. 

(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)  


Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build.

Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that 

1) they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS

2) The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. 

These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.

When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \[6\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \[7\] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\[8\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.

**7nm and beyond**

So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. 

There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\[9\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).

The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \[10\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \[11\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. 

\[12\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.

Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. 

**Conclusion**

I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

The lower rating the better. Each rating is summed to give the total rating.   

For example all s&amp;p500 companies are sorted by priceToBookValue ratio. The number 1 company receives 1 point the number 2 company receives 2 points and so forth.  

This is repeated for the other two metrics. 

It would be nice if a company excelled at all three metrics and only received 3 points total but that's not realistic. A low profit to book value means the company stock price is under valued. If such a company also has good quarterly earnings growth and a good forward outlook then it is super under valued. And that is the point of this exercise.

Edit: this one divides eps by stock share price so we can get a more accurate picture of earnings per dollar. By doing this I noticed DAL was kind of high on the list so i'm going to add another metric of profit margin to try and weed out companies that have less cash to work with and may be at risk for bankruptcy. 

doc (removed)


Edit 2:

Ok I think this one is the most accurate. Instead of using trailing and forward eps and dividing by stock price I'm just using forwardPE. I also take into account pegRatio and if either PE or pegRatio are negative the company gets dinged hard (like with dal or luv).

So this gives us a list of companies that will survive the pandemic and are under priced.

Enjoy!

doc (removed)


Edit 3:

Added more details here including market price, earnings date, industry, and analyst recommendations. Even if the stock appears undervalued these analysts may know more than i do. You can go down the list and pick all the strong buys. Should be a good deal!

I added the industry because I plan on making a ""diversified"" portfolio out of this

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y03Nkgh1g-lixkOjxL65hCkz1NQg3JKx_dY2x6Nn8sM/edit?usp=sharing

Edit 4:

With this list I severely penalized any company that had negative earnings or growth. The top 318 companies are clearly set apart from the bottom companies.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRtgLmolBpre5nDeO7UlvCyuRcmgE-QMFGj7QwHs1lw/edit#gid=328425522

Edit 5:

Same as above with severe penalty but in addition to having a column for priceToBook I also included one for 52WeekAverage which will give more weight to those stocks that were hardest hit. So this is is the real gem here. It should have companies with a positive future earning outlook with the lowest price.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKo6WyTWvEAqqSv2Vn_eVNUGaEP-vGt151TBmOo_C5g

Edit 6:

Same as above but sorted by industry so you can make your own portfolio. Pick the first one or two stocks from each industry. I also put analyst ratings next to my rating. Higher is better. Note this spreadsheet contains ALL companies in the s&p 500. I'm not saying they're all buys. 

Make a copy of this spreadsheet and delete the bottom half from each industry and you'd have a solid portfolio of stocks that are on the cheap

Edit 7:

And finally, my portfolio based off of this. I'll give each industry equal weight even though different industries may have more stocks than others

1. Lisa Su (CEO): sold $11.8M worth of AMD stock in Aug 11, and sold $4.1M in Aug 9.
2. KUMAR DEVINDER (CFO): sold $5M in Aug 11, and sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
3. Bergman Rick (EVP): $1.9M in Aug 9.
4. Papermaster Mark D (CTO): sold $1.25M in Aug 9.
5. GRASBY PAUL DARREN (SVP & CSO): sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
6. Norrod Forrest Eugene (SVP): $934k in Aug 9
7. WOLIN HARRY A (SVP): sold $698k in Aug 9.
8. SMITH DARLA M (CAO): sold $332k in Aug 9.

That is a total of $28.4M in 2 days, which is a lot of profit-taking for a short amount of time.

Will this trend continue as AMD price keeps hitting ATH? Quite possible. This means that more volatility is coming for AMD, which we have already seen recently with all these crazy swings. So don't YOLO/FOMO into AMD because of all the hype.

Chances are, the stocks will probably go up a bit more in the next few weeks and I may be prematurely selling. But I'm going to be laid off in the future and I also think that in the future, the market will drop. A 20% gain since 3 weeks ago seems solid in this uncertain market.

Tesla Stock Hits $780 Raising More Than 80% Since the Start of the Year

Elon Musk’s Tesla has shut the critics with its overwhelming performance in Q4 2019. Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.

Short-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.

On Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company’s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday’s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.

Since the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla’s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.

Stocks don’t always recover. Industries that will most likely take a very long time to recover will be risky, and you will really need to be careful in the travel industry stocks like airlines, cruises, hotels, etc. People aren’t going to feel comfortable traveling as much, and with so many people losing their jobs, the last thing on their mind is what next big cruise they are going to go on when their pockets are empty.

Too many new investors are trying to chase stocks all the way up with FOMO, and it’s not worth it.

Too many investors don’t even understand the business they just purchased shares in, they only bought it because someone on the internet said “It’s going to the moon” or their friend said that this magical penny stock will be the next MSFT, etc.

Too many investors don’t look at the balance sheet of the companies stocks they have purchased. I have seen countless posts on here saying “This stock is about to skyrocket! BUY! BUY! BUY!” And you look into the balance sheet and you see why the stock price has been going down for 10+ years, because they are drowning in debt.

There is a company behind every stock, and unless you can understand the company and explain it easily, don’t buy the stock. Stick to what you know, or be optimistic and ready to learn about a company so you know where your money is going.

TLDR: Please read the balance sheet, and understand the company behind the stocks you are purchasing. Don’t follow the herd. Risk doesn’t always lead to reward. Have a good day!",222,stocks

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

When the Harry Potter books first came out, there was a lot of demand. It might have been profitable to borrow a copy from the public library and sell it on eBay. Sure, you now owed a copy to the library and they were charging you late fees; but you just made $50 and eventually you'd pick up a used copy for $5 once the hype died down and you'd finish miles ahead. Unless something crazy happened like every copy of the Harry Potter books being sold out for months and all the used ones going for more than you sold your library book for. Then you'd be watching the cost of the books keep rising and you'd be accumulating late fees to boot. And since people were still wanting to read the book, the library would have to buy a replacement for the book you hadn't returned while they waited for you to return it. Now imagine that happening on a massive scale, creating tons of demand with limited supply. That is what is happening with GME. The short sellers haven't returned their library books yet and they are paying more and more late fees while they wait for the price of replacement books to come back down. Except the price won't come down and eventually they'll have to start buying books at market price or the cost of the late fees and the opportunity cost of having their resources set aside for replacing library books will make their losses even worse. This will cause more demand, increasing the price of the books, creating even more urgency for degenerate borrows to cut their losses and move on.

Even better, the borrowers are currently committed to returning more books that are actually available to be bought at any price and the publisher is not printing any more.

Nabbing the rights to “No Time to Die,” would have been a major coup for a streaming service and could have helped entice subscribers looking to watch the latest Bond movie.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said companies from China and other countries that do not comply with accounting standards will be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as of the end of 2021.

Mnuchin and other officials recommended the move to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week to ensure that Chinese firms are held to the same standards as U.S. companies, prompting China to call for frank dialogue.

Mnuchin told a White House briefing the SEC was expected to adopt the recommendations. “As of the end of next year ... they all have to comply with the same exact accounting, or they will be delisted on the exchanges,” he said.

The outbreak is spreading rapidly and cases have gone exponentially up in the last couple of days. At this time Europe is considered the epicenter with most new cases coming out of here. This is why EU countries will be shutting their borders to prevent people from moving around and spreading the virus. In the USA, all of the 50 states have also confirmed cases.
All of this bad news is hitting the markets hard. China and Japan had the smallest impacts last night with their stock markets down less than 2%. South Korea was the worst performer from the Asian markets, down 5%. Europe is still trading while this article is written at 8AM ET, but all markets are in the red around 4-5%.
The US stock futures are limit down and the ETFs are pointing to an implied open of around -6%. Oil had a bad night, down 6% and trading now around 25$.
If Europe is a guide, there will be stricter measures coming to the USA as more and more videos of people parting and going out pop up on the internet. This will further drag the stock market downward.

At the open I expect a decline and we probably will hit the circuit breaker at 7% for the S&P.

I would not get in the market at the open, leave the dust settle, if we hit a breaker, wait for the break and after it you can come in and Buy.

The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple’s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",238,stocks

The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?

Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven’t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. 

While I’m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers’ asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we’re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That’s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.

I don’t like to be bearish, but I’d say that there’s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.

Fundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we’re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.

Because in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... 

...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.



The saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC & Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. 

And I’m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.

People’s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.

So all I’m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they’re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.

479,A Historical Look at the Airlines,Discussion,752,gl6zrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gl6zrm/a_historical_look_at_the_airlines/,1589680378.0,"I’ve remained bearish on the airlines for the past couple months yet the community seems to have a different perspective. In an attempt to understand why so many remain bullish I decided to take a look at how the airlines recovered following the last crises (9/11). I’ve broken down my analysis in order of the airlines market share at the time the last crises started. I’ve also shown what your return would be if you bought in late 2001 and held until today.

For context, an investment in the S&P 500 would have netted a return of **223%**

**1.** American (**-70% ROI**): Despite declaring bankruptcy, investors in American Airlines (Formerly $AMR, now $AAL) would still have a portion of their investment if they held since 2001. It’s highly unlikely investors would have held through the bankruptcy which saw $AMR get delisted and trade as low as 20c a share, but for those that held through the bankruptcy they could have sold for a gain of **100%** in December, 2019. Realistically, for someone who invested in 2001, they would have realized gains no higher than **33%** and likely sold at some point leading up to the bankruptcy.

2. United (**-100% ROI**): The original $UAL stock was wiped out during United Airlines bankruptcy proceedings. It was re-issued under $UAUA until it reverted to its original ticker $UAL after its merger with Continental airlines. Investors in 2001 would have lost their entire investment if they held without selling. On a positive note, for individuals that invested after the re-issue, they could have realized gains as high as **150%**, assuming perfect market timing.

3. Delta (**-100% ROI**): Delta Airlines faced the same fate as United, during their bankruptcy proceedings their stock was cancelled leaving investors with nothing. After emerging from bankruptcy they merged with Northwest Airlines and reissued stock under the ticker symbol $DAL.

4. Northwest (**-100% ROI**): Northwest Airlines also had their stock cancelled during their bankruptcy proceedings. They merged with Delta in 2008.

5. US Airways: **(-100% ROI**): Another airline that declared chapter 11 bankruptcy and cancelled their shares. US Airways later merged with American Airlines and currently trades under $AAL.

6. Continental (**0% ROI???**): Historical data for $CAL is hard to come by. From what I can find $CAL was never delisted or cancelled as Continental airlines never declared bankruptcy in the 2000s. They later merged with United where $CAL shareholders received 1.05 shares of $UAL. Based on the fact that $CAL was trading around $20 in late 2001, an investment held until today would have netted about a 0% ROI before dividends.

7. Southwest (**22% ROI**): We have a winner!! If you invested in the airlines after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and chose the 7th largest airline as your bread winner you could have realized gains of 22%! Throughout the last 20 years, shareholders could have seen gains as high as **200%** if they sold near the 2018 highs. Bottom line, even with perfect market timing, an investment in an index fund would have outperformed Southwest ($LUV).

Analyzing all these companies was a lot harder than I imagined. Nonetheless, based on historical similarities between 9/11 and today's COVID-19 it’s clear any investment in the airlines is risky. A long-term investment could very easily result in a 100% loss. It might be worth performing additional technical analysis to determine if a potential swing trade could be profitable, my gut would remain bearish on swing trading but we’ll save that for a later date.

Tldr; You stand a 57% chance of losing everything based on historical trends.",183,stocks

481,If you invested in the Nikkei 225 at its all time peak in December 1989 ...,,746,hcje60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hcje60/if_you_invested_in_the_nikkei_225_at_its_all_time/,1592646006.0,"You would have lost 38% after 30 years in December 2019. However if you accumulated all those dividends you would have made up 30% of that such that you would only be down 8%.

That requires you having the absolute worst timing. If instead you invested at the top of the ""suckers"" rally in August of 1990, you would have only lost 26%, and with reinvesting dividends you would be up 8.5%.

If instead you invested in 1988 you would only be down 20%, but reinvested dividends would make you up by 18%.

You are only down if you bought at the absolute highest point once and then never bought ever again. At both points around the top, while it seems at first you might still be down, by reinvesting dividends you actually return a small profit.

Inflation of course might mean that 18% over 30 years is a pretty bad return, it must be understood that Japan has a very low inflation rate, sometimes bordering on deflation, and their government bonds sometimes actually have negative interest rates somehow. Japan is a special place.

Normal people don't invest all their money once and then never again, so lets say you DCAed all the way down the Japanese Mega Bear by investing every December.

The money you invested in X year would be up/down Y% or Z% with dividends reinvested

1989, -38%, -8.2%

1990, -0.35%, 47%. Wait 50% returns? I mean after 30 years that isn't great but that is a far cry from this narrative that the Japanese Stock Market only losses you money. 

1991, 6%, 55%

1992, 36%, 98% - Wait how is that possible you would have doubled your money by having been invested for the entirety of the lost decades? By Listening to the Advice of Grandpa Buffet's advice of buying the dip. Even if it dips lower next time you will still be up if you have been reinvesting dividends.

1993, 37%, 97%

1994, 23%, 75%

Honestly you get the picture. While you would have lost 8.2% shirt if you invested all your money at the top of 1989, you would have gained 100% of it back if you invested an equivalent amount of money in 1992.  


Owning Japan's biggest corporations for 30 years would only lose you money if you bought at the equivalent of the peak of the Dotcom AND Housing bubble COMBINED. Even if you overpay for great companies so long as they are great companies you will be just fine as long as you are patient, and so long as you don't go all in at all time highs at the peak of a bubble. If you buy the dip, even the height of the ""suckers"" rally, you will do just fine so long as you are patient. Even with a decades long bear so long as you DCA and have patience owning reliable dividend paying blue chips stocks you can't go wrong. Could you have done better? Of course, but you can't predict the future, might as well just buy companies you want to own when you think you see a good price, or even just doing it regularly with a constant amount of money regardless of the price.",146,stocks

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

Gather around kids, I am now ready to become a professor. First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:

**Shares Outstanding**

The TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.

**Shares Float**

The total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.

Pretend: Stock XYZ has *400M shares float*, *50M shares shorted*, and *daily volume of 10M shares*. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.

**Short Ratio**

The number of *days* it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.

* Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.

**Short Float**

What percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.

* Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) \* 100) shares. So, (50/400) \* 100 = 12.5%.

**Short Interest** **(Shares Shorted)**

Pretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.

**Short Squeeze**

When stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.

But… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.

# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**
*****
> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.
*****
> “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”
*****
> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.
*****
> But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. 
*****
> “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”
*****
> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.
*****
> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.
*****
> “Q2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.
*****
> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.
*****
> “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.
*****
> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.
*****
> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.
*****
> “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”
*****
> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.
*****
> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.
*****
> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.
*****
> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.
*****
> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.
*****
> “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.

> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump

> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 ""ten-baggers"" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.

> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has ""Energy"" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that ""manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control."" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a ""better and safer way to manage pain"" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.

> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.

> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!

> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016

> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)

> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).

> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.

> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**

> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been ""10-baggers"" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**

> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.

> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.

> # News High for Net New Highs

> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.

> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**

*****

> # Breadth Booming

> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.

> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**

> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.

> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950

> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.

> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.

505,Continuing our investing journey from PLTR to DTIL,Ticker Discussion,704,kxwq2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/,1610724455.0,"Hey all! I'm back from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/) 2 months ago! I hope you all are still holding on to PLTR and NIO! I definitely still am. These two are definitely great companies and have much much more room to grow in the future.

I told people following me about DTIL in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/kotsumu/comments/kv5sj1/interesting_tech_worth_keeping_an_eye_on_dtil/) earlier this week and mentioned that I will post it for all sometime soon. I thought to post this on Monday next week, but I couldn't hold in the excitement anymore.

Let's get down to business! CRISPR, if you do not have much background, is a method patented by University of California, Berkley to use an enzyme called Cas9 and a RNA strand to modify the genetic information of organisms. I'm not going to go into detail about how it all works and r/stocks doesn't allow video links, so go to my earlier post this week to see the links to some juicy CRISPR information.

I've been following CRISPR technology for a couple years. However, the timing never felt quite right. Early last year, I was actually looking at EDIT (Editas) but after sorting through some of my thoughts and their documents, I decided not to invest. I really wanted to get into CRISPR but I always had a bias against pharmaceutical companies because of its volatile nature and dependency on drug clearances. There are other reasons but in the end, I decided not to invest and missed out on some big gains It's fine though, I make it a point to look back at opportunities missed once to learn from it and never look back again. There are way too many opportunities out there to waste time regretting. Since I didn't have a good target back then, I just threw some allocated funds into ARKG and called it a day.

You might be wondering why I'm talking about CRISPR when Precision Bioscience doesn't do anything related to CRISPR. It might be evident to you that the CRISPR space is bubbly right now. With CRSP and EDIT at all time highs, it might not be wise to jump in. Luckily for us, Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, free of patents and licenses, that allows gene editing called ARCUS. There are not much information out there publicly due to the proprietary nature of the tech, but the idea seems similar. It uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. The end result is the same, we are still investing in the future of gene editing, we also break free from the licensing restrictions that lock CRSP technology in pharmaceuticals. Yes, that's right, CRISPR doesn't need to only be used in therapeutics, think about what it can do for agriculture and the environment.

In summary here are the precise reasons why I'm starting a small position in Precision Biosciences (pun intended)

* CRISPR is a great new tech but most companies are in the pharmaceutical space
* CRISPR patent woes may slow down innovation
* ARCUS is proprietary and free of licensing constraints to explore the applications of gene editing and its benefits
* I have no way of validating it, but ARCUS is marketed as a less error prone CRISPR. Resulting in more precise genetic modifications.
* With all that said, I believe heavily that gene editing has huge applications in the future not limited to medicine, but in agriculture and the environment as well. Think higher yield, less maintained crops, livestock. Plants/bacteria/organisms that are engineered to solve some environment issues like plastic waste, CO2, or climate change.
* Precision Biosciences does dabble in both medical applications and food via its subsidiary, Elo Life Systems
* CRISPR companies are relatively richly valued (CRSP at 14.5B market cap, EDIT at 5B) whereas DTIL is only valued at 550M indicating that there is a lot of room to grow
* The size of their contracts are smaller, but they do have some recent strategic partnerships with high profile companies like Eli Lilly

With all that said, DTIL seems to be higher risk than some of the other companies that I've posted about previously. They have some cash on hand, albeit not much. It is still enough to give them runway till 2022 where I envision they will need to raise cash again. I plan to be a little bit more conservative with DTIL due to the nature of bio tech companies being volatile. I'll increase my position as I see fit.

As always, please do your own DD!",145,stocks

# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.
*****
> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.
*****
> “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.”
*****
> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.
*****
> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.
*****
> “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’”
*****
> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.
*****
> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.
*****
> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.
*****
> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.
*****
> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.
*****
> ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan.
*****
> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.
*****
> “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.”

Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.

“The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.

Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.”

# Big Annual Declines Are Rare

> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.

> “A positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”

> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?

> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.

> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.

# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After

> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.

> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.

> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.

> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.

# Gold Up, Dollar Down

> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**

> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.

# All or Nothing Days on the Rise

> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.

> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**

> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.

# Volatility Remains High

> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.

> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.

> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**

> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**

> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.

# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market

> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.

> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.

# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders

> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**

> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.

5 mistakes new investors make:

1. Learning from the wrong people - Focus on learning from those who are successful/profitable investors, with a long history of outperformance. Read everything written by people like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, learn about finance, economics, business and accounting. 

2. Risk management - Poor or lack of proper risk management protocols and procedures is sure to cause poor, or worse, negative performance. 

3. Investing emotionally - Investing requires complete emotional detachment and objective, logical and rational thinking.

4. Unrealistic expectations - The top investors make between 19% - 35% compounding annually over periods of 30-50 years. If you think you can beat those records, for the most part you’re delusional. 

5. Not knowing what you are buying - Focus within your circle of competence and make sure you have a deep and thorough understanding of what you own. Do your research.",215,stocks

515,What do analyst recommendations really mean?,,677,gh1pe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gh1pe7/what_do_analyst_recommendations_really_mean/,1589118099.0,"Often I see people either taking analyst recommendations seriously, or saying that Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of idiots. Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it’s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here’s how Wallstreet actually works:

Most research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn’t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? 

Let’s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities – these include both equity and debt financing deals – when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.

So as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&A teams can get deals that make the bank money. 

If we take an example – some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla’s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it’s not because they are stupid. No, it’s not because they can’t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet – they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company’s good graces. It’s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. 

This is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don’t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn’t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required – you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. 

The same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions – cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak – here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak – think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&A activity is going on – guys that may be purchased by said acquirers – Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!

Of course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can’t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn’t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the “suckers” (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can’t make money out of a company, they don’t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  

**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don’t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**",94,stocks

Global automakers have begun to gradually resume operations factories after curbs on public movement prevented workers in many countries from commuting. But they face weak demand as job losses and concern about an economic downturn weigh on consumer spending.

“The coronavirus has dealt us a bigger shock than the 2008 global financial crisis,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a live-streamed media briefing.

“We anticipate a big drop in sales volumes, but despite that, we are expecting to remain in the black. We hope to become a leader of the country’s economic recovery.”

Toyota forecast an operating profit of 500 billion yen ($4.66 billion) for the year through March 2021, down 80% from 2.44 trillion yen in the year just ended. That would be its weakest profit since the 2011/12 financial year.

525,NIO Manufacturing TL;DR (with currencies translated to USD),,645,jmh8vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmh8vh/nio_manufacturing_tldr_with_currencies_translated/,1604292238.0,"Hey all, 

Read through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: 

> We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.

---

> The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.

---

> **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**

---

> In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.

---

Risk catalysts mentioned: 

> Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.

*(In English: The trade war between the West and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*

---

> Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.

*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*

---

> We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.

*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* 

---

> Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques

*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*

Some outside data to look at: 

[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)

*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* 

[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)

*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* 

[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)

*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*

[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)

*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*

My personal outlook: 

I'm getting a lot of comments assuming that I'm bearish on NIO. Overall I'm neutral but hopeful that there is more to come once they move past their growth phase. Here is what I think they need to focus on to achieve Tesla levels of growth: 

* Achieve vertical integration to lower cost of goods sold as much as possible 

* Focus primarily on R&D investments (management has been doing that!) 

* Don't focus on international expansion. That can wait until after they've established a steady footing financially and have achieved a significant market share in China. Right now international expansion is too expensive and risky given they are still in a growth phase and cannot be 100% confident in the numbers from the factory or the sentiment from customers. 

* Make sure Tesla does not succeed in China. It currently has a factory and is working on fighting NIO for market share. If Tesla wins NIO will remain a smaller competitor and not achieve nearly as much growth as people are hoping for. I see a lot of people banking on them monopolizing the EV market in China. That is a naive assumption at this time and it is still anyone's guess as to who will come out on top once the dust has settled. 

* Pray for tax incentives. Tesla did so well in the states because the fed and state authorities gave tons and tons of tax credits for renewable energy investments and made it very attractive to buy electric vehicles. Right now China is on track to reduce these incentives which as I mentioned above will hurt NIO's bottom line. If green energy credits can be expanded upon within China it will make NIO's products much more attractive and the production of them financially feasible for NIO given their current state.

We will see how all of this plays out over the coming week as several important make-or-break announcements will be coming out regarding the company that can very well decide if it is the next Tesla or not.",157,stocks

This reminds me of a terrific story of Bob, the worlds worst timer of investing. 


Story here:
https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/


For those that are busy, here are the lessons from Bob’s story:


If you are going to make investment mistakes, make sure you are biased towards optimism and not pessimism. Long-term thinking has been rewarded in the past and unless you think the world or innovation is coming to an end it should be rewarded in the future. As Winston Churchill once said, “I am an optimist.  It does not seem too much use being anything else.”



Losses are part of the deal when investing in stocks.  How you react to those losses is one of the biggest determinants of your investment performance.



Saving more, thinking long-term and allowing compound interest to work in your favor are your biggest accelerants for building wealth. These factors have nothing to do with picking stocks or a complex investment strategy. Get these big things right and any disciplined investment strategy should do the trick.",193,stocks
527,Musk to Tesla employees: 'Our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!' if we don't control costs,News,641,k4uytz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4uytz/musk_to_tesla_employees_our_stock_will/,1606859277.0,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to employees Tuesday warning they will have to control costs in order to maintain the company's streak of narrow quarterly profits.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Tesla shares continue to trade at all-time highs, and the stock will join the S&P 500 later this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees on Tuesday warning them that they need to control their spending in order to continue squeaking out quarterly profits, even though shares of Tesla are trading at all-time highs ahead of the company's inclusion in the S&P 500.

This year, among other things, Tesla began spending to build a new factory near Austin, Texas, and another near Berlin. The company also embarked on a makeover of its paint facilities, which are part of its U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Electric vehicle news site Electrek previously reported the contents of Musk's email.

In early 2020, amid sluggish auto sales the world over, Tesla cut some employees' pay temporarily, slashed contracts with temporary workers and fired an undisclosed number of workers after an annual performance review process. It has since rehired contractors and restored employee pay.

The Tuesday e-mail echoes previous statements by Musk but does not specify how Tesla plans to mind its budget.

On the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts and shareholders, ""We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.""

But on that same call, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla plans to ramp up its capital expenditures by $2 billion versus its prior stated plans to $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. Among other things, he said, the increased spending would enable Tesla to ""in-source"" things like some of its battery cell manufacturing.

Tesla raised $5 billion in September through an equity raise but needs to pay down about $1 billion in this, its fourth, quarter related to converts.

Shares of Tesla were trading above $580 ahead of the market's close on Tuesday.

Some news about  DKNG, PENN and other stock market news for today.**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! First of all, I wanted to wish to everyone happiness, peace and prosperity this upcoming Christmas, hope you are all doing well, Merry Christmas everyone.

And let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/syhtLB9) leading the way, finishing up .38%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4bcpsq) also barely finishing in the green for the day up .07% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XtPLRkZ) finishing in the red .29%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/1MHj5jB) dropping again today by 3.8% despite being even lower but seeing a pop in the last hours of trading with a spike of more than 4% with more uncertainty being created in the Congress after Trump [vetoed](https://ibb.co/7RpRq4W) the defense bill, as he continued to distract the attention from the big number of [pardons](https://ibb.co/pn5ZGcn) he keeps giving out, with the latest round bringing the total to almost 50 in the past week.

More than 60% of the companies were gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/wB1W5gZ) with over 200 new highs, but the volume was relatively low in this shortened trading week, as 8 of the 11 SP [sectors](https://ibb.co/tDMkjKc) were gaining yesterday with Energy and Financials gaining more than 1.6% with Financials gaining a boost as the [Treasury](https://ibb.co/XFcwxzV) yields pushed up and the curve continues to steepen, while the laggards were Real Estate, Technology and Utilities as value plays especially small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/J3LB8fZ), with the large-cap growth companies finishing the day down by more than half a percent.

You can see this exact thing in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/QJ78SkH) as the 3 biggest companies in the world, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft, finished the day down more than 0.6%. You can also see that most of the gains were concentrated in the banks and oil & gas industry while the rest of the market was pretty much mixed with companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook having small gains, while others like Zoom, Netflix, Airbnb and many more suffered.

Yesterday we also got the AAII [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/phzNq0d) that shows how investors were feeling last week. This time we don’t get any good news as this is a contrarian indicator, as people started to move from a bearish sentiment to a more neutral sentiment with more than 4% of investors moving from a bearish view to a neutral view, with only a .1% increase in bullish investors last week, as the stimulus bill seemed to be finally agreed on before Trump making new headlines this week again with the Veto of the NDAA.

Meanwhile we also got tons of economic data yesterday starting with initial and continuing [jobless](https://ibb.co/bg8K6Dt) claims as initial claims came in way [lower](https://ibb.co/n81QxT6) than expected just over 800K, down almost 90K from the previous week and falling to a 3-week low, with the continuing jobless claims also dropping to 5.3M, lower than last week and what was expected from the analysts.

We also saw the durable goods [number](https://ibb.co/DYN5hkb) coming in better than expected with a .9% increase, up for the 7th straight month, while house [PRICES](https://ibb.co/DKms26p) rose nationwide by 1.5% in October from the previous month, which continued to push house prices higher by more than 10% since last year, with home [SALES](https://ibb.co/xhLcYy5) falling in November but are still up over 20% year over year as the median sales price of new houses continued to trend up.

Alongside this we saw the final consumer sentiment read slipping in [December](https://ibb.co/GV1yS3f) to 80.7, lower than expected but higher than the 76.9 in November, with the November Personal [INCOME](https://ibb.co/0QCHRdN) coming worse than expected, losing 1.1% from the previous month.

In contrast, [today](https://ibb.co/74kjcZD) we don’t really get any critical economic data and the stock market closes early.

So, we saw Nikola take another stumble [yesterday](https://ibb.co/319S2TR), after the whole Apple & Tesla [disruption](https://ibb.co/n897DvD) as we saw the stocks drop more than 10% again yesterday and is down more than 26% since I made my prediction and just hit my first price target, here is the link to that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4l6x3/tesla_news_nio_sales_nikola_stock_crash_stock/).

Nikola shares skid [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zhjQhMq) again after another deal for the company fell, as that meant the termination of the deal with Republic Services to develop an electric garbage truck for them. The deal was expected to have Nikola produce over 2500 trucks for the company. So, I would trim my sell position on Nikola here, while leaving some for my next target, with that target being a drop in the single digits in the future for the company.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/V3JdsFX), we saw Alibaba shares plummeting again more than 8% on the Hong Kong exchange and more than 7% in pre-market in the US by [now](https://ibb.co/7VXxMCC), after more pressure has been put on the company as the Chinese authorities are continuing to pursue anti-monopolistic investigations on the company while also continuing the investigation on Ant Group which is an affiliate of Alibaba as they hold more than 1/3 of the company. I think these investigations are very likely to come out with fines and structural changes on how the company will work with its subsidiaries and affiliates, and that the high flying, record-breaking, Ant Group IPO will likely be postponed for a longer period until they meet regulators requirements as it is expected that Ant Group will be given some guidelines to follow by the [regulators](https://ibb.co/kBm5431). My personal belief is that Alibaba is a great company and it should trade higher than this, but until this whole mess with the authorities clears, anything can happen as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/ssR3Ld6), as the stock has underperformed since Ant Group canceled the IPO, with my long-term price target for Alibaba being 300$, but I wouldn’t go to heavy on this trade right now.

Enough of Alibaba, meanwhile we also saw XL Fleet jumping huge [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MP9XBv2) after the usual short-seller Citron, indicated that there is still more upside for this company.

And one final piece of [news](https://ibb.co/6Zp3qMw) is that Colorado set another record for wagers in November, this is another confirmation of the gambling tailwinds that will skyrocket companies like DraftKings & PENN Gaming higher in the next years.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QvL0MV4) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, while the European Union and UK are finally nearing a deal for [Brexit](https://ibb.co/M9pkZxY), and remember there are only 5 trading sessions left in 2020 with today also being a short-day of trading.

Also, don’t forget this is usually when one of the best 7-day period for gains happens, with an [average](https://ibb.co/QbcDDrh) return of 1.33% and a 77% chance of that happening since 1950. But be careful, not every year is a winner, you can see [here](https://ibb.co/16STGsc) some examples, with 1999 being a very bad year as the dot com bubble approached, with another bad year coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. Hopefully this will be the 5th straight year with a positive return in this period.

536,My Renewable Energy Portfolio Update,,611,j6vu2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6vu2f/my_renewable_energy_portfolio_update/,1602093665.0,"Hi everybody. I made a post last month with some brief information on the renewable stocks that I'm invested in. 

Here's the link to that: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ice312/a_guide_for_those_looking_to_invest_in_renewable/

-----------------------

I'm going to update you all on my portfolio allocation and any important news from the companies. The stocks are listed in order by % of my renewable portfolio.

**NOTE**: I've added to several of my positions and increased my cost basis so my personal % gain might be down in some of these stocks despite drastic price appreciation. 

---------------------

**Tesla** **(TSLA)** : (19% gain from my last post) (654% gain total)

(41% of my renewable portfolio)



----------------------

I'll focus on recent updates from Tesla's solar business because this post is about renewables. First of all, battery day in September announced plans with a future goal of 56% price reductions in Tesla LIO batteries. This applies to Tesla's energy storage business and will make their Powerpack and Megapack the most affordable energy storage solutions in the market. They've also cut prices on their solar panels and solar roof products. 

Tesla is still a strong buy in my opinion. It's incredibly volatile but in the long term I see Tesla being the most valuable company in the world.

------------------------

**SolarEdge** (**SEDG)**: (32% gain from my last post) (88% gain overall)

(12% of my renewable portfolio) 

-------------------

There isn't much recent news from SolarEdge. They continue to dominate the global inverter market and have been given a series of analyst upgrades. The only notable piece of news of late is a $550 private stock offering to raise money for future expansion.

I'm still bullish on SolarEdge and I believe they will be crucial in the renewable future. I added several shares and more than doubled my position in September when the stock price dropped under $200. However, they trade at a premium P/E ratio right now and are overvalued by most traditional metrics. If you are a long term investor I think you'll be rewarded for buying in at these prices but don't be too surprised if there's a stock price correction in the near future. 

------------------------

**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**: (59% gain since my last post) (74% gain overall)

(9.20% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

Canadian Solar also had a private stock offering of $200 million to raise capital recently. They sold a solar project to BluEarth Renewables and are announced another project in Mexico. The big piece of news here is that they are preparing a ""Carve out IPO"" of their Chinese module and systems solutions business. This allows investors in China to own part of this specific subsidiary of CSIQ. It provides Canadian Solar with additional capital to expand in China, which is the world's largest solar market. 

Canadian Solar has also seen industry consolidation towards the top players in module manufacturing, which includes themselves. This is a great trend for their future prospects. I added a ton of CSIQ when their stock price dropped in September. I'll keep adding on any dips.

Yes, Canadian Solar's stock has gone up tremendously in the past month. However, they are still undervalued in my opinion and trade at a measly P/E ratio of under 10. This is another long-term hold for me if you're willing to ride out the volatility.

------------------

**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**: ( 136% gain from my last post)  (182% gain overall) 

(8.3% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

Jinko Solar reported a blowout quarter last week, beating on earnings by 97%. In other news, they are set for an IPO of their subsidiary in China's stock market. This has further increased their stock price and led to additional capital for expansion. Jinko is another company poised to benefit from industry consolidation, specifically in China. They've begun developing projects in Vietnam and Japan, plus they have many more in their pipeline.

Jinko has shot up an absurd amount recently. It seems like every day they're up another 10%. I'm expecting a slight correction in the short term, but you could miss out by not buying at these prices. Overall, I think Jinko has unique access to the Chinese Solar market and will continue to grow their top and bottom lines for their foreseeable future. Because of this, I consider Jinko a long-term buy and hold even at these new prices. They still only trade at a 13 P/E ratio and it seems like the market is finally starting to increase these companies' ratios.

----------------------------

**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**: (41% gain from last post) (83% gain overall)

(7.20% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

Since my last post, Enphase has announced several new projects which investors have reacted positively to. Enphase's microinverters will help power projects in Australia, New Hampshire, Mexico and Minneapolis. Furthermore they are increasing production of their IQ7 inverters in Europe and Australia. This international expansion comes as a big plus, because they have a large market share in the United States, but could use some international diversification. 

Overall, it's been only good news from Enphase which has led to a stock price increase. Inverters are a great way to invest in renewables and Enphase is poised to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the impending solar boom.

------------------------

**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**: (6% gain from last post) (49% gain overall)

(6% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

TPIC gets very little news coverage and there's been no recent news. I'd recommended viewing their investor relations presentation and reading my last post. One of their EV partners who I can't name on here or this post will get removed (rhymes with LurkMorse) has expanded production which will benefit TPIC. Also the wind market has seen increased demand in Q3 which will probably be reflected in TPIC's earnings. 

Everything that I said in my last post still stands. TPIC is exciting to me although the low margins are a bit concerning. I think they are a good pure wind investment and there aren't many out there.

----------------------

**Vestas** **Wind** **(VWDRY)**: (18% gain from last post) (122% gain overall)

(5% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

Vestas has reported a number of wind turbine sales in countries such as India, Russia, China, Poland, USA, Vietnam, Egypt, Netherlands, Greece, Columbia & more since my last post. They continue to be a consistent beast in the wind market.

If you want to diversify into Wind, this is the company to do it. Their share price has gone up over the last year but I don't see that stopping any time soon.

-------------------

**BrookField** **Renewables** **(BEPC)**: (31% gain from last post) (37% gain overall)

(4% of my renewable portfolio)

-----------------------

The only news out of BrookField Renewables recently is a $325 million secondary offering. They are a dividend play and have historically outperformed the market. Read up on my last post and their IR page for more info but I recommend BEPC if you're risk averse and like dividend stocks. 

-------------------------
**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**: (16.40% gain from my last post) (12% gain overall)

(3.90% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

HASI is the only new renewable company that I've bought since my last post. They are a REIT and pay out most of their earnings as dividends. Look up their investor presentation if you're interested but they invest in climate change infrastructure, including the land under renewable energy projects. 

I'm inclined to add to my investment in HASI to diversify a bit. Much like BEPC, HASI holds less risk and great dividends.


------------------

**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**: (5.6% gain from my last post) (33% gain overall)

(3.80% of my portfolio)

---------------------

First Solar also announced a secondary offering to raise capital. Other than that the only news is a new project in Chile. 

First Solar has ran less than the other module manufacturers listed above and remains a dominant player in the U.S. market. I consider them a long term buy and hold at these prices.

------------------------

**SUMMARY**: **155%** **total** **gain** (75% gain excluding Tesla)

We have seen recent stock offerings from several of these companies to raise capital. This to me signals an expectation of increased demand in the future, as this capital will be used to expand production. 

The election and Biden's climate plan is a major factor in why these companies have run so much as of late, but regardless of the election outcome, a renewable energy boom is inevitable. If Trump wins I expect a short-term pullback in several of these companies so look out for that. Either way though these companies are long-term 10 year holds and you shouldn't be concerned with short term swings. Any dip is a buying opportunity unless fundamentals change.

------------------

If you believe that renewables are the future, I highly recommend taking matters into your own hands and investing in these companies or other renewable companies. There are also several great ETFs, TAN is probably my favorite out of these.



**EDIT**: I'll probably make a post breaking down the holdings of the renewable energy ETFs because people seem interested in their differences. Look for that in the next week or so

**EDIT2**: I'm 19 years old with a 10 year investing horizon so all of these are long-term holds for me",209,stocks

The MM probably hired an army of lobbyists to manipulate the decision-makers and people reporting to the white house, telling everybody that GME is going to cause another crash, and this is the last thing a new administration wants. They freaked out, and they probably approved what happened

&#x200B;

* **Are we harming the economy? NO.. We are building it.**

1. GME now has an inflated valuation .. yes. They will use it to expand and acquire smaller businesses and hire people.. Real economical progress
2. They can now pay their debts to creditors
3. Individual investors will use their profits to pay their credit card bills, buy a house, buy something.. The money is inside the market.
4. Individual investors from all over the world will use their profits to invest in other companies that will increase in value and expand.

* **We invest differently, They don't like it**

1. We are young passionate people with our own ideas. We don't share the same investment routine and style of older generations. We invest in a better future.. We invest in clean energy, Electric vehicles. We don't invest in shorting small business and crushing peoples dreams
2. We don't play by the wall street rules. We make our own research and our own analysis. we don't count on the analysis of biased analysts telling us how to invest. They are losing influence and that's why they are fighting us.
3. They benefit from our greed and we also were just benefiting from theirs. They have been making money out of the greed of some of us or sometimes the poor research we do regarding certain investments. We found their greed and we took advantage of it. We are actually doing SEC a favor by exposing the weaknesses of the system.
4. We don't need guidance on how to invest. We are mature people and we know the risk of what we are doing. They allowed retail investors to invest in companies with no products or employees.. some of these companies reached 55Bn in market cap.

538,Investing vs Trading: A reminder of tax implications,Advice,606,i782wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i782wm/investing_vs_trading_a_reminder_of_tax/,1597076900.0,"*TOP EDIT:* This post has gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Due to some critiques posted in this thread, let me preface this post with this statement: Please consult your own personal and trusted tax professional. Don't believe anything you read on the internet without verifying all the information yourself. Tax code in the US is complicated, and this post is primarily US focused. The information in here may be over simplified, but its meant to get people thinking about the implications of various trading activities on their taxable income. Its better to start now thinking about your 2020 tax burden rather than in December when you can't do anything about it.

 = = =

We've seen lots of posts recently from ""new"" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.

Lets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET

Lets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.

Now lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.

But here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.

Now lets do the numbers:

If you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).

Keep all this in perspective when you look to ""take profits"" or ""should I keep holding my stock"".

Also, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?

Be realistic and critical about each move. These ""the stock is down, what should I do?"" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: ""The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own"" </rant>


**Edit:** Based on some of the comments below, I think its important we clarify that America has a graduated tax system: https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/

Effective tax rates for someone making $150,000 a year would be around 20% for federal income tax. Beyond that, I think its also important to know that long term capital gains tax is a graduated system where most people would be at 15% step: 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp

If you're single filing tax payer, and you're making $150,000 a year, then the difference between selling short term and long term is more like 5%. Sell now and realize the gains as income (ie. 20% effective tax rate) or hold and sell later to realize the gains as capital gains (ie. < 15% effective tax rate). The question is, can you reliably put up gains via trading that exceed that 5% buffer. If you cannot, then buy and hold. If you can, then trade!

**Edit2:** In addition to taxes, I think to be a better trader, every person at the end of the year should do a comparison of what every stock they bought/sold would have netted them if they had just bought and held. Obviously, this assumes infinite capital since you can't do any reallocation. But it would be a good exercise! Spend a couple hours calculating how much money you made doing trading, then compare it to if you had just bought a couple of good movement stocks (ie. reliable like AAPL, MSFT, or more volatile like SHOP, SQ, TSLA) and just held them. Replaying trades is important, and understanding the tax implications of each strategy, and then weigh that against how much time and effort it took to trade. If the numbers don't add up, change up your strategy.",184,stocks

542,"AT&T (NYSE: T) - An excellent opportunity for Dividend Investors, or those looking to start.",,605,jcmvep,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jcmvep/att_nyse_t_an_excellent_opportunity_for_dividend/,1602899961.0," 

AT&T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.

**Why this is being posted now & the potential:**

* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.
* At its current price AT&T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.

&#x200B;

Looking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.

**What AT&T has going for it:**

* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.
* Consistent revenue growth.
* Lots and lots of cash on hand.
* They are a leader in the US for 5G.
* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).
* Warner Media and HBO Max

Warner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.

The safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.

**Two big issues:**

* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow too much)
* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)

It could be a good sign that AT&T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.

**Final Comments:**

Please extend this by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.

Thank you for taking the time to read!

EDIT: Thanks to all that posted constructive comments! As several have pointed out, yes, AT&T has underperformed the S&P, it should be avoided if you aren't seeking out a high paying dividend stock.",241,stocks

*****
> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.
*****
> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday’s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.
*****
> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.
*****
> “You could say we’re pricing a garden variety recession,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “We come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.” She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.
*****
> “If [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,” said Calvasina.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.
*****
> “I think we needed to get through this week, in particular — the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close” to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.
*****
> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.
*****
> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.
*****
> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.
*****
> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.
*****
> “If it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,” said Knapp. “In 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.”
*****
> “We see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,” said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. “I think something else we’ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.”
*****
> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed’s policy response that could drive the market.
*****
> “In light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,” Goldman economists wrote.
*****
> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.
*****
> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a “patient” stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.
*****
> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.
*****
> “We’ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies’ balance sheets are in really good shape,” Calvasina said. “I don’t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.”

# Signs Of A Washout?

> The S&P 500 Index’s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.

> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.

> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn’t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market’s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday’s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. “These are truly frightening times,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.”

# The Fastest Bear Market Ever

> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “From major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Markets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.”

> Last, one of Warren Buffett’s most famous quotes is, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.” We’ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning’s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.

# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines

Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.

> First of all yes, this time is different – and yet it’s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market’s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it’s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.

> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It’s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.

# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak

> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday’s have been weaker in bear markets.

> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.

 > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.

# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages

> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**

> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.

# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016

> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.

> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.

# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging

> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**

> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**

> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.

I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.

**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**

|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|
|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

&#x200B;

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.

This is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta & delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**FB - Facebook**

Facebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks.

Break-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).

OR

100x shares

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KR - Kroger**

Kroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.

**Plays on the watch:**

Dec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.

OR

IV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.

&#x200B;

**MSFT - Microsoft**

Classic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.

OR

Buying shares and selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

**NVDA - Nvidia**

I am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.

&#x200B;

**SHOP - Shopify**

Shopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.

&#x200B;

I'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.

Time to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.

&#x200B;

**MONDAY 11AM - UPDATE**

I normally post screenshots, but it's not allowed in this sub-reddit. Here are the positions I've enter.

FB - December 18 $260 put. $600 premium collected.

KR - purchased 500 shares and sold 5 covered calls for Dec 11, $34 strike for $300 premium collected.

MSFT - purchased 100 shares

NVDA - purchased 30 shares

SHOP - purchased 15 shares.

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil output next month to well above 10 million barrels a day, as the kingdom responds aggressively to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia.

The world’s largest oil exporter engaged in an all-out price war on Saturday by slashing pricing for its crude by the most in more than 30 years. State energy giant Saudi Aramco is offering unprecedented discounts in Asia, Europe and the U.S. to entice refiners to use Saudi crude.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia has privately told some market participants it could raise production much higher if needed, even going to a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations. With demand ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak, opening the taps would throw the oil market into chaos.",183,stocks

Stocks accelerated yesterday’s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.

The Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.

Today, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be “difficult” before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi’s spokesperson called “productive”. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. 

The impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said “When the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.” The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting “Go big or go home!!!” for more stimulus. 

In other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday’s session.

In terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that “JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans — $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.”

**Highlights**

* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations. The stock was marginally green at the time of writing, pulled down by the broader market.

561,Warren Buffett might still be right about the airlines,,571,gxtl7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gxtl7g/warren_buffett_might_still_be_right_about_the/,1591459369.0,"*""In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but, in the long run, it is a weighing machine"" -Benjamin Graham*

Warren Buffett has taken some heat recently over his decision to sell all of his airline stocks near their lowest point. Amid investor optimism for the return of ""normal"" travel behavior, airline stock prices took flight, so to speak, as a primary beneficiary of this exuberance. This has every investor with a Pied Piper trading account sitting on his couch thinking he is smarter than perhaps the greatest investor of our time. But is he?

* Warren Buffett is not a short-term swing trader, he is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. He looks at the prospects of a company 20 to 30 years down the road, not 2-3 months
* Airlines represented a significant, but relatively small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Taking a loss on an industry that is in turmoil for the chance to redeploy in another industry with clearer skies ahead is more in line with the investing philosophy that made him a success
* Armchair investors think to themselves, ""Well, people won't stop flying"", I'll buy AAL, UAL, and DAL. While that is certainly true in the broad sense, think about the practical sense. Airlines need to squeeze every dollar out of every flight to remain profitable. Under the ""new normal"", not only might the incredibly important Middle Seat be in jeopardy, but the ridiculously profitable Business Class seat is also going to see massive declines as more and more business is conducted remotely.
* With cash burn rates in the double-digit millions of dollars PER DAY, many major U.S. airlines are only in business due to federal government bailout money -- one of the conditions of which was that they keep paying their employees that are not doing much flying (or revenue generation) these days.
* While it is a near certainty that ""people won't stop flying"", there is no certainty about who will be doing the flying. When the bailout money is gone, the cash is depleted, and the revenues are a fraction of where they need to be, a company goes bankrupt. It is entirely possible that one or even two of the major U.S. airline carriers never get their head above water again. Which ones? (\*Casually glances at American and United\*) I'm not sure, BUT, what I am sure about, is that Warren Buffett has access to way more information about the companies he invests in than you or me.
* Last Thursday, while AAL stock was almost doubling, 14 of its top officers VOLUNTARILY took buyouts to leave the company. Now, ask yourself -- why would anyone in their right mind in a leadership role at a prominent U.S. company with a huge salary and comfy corner office voluntarily leave that company and deny themselves the personal glory of being part of a turnaround story?

**My advice:** Take your profits now and buy yourself something nice -- like stock in a company that actually has massive future growth and profit potential. And do not think that you are smarter than Warren Buffett.

The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.

But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.

Guess the Stock Value

Hint #1-In the last 12 years the share price has never decreased by more than -9.27% (or about $-3.53/share).

Hint #2-In the last 15 years (13/15 times) when adjusted net income went up/down so did the share price. In 2019 Adjusted Net Income went up.

Hint #3-In the last 10 years, when compared to prior year's Revenues (Sales), the share price followed the increase or decrease 50% of the time. Last year revenues increased.

Hint #4- U.S. consumer spending on services, an indicator of telecommunications services sales, rose by 2.2% in October 2019 compared to the same month in 2018. U.S. corporate profits, an indicator of corporate demand for telecommunication services, declined by .8% in the third quarter of 2019 from the year-earlier figure. Total U.S. revenue for telecommunications services increased by .4% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018. Revenue (in current dollars) for the U.S. telecommunications industry is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 3% between 2019 and 2023.

Hint #5-(companies name) total asset turnover ratio, which measures the efficiency with which the assets of the Company are utilized, declined throughout the 2015-2019 period, falling from 3.8 times in 2015 to 3.5 times in 2016, 3.3 times in 2017, 2.9 times in 2018, and 2.7 times in 2019, below the period average figure of 3.2 times.

Hint #6-Last year's share price was $60.56

Hint #7- The value of U.S. nonresidential construction spending, a demand indicator for engineering services used in construction, rose by 2.2% year-to-date in October 2019 compared to the year-earlier figure. Total U.S. manufacturers ‘shipments, an indicator of demand for engineering services used in the manufacturing process, grew by 0.8% year-to-date in October 2019 compared to the same month in 2018.

Hint #8-.In 2019 a Segregation Amendment was added to the ESOP. Segregation of accounts occurs when the company buys all or some of the shares of the accounts of participants that have separated service from the company. The cash is invested in other prudent investments until distribution; Segregation of accounts prevents former employees from sharing in future gains (excluding RET, DTH, DIS, etc.); Segregation of accounts protects former employees from sharing in future losses in the value of the company and provides them with additional diversification.; This strategy is used by many ESOP companies to manage their repurchase obligation, enabling them to purchase the shares of terminated participants at the current fair market value. This approach essentially speeds up the repurchase obligation to the time of segregation; Assuming an increasing stock value, this strategy accelerates your repurchase obligation in the short-term and reduces it in the long-term; Segregation can also free up more shares for allocation.

Hint #9-Total Assets increased from the prior year (2018).

Hint #10-Historically if you go with your gut, 60% of the time, it works, every time!-Ron Burgundy (almost)

PulteGroup’s CEO said the recovery in new home demand “was nothing short of outstanding.”  New home construction jumped 17% and builder confidence rose to pre-pandemic levels after plunging in April. 

PulteGroup’s smaller peer **Meritage Homes** $MTH (trailing PE 10.59) reported a much bigger increase with a 32% jump in orders in the second quarter, 78% increase in net earnings, 20% revenue growth and strong margin improvement.   Steven J. Hilton, $MTH chairman and chief executive officer said “Based on our current forecast, we believe we can generate between $4.0-4.3 billion in home closing revenue for the year, including $1.0-1.1 billion for the third quarter, with home closing gross margins around 21% for the third quarter and full year. We estimate that will translate to approximately $8.75-9.25 of diluted earnings per share for the full year,”. **Thats 36% higher than consensus forecasts.**

**Whirlpool** $WHR (trailing PE 12.03) beat expectations with Q2 EPS of $2.15 (compared to estimates for 96 cents) and sales of $4 billion (estimates $3.6 billion).  Both figures were down year-over-year, but the company pointed to “significant Covid-19 related disruptions.”  CEO Marc Bitzer pointed to decisive actions and the resilence of Whirlpool’s business model while CFO Jim Peters highlighted the “solid cost takeout globally and strong cash flow improvement through disciplined working capital management,”.

**Skechers** $SKX (trailing PE 13.44) reported an earnings beat on Thursday and said “Despite the challenges of the second quarter, we are optimistic about the early-stage recovery we are seeing in much of our business, including... the explosive growth of our e-commerce channel,”.  Remarkably the company was able to grow cash balances by more than $175 million during the quarter through working capital and operating expense management.  As a result net cash accounts for about 20% of Skecher’s valuation.

Finally, with **eBay** (2020f PE 15.70) $EBAY due to report Q2 results on Monday,  A Barron’s article said the stock was a buy with analysts (such as Edward Yruma  at KeyBanc Capital Markets) expecting 23% to 26% growth as new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options providing long-term tailwinds for the business. ” Yruma thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth “as it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.” That means, primarily, that marketplace participants are increasingly realizing the importance of selling on multiple platforms.  Trading on just 16x current year estimates, the valuation does look attractive.

Microsoft’s primacy and ubiquity in portfolios reflects the way it exemplifies nearly every characteristic that today’s market is rewarding richly.

Microsoft enjoys mid-30s percent profit margins, has repeatedly reloaded a $40 billion buyback plan and pays out more than $15 billion a year in dividends.

Microsoft is among the top 10 holdings in the most hedge funds, according to Goldman Sachs.

# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**
*****
> Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.
*****
> Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.
*****
> Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.
*****
> Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.
*****
> # Home sweet home
> “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”
*****
> Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.
*****
> Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
*****
> “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”
*****
> # Solvency concerns
> The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.
*****
> “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.
*****
> “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.
*****
> The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”
*****
> Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.
*****
> “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.
*****
> But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.
*****
> “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.
*****
> # Range bound
> For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.
*****
> “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.
*****
> “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.
*****
> “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”
*****
> He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.
*****
> “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.

# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story

> Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.

> The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”

> For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.

> While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.

*****

# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?

> As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.

> “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”

> So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:

> * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.
> * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.
> * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.

> Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.

# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine

> Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.

> “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.

# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower

> Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.

> Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.

# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves

> The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**

> While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**

> One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, ""During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?"" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.

# Investors Remain On Guard

> In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.

> The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&P 500.

> While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",21,stocks
602,"Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC",,515,it7nbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/it7nbn/packaging_deep_dive_the_new_battleground_between/,1600172442.0," This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

With the internet assuming a crash is coming, I am going to be hoarding value stocks that I wish I bought during the crash months ago.

My goal is to make enough weekly off of covered calls to live off of, I would need to net $2,000/wk off of premiums to feel comfortable enough quitting my job, and I would wait for the market to be more stable before doing so.

This past week I net 

$259 off RCL

$125 off AMD

I definitely want to get 100 NKLA. I understand the company is likely a sham, but their call premiums are absolutely insane percentage wise and if a market crash IS going to happen, I want to hoard NKLA weekly premiums on the way down to fund buying other stocks.

I plan on buying 100 DIS, 100 BA, 100 MSFT, 100 APPL, 100 TSLA (if it drops to $400/share again.)

What are some other solid companies that I should invest in long term which have decent call premiums and/or dividends?

In September 2007 Greenspan said ""We have a bubble in housing"" and Jim Cramer warned people on The Today Show to not dare buy a house because you will definitely lose money.  So it's safe to say the public knew there was a housing crisis. 

In October however the Dow Jones hit a historic high of over 14,000. So the Dow had risen 12% from Feb to Sept 07 even though more and more people knew we were in a recession. 

From October 2017 it took the Dow one year and five months to reach it's lowest point during the crisis of aprox 6,600 in March 2009. Decreasing over 50% in that timespan.

What’s the latest news in the stock market? This week earnings reports & more**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple & Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH & AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

611,Manual on reading financials,Advice,494,g4tw2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g4tw2a/manual_on_reading_financials/,1587393288.0,"After my last few big posts, I noticed a lot of you want to learn financials, so I'll share my way of working and reading financials. There are way more ways to read companies, but I think this is a decent, bit extensive way to read basics. 

You can choose how far you want to dig into financials, however it's beneficial to consider all measures. It gives you the best understanding of companies and the difference amongst the industries. 

**BALANCE SHEET**

Assets to liabilities is the most important part. It should be x1.5 at least to be safe, however there are exceptions. Banks for example will operate around x1.1-1.2, while Biotech exceeds x3-4 easily for most of them. 

Next up is cash and long term debt. I'm working with tech companies the most and cash has to exceed long term debt before I add them to my watchlist. Extra points for those who can exceed all liabilities as well. This is again highly depending on industry. You can't expect those measures from companies working with estate, loans, etc. 

Similar to these measure are cash-to-debt and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. Speaks for itself, cash-to-debt exceeding 1 is very good, debt-to-EBITDA below 1 is very good. EBITDA means earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

**INCOME / PROFITABILITY**

Looking at revenue and expense. You can go back as far as you like. I personally don't look beyond 5 years. With these numbers, I calculate profit margin and revenue/expense growth.

Profit margin is depending on industry and growth. If a company isn't making money, doesn't mean it's bad. Great companies like Tesla aren't profitable yet, but will be soon. The most important part is the balance sheet to be financially healthy. 

When looking at revenue/expense growth, I like to compare percentage over 3 and 5 years. That way you'll see if a company is growing faster or slowing down in the last years. It isn't an important measure, but I'll look at it when deciding between multiple great companies.

**VALUE**

To calculate value, the most common way is to look at PE ratio. You take share price divided by earnings per share (EPS). 20 PE is seen as standard fair value, however it's heavily depending on growth and industry. It's important to look at industry average as well. For example, the Oil & Gas industry is more conservative and has an average of only 8.33. Industries with more growth potential will go over 20. 

To get a better view on growth value of a company, we look at PEG ratio. You take PE ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. In general, 1 is taken as ""fair future value"". Like PE, this is also depending on industry average, so check this as well. To give an example, RTX has 1.56 PEG. This wouldn't be ideal, however Defense industry average is 1.75, therefore a good value buy. 

**DIVIDEND**

Of course you look at dividend yield first. It's the yearly amount you get per share when they pay out dividends. Most of the time, it's a counter to growth. Industries like Real Estate have an average of 6.84%, but you won't see your shares grow as they do in let's say the Tech industry. You can ask yourself whether you value growth share gains more than stable dividend income. Be cautious in times like these, cause a lot of companies will cut their dividends to pay debts. 

Nice to look at as well is payout ratio. That's the percentage on how much the company is paying dividend from their profit. Let's say a company has an 0.1 payout ratio, meaning it's holding out on 90% of their profit. They could invest it again to grow, keep it in cash to increase financial stability or you could look at it like there's a lot of room for that dividend to grow over the years. 

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Definitely read about your companies as well. Financials are important, but also know what your company is working on. Where are they expanding, are they working on something new that would get your share up in the future, was there any negative news about them,...

615,The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies,Discussion,482,f1o73u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f1o73u/the_goat_hedge_fund_renaissance_technologies/,1581328649.0,"Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average annual gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average annual net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus’ was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",150,stocks

Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.

We saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small & mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors & drug manufacturers.

[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don’t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.

In some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.

Moving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more & more with Amazon in the online retail business.

In the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.

We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ’s vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer & Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

Also, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer’s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.

And in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it’s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.

And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It’s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.

618,How to Actively Trade Around Earnings,Advice,487,giof04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/giof04/how_to_actively_trade_around_earnings/,1589330838.0,"It’s earnings season and with that we’ve seen an influx of earnings related posts. Over the course of my 10 years of investing and trading I learned a few things about trading during earnings season. In this post I’m going to attempt to outline how to approach earnings and profit off of this season. Unlike most of my posts about long-term investing, this will be the rare active trading post.

For starters, let’s cover the basics of what quarterly earnings are. Publicly traded companies report earnings four times a year, and while most companies follow the calendar year for their fiscal year, some (such as Disney and Microsoft) use a different fiscal year. You may see Q2 earnings in April, or Q1 in October. The important thing to understand is, for the most part, the actual quarter is irrelevant. Prior to an earnings report from being released analysts will use advanced modelling techniques to predict a company’s EPS. Companies are then judged on whether they hit these predictions. The stock price can often fluctuate greatly on whether they hit or missed the consensus prediction.

Now that we understand what earnings are, how do we profit during the volatile earnings season? Let’s outline different strategies and how to implement them

1. The most consistent way to trade around earnings season is the simplest. **Don’t trade!** Earnings season brings additional volatility and often causes emotional trading. Emotional trading can lead to massive losses. Bottom line, if you’re an emotional trader, don’t trade around earnings.
2. The best way to profit during earnings season from my experience is by missing the largest move. In other words, never hold a position, whether it’s a long, short, or options position through earnings. Trade the volatility and hype leading up to earnings and lock in your profits before the report. After the earnings trade the momentum. Don’t be afraid to go long leading up to earnings and shorting after a miss.
3. The final strategy is holding a position through earnings. This is the riskiest option since a miss (if you’re long) or a hit (if you’re short) can cause massive losses. While this is a strategy I rarely implement, you can still be profitable if you approach it in the right way. If you plan to hold through earnings look for companies where the analysts have historically been wrong on earnings. Additionally, look at the individual analyst predictions and remember a hit/miss is based off their consensus. For example, if you have 3 analyst predictions and two predict a 5c EPS and one predicts a -1c EPS the consensus will be 3c EPS, you may be able to conclude that the company is likely to hit since one analyst low balled earnings. You can also read up on how accurate each analyst is and use that knowledge in your trading strategies. This is typically a bit challenging and requires a good amount of digging which is a key reason why I rarely employ this strategy personally.

These three basic approaches are far from all-encompassing but they cover the basics for newer traders. If you’ve just started trading during the COVID-19 pandemic it’s likely wise to avoid the 3rd option listed above. These are not normal times and volatility is already higher than normal.

Good luck trading around earnings and remember to take your profits and cut your losses quickly.",75,stocks

I'd hope that no one in their right mind would listen to this shit but there is a [massive audience on Tiktok](https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343613688767422464?s=20) that this sort of misinformation is targeted at, ie. GenZ/young investors that may only know of the stock market as of 2020. From the article I posted at the beginning on these tiktok investors:

> “You’ve only been investing since April and have only seen a bull market since then,” they added. “Because you’re talking about money, you have hundreds of thousands following you because everyone wants to make money. You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”
> 
> Take, for example, @kriskrohn. Kris Krohn is a Gary Vee-style motivational speaker who offers mentorships on real estate investing.
> 
> On TikTok, he recommends that followers forgo investing via a 401(k), calling the accounts, “fake funny money,” that you “can’t use” and “can’t invest.” Instead, he advocates that his 250,000 followers invest in real estate.
> 
> Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.

If these financial moguls were so filthy rich from their investments, why are they *selling* a class for a fee? They could easily make exponentially more by simply using their secret strategies and investing more rather than spend their time getting $20 from a teenager on tiktok...unless that's how they actually make money??

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week’s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180 degree turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that “getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details”. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, “I would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.” Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery.

626,Stock Market News Today | APHA & TLRY Merge | APPLE Rises | Stimulus & FED Meeting Today [12-16],News,463,ke9cw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ke9cw9/stock_market_news_today_apha_tlry_merge_apple/,1608126048.0,"**What is the latest news in the stock market? Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

With the incredible rise of TSLA, I think we are at risk for a similar phenomenon with EV startups. It seems like everyone and their dog has an EV company right now. If you have a website and a flashy design concept, there is a lot of money to be made with investor cash.

**I am not saying don't invest in these startups, but there are a few things to keep in mind:**

* It's incredibly difficult and capital-intensive to start a car company. History is littered with failures in this industry (See Fisker, Faraday Future, Delorean, etc.).
* Elon Musk is a savvy businessman, shrewd technologist, and a master of publicity. He is the exception among startup CEOs, not the rule. He built Tesla with a diligent plan; and even then barely made it at times (See original roadster launch issues, Model 3 production issues). He is Tesla's greatest asset and we shouldn't assume that his success can be easily replicated.
* Traditional car companies have been slow to start, but they now realize EVs are the future and are starting to come out with their own models. While EV technology may be new to them, they have a huge advantage in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and expertise that will make it even harder for EV startups to gain foothold in the market.

The bottom line here is that investors should have realistic expectations about the chance of a new company's success. Investors who missed out on TSLA will be driven by FOMO to throw money at anything with four wheels and a battery. This can attract scammers (See Theranos) who want some of that easy capital. It's smart to be vigilant when there is so much hype around a particular industry.

GME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.

**First Let's Recap**

**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**

Already was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying.

**During Earnings (12/7):**

[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

The conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?

There were two pieces of ""bad news"": ""missed revenue"" and ""shelf offering"" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Revenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Shelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used.

First comment was by Jim Bell: """"However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.""

When asked by William Reuter from BoA. ""OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?""

George Sherman responded: ""No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.""

My thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:

1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover
2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent
3. They truly want to use it as they said

My issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer.

Nonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of ""bad news"". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.

My thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.

**Post Earnings (12/9):**

A war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.

My thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.

\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).

My thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.

**What's Next?**

The moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.

1. Individuals own 9.87%
2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98%
3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 2.44%
4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million
5. Cohen net worth $600 Million

Cohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?

There are two current possibilities:

1. He conducts a hostile takeover.
2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.

Reason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**

Reason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?

I can think of two possibilities:

1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**
2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**

Now, this is interesting.

Reason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.

Reason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 22.29% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock.

My overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.

Notice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a completely different debate.

642,This is how you know if a stock is a buy,,445,fj6f6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fj6f6y/this_is_how_you_know_if_a_stock_is_a_buy/,1584298689.0,"A lot of people buy stocks because it feels right and they think the company will be around for a while.

When you buy a stock you’re buying into the company therefore you want to look at several factors rather than just go with your gut, if you don’t look at the following factors then you’re better off buying mutual funds or index funds such as VOO and QQQ.

Let’s proceed:

1. Pull up the balance sheet for the last quarter, the last year and the last 5 years. Look at 2 categories, assets (money/money making investments)and liabilities (debt/long term expenses)

The total assets should be 2x or more of the total liabilities. The short term assets should also be about 1.5-2x the short term liabilities. If the balance sheet looks good move onto #2, if not move onto the next company.

THIS ALONE CUTS HALF THE STOCKS MOST PEOPLE “FEEL LIKE ARE A GOOD BUY”

2) Ok so you found a company with a good balance sheet, great! Now let’s look at the historical earnings, look at these for the past 10 years. Are the quarterly earnings growing steadily like you want them to be? Or are there huge peaks and valleys showing a more volatile company? Are they trending downwards showing the company is losing money consistently? Or are they flat/slowly growing showing a steady but boring company?

If the historical quarterly earnings over 10 years are steadily growing, that’s what you want. So move onto 3)...

3) now let’s look at the EPS, this is how much you’re paying for the earnings you receive. Lower is generally better, anything over 20PE is considered high. Look at Ford to see an extremely high PE showing an extremely overvalued company, even at $5 a share!

4) Does the company pay a dividend? This means the company pays you money, typically quarterly, to hold their stock. Not always necessary because a lot of high growth tech stocks don’t but you make a ton due to natural growth, but a dividend is nice.

This will get you started. If you don’t do this for every stock you want to buy then you’re just buying stocks based on emotion and what you “think” looks good on a chart, and you will lose money more often than not.

EDIT: I feel the need to say this is NOT a one size fits all, this is just a good way to find out the value of a company. 

Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tesla, etc. do not follow this formula, but this can tell you how to price companies like airlines.",107,stocks

The deal is worth $44.4 million and will focus on powering drug reviews and inspections, according to the report.

Co-founded in 2003 by tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, CEO Alex Karp and others, Palantir provides data analytics software and services to government agencies and large companies. But its government work makes up more than half of its revenue, bringing in $163 million in its latest quarter.

The company said in November recent contracts it received during the third quarter include a $91 million deal with the U.S. Army, a $36 million contract with the National Institutes of Health $36 million and a $300 million renewal with an aerospace customer.

Palantir stock has surged nearly 200% since it went public Sept. 30.

There was a press conference on Friday, where President Trump said a nationwide website was being provided by Google. Google/Alphabet denied all of this with a clarification after the press conference. Now Google is walking it back.

In a series of Tweets today, Google said that:

> We are fully aligned and continue to work with the US Government to contain the spread of COVID-19, inform citizens, and protect the health of our communities. Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. This is in addition to other measures we are taking, including: a Google “home page promotion” to promote greater awareness of simple measures citizens can take to prevent the spread of the disease; Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area; Promoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube; taking measures to protect users from misinformation, including phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation; Rolling out free access to our advanced Hangouts Meet video-conferencing capabilities to all G Suite and G Suite for Education customers globally until 7/01/20; advancing health research and science; and financially supporting global relief efforts.

Initial reactions by Google/Alphabet on Friday indicated that the White House and Google didn't coordinate at all. Now, it appears Google has bended the knee to the President of the United States.

> He thinks he can order a company to do something by suggesting they're already working on it, and shaming them for not having enough done already in a few days, then blaming it all on Google when it doesn't happen.

But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$, and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.

I've only been investing for two years, but it's my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market.

Tesla is worth 254 billion. 
Ford is worth 24.62 billion. 
GM is worth 36.82 billion 

Tesla has 24 billion yearly revenues (trading 10.58x sales) 
Ford has 155 billion yearly revenues 
GM has 137 billion yearly revenues. 

Tesla can dilute their stock by 10% to buy Ford, putting the stock price to just what it OPENED at TODAY.
Tesla can dilute their stock by 15% to buy GM, putting their stock price to what it CLOSED at THURSDAY. 

I know, I know. Tesla is growing exponentially and they MIGHT have 100 billion in revenue in 5 years. That’s still 35% lower than Fords revenue. Tesla is profitable, and Ford isn’t. That needs to be considered in the valuation, putting Tesla at a higher valuation than Ford. But is Tesla really worth 10x Ford, today? That’s highly unlikely. 

Tesla has grown 45% in 5 trading days. It’s highly overbought and their trading higher than 70 RSI on nearly every single chart you can look at. It’s also trading higher than its upper bollinger band. A pull back WILL happen. It might hit 1500 before the pull back, but it might not. The risk/reward is bad on Tesla at the AH price of 1414. It’s highly risky right now. Please do not fall into the FOMO trap. I promise you you WILL NOT MISS OUT if you wait! You will be able to buy in cheaper. I think even bulls and bears can agree on this. 

I’m bullish on Tesla for the long term, but I am currently short right now. It’s just simply overran itself.

670,Let's get a few things straight about masks and this virus (and the manufacturers),,417,fbr5qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fbr5qp/lets_get_a_few_things_straight_about_masks_and/,1583050860.0,"$APT, Alpha Pro Tech 

N95 respirator masks DO HELP 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirator-use-faq.html

""What is an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)?

An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.

What makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?

Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon

N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.""

Here's what's happening. 

1. Hospital staff need these respirator masks A LOT MORE than the average person does. It means the government should have already placed the orders before the virus reaches their  country. The problem right now is extreme demand, not that people are buying ineffective protective equipment.   



2. This virus usually enters via mouth, nose and eyes via droplets from people's mouth and nose while breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing. To realise the maximum effectiveness that the N95 respirators can achieve, you have to wear goggles also. Even glasses will help a bit, unless of course a virus containing droplet reaches your eyes from the side.   



3.  Surgical masks effectiveness is indeed much lower, since they can only stop  large droplets but not smaller ones and they leave gaps from the side.   



4. For the above reasons, the US gov came to an agreement with manufactures to dramatically increase supply of those respirators and possibly other masks. The demand will only get higher, health services alone will need millions upon millions according to the gov's statements about stocking up yesterday.   



5. APT makes their masks profit precisely from N95 respirators which also happen to be higher margin products for them (and I mean even without the price spikes). The announcements they made already about increased orders, concern the N95 respirator masks specifically.    

*** as correctly pointed out by  u/WaxuTutu, technically it is the N95 respirators (not masks) that work as described in the post. The APT N95 is in fact an N95 respirator (basically it means that this is a mask that fits air tight and has a specific filter, but that is the actual description of the product). The text above was edited accordingly.

A bit about me to give context and the reason I’m posting this. I’m 67 years old, former lawyer situated in Monaco. I retired at 50. I’ve invested my money and I’m worth around let’s say $100 mln? I. Honestly don’t know. I’ve got around $60 mln in my portfolio. Mostly ETFs for high liquidity and safety. I’m a strong defender of long term investments. And that’s the reason why I’m posting. People are scared when they see red. I would like to inspire and explain why you shouldn’t be worried about losses. (If you invest long term). And my example is extrem but that might underline how important it is to hold. See I made $20 mln in 2020. So losing even ten million wouldn’t matter to me. In fifteen years I’ll be green. Sure this isn’t quick money but it’s easy and stable. And you can always trade with pocket-money. I wanted to add a picture of my portfolio to give this post a more theatrical vibe but I’m to old to figure that out. Well I guess I’m trying to give an advice, don’t sell if you lose a bit don’t be scared. You will archive gains if you wait long enough. People always talk about becoming a millionaire overnight.

I’m just trying to get some help understanding the macro-economic factors that could lead to this seemingly impossible situation. 

Live Nation is one of the largest live event promoters in the world. They own Ticketmaster and a slew of live event venues across the world. Due to the pandemic, their business has essentially ground to a halt with revenues down over 95% YoY. Despite this, their stock price is currently trading at or above their pre-pandemic levels.

The company has a significant amount of cash on hand at 2.63B with a quarterly burn around 500M. So it is unlikely the company will completely fold unless the pandemic is extended for many years. But still, I don’t understand how the valuation of this company by the market could be so high. Once live events do come back, wouldn’t the company be in a significantly worse financial position than before pandemic because of the huge amount of cash burned? Wouldn’t it make sense for this weaker future position to be priced into the stock now?

There was often some light due diligence, key news which would impact the markets/a particular stock, and some intelligent discussion on equities.

Over the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.

90% of the posts here now are something along the lines of “opinions on TSLA?!” or “AMD is holding up my portfolio” or “is now a good time to buy NIO?”. To my interpretation, this is allowed in the rules but this is really what the pinned Daily Discussion should be used for. There should be a rule enforcing this, and mods should be removing posts which break this rule.

The other 10% of posts at the moment, especially in the last week which has been red, have been along the lines of “stay strong, don’t sell today, take some time out” or “what happened, I left the house, came back an hour later and TSLA is down 1%?!”. Personally after coming through several -7%+ days in March, I just find these irritating. r/stocks always seemed to be about returning long term gains, not worrying about day fluctuations.

I understand that at the moment this sub has a large number of new investors learning the ropes, but there needs to be more structure in my opinion. Arguably the chaos which is going on is likely not helping these new investors to be successful.

TSLA's book value is 6B, revenue is currently negative but it's not important bc it's a very small number compared to their cash.

The fact is that it currently has a market cap of 197B, so if hypothetically their debts disappear they got a book value of 32B, let's add another 20B for their brand so 52B, let's also say that their profit quadruples to 16B instantly, now it's fairly priced or even a bit undervalued if you use discounted cash flow as a method of evaluation.

But I dont think this is such a realistic view, I think Teslas will be widely used in the future and in years it will become a commonly used car not a rare/luxury one, but it's not an instant thing like in my example.

But it's possible that in years they quadruple their sales and so their profit, but that kind of advance is more or less already priced in the current price.

I think if you buy now and hold it for decades (as you should do when you are investing) you will see a profit, but there's not a margin of safety and that cash would be better spent elsewhere where it would have better returns.",382,stocks

They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business. The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Google’s stock price? Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!**

**\~Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what’s the upside for the company! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

So, let’s start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it’s one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued & underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don’t have the growth across all the board like Amazon.

Maybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn’t helped Amazon since September.

On a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.

E-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&M retailers.

I think one of the biggest problems the company has, it’s the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn’t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.

The net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.

This year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small & medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.

Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.

We also saw Amazon’s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.

The company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more & more AI Improvements.

Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS & Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.

I like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable & cheap internet access around the world.

And last but not least, let’s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments & Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising & payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.

Overall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

Firstly, let’s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.

The company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.

Let’s take a look at the last quarter’s results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon’s net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.

For the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.

For the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.

Meanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don’t even matter.

Amazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.

And one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/89jHggN), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I used the trailing Twelve-month EBITA (which means Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization) and assumed a growth starting from of 15% in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10% growth for EBITA in 2025. EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10% so it keeps the pace with the EBITA. I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18%, which is 2% above the last 4 years avg. NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways, the simpler method is current assets – current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash & cash equivalents, market investments, trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable, so this is the formula I used for this DCF. I also implied the same 10% growth for this, as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate. And last but not least I implied a 10% growth for Capital Expenditure as well, which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method, which will show close results to growth approach.

So, this means we have an estimated $584B worth of FCF for a 10% discount rate, which I believe can be even lower for Amazon, but just to be conservative let’s use this 10% rate for the next 5 years. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over $3T by 2025, which is mind blowing. So, let’s do the math, with an estimated diluted share count of 531M, that would mean a stock price of $5732 and would imply a return of 83% by 2025. This are insanely huge numbers so let’s take a look at the EBITDA approach also. The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25, so, with this multiple, the company would only be worth $3200, that would be only a 2.6% gain from where it is now. If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be $4470, with an average return of 43%, which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth. You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company, for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently, so if you use a 50x [multiple](https://ibb.co/VWDxGcg), the actual projections of the stock would be very close, with 71% return for the EBITDA approach and a 77% upside on average, but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach, which is not the DCF method.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.

I implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it’s likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more & more money.

We also have to estimated what the Capex & Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&D & SG&A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.

[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let’s assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.

As I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.

For the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.

So, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it’s trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.

[Compare](https://ibb.co/ChhMP6Z) this to the [DCF](https://ibb.co/1TM7FWd) valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio, while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio, which I don’t expect Amazon to trade at, not even in 5 years.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company… but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers… I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy… but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.

So yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?

The company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn’t overbought and hasn’t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it’s very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.

And let’s take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn’t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street’s analysts expect

So, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced by the end of January.

And I shouldn’t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.

So, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)

""Stonks"" were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one)

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness (and an trainee spot at Deutche Bank's analyst desk). My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. Everybody is a genious in a bull market, put some money in to a company in IT and bam! You had LOL GAINS. Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

&#x200B;

The ""dip"" came. Eli thought ""stonks only go up"" I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.

&#x200B;

So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an idea that I'm using myself.

&#x200B;

1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits
2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This money has had a ridicoulus payback over the years.
3. For every 20% growth I take home 20% of the profit, no matter what. For crazy rockets I might take home more, say half the profit of every 20% growth.

&#x200B;

So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things.

&#x200B;

1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times
2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%)
3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I pay off mortgate, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  Its money. I have money so I can spend it, use it.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story. Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6 months. Its not coming back for a while. Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing Q4's and remember its not money until you sell.

703,Understanding common misconceptions surrounding stock splits,Resources,385,i12p6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i12p6p/understanding_common_misconceptions_surrounding/,1596177215.0,"Welcome to my latest Ted talk!

Every other post seems to be about the announcement from Apple ($AAPL) in regards to their 4-1 stock split. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions around stock splits. In an attempt to help out the community I’m going to answer some of the common questions I’ve been seeing lately.

First off, *what happens when a company splits their stock?*

In the case of $AAPL, the stock is splitting 4-1. On August 31st the shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. If the shares pre-split were trading for $400 a share, post-split they will be trading for $100 a share. The number of shares in circulation as a result will increase by 4x. **This means the companies valuation will not change.**

*What about my options contract?*

The vast majority of time with a conventional split like what we will see with $AAPL, options contracts will be adjusted similar to conventional stock ownership. If you own 1 400c contract, post-split you’ll own 4 100c options. While I don’t expect this outcome, it is also possible for a non-standard options contract instead. Non-standard contracts are common with reverse splits, not very common with this sort of split. 

*What about dividends?*

The dividend yield is expressed as a percentage. 1% (rounding up) will be same regardless if you own 1 share at $400 or 4 shares at $100. 

*Should you buy before the stock split or after?*

While a stock may see increased volatility post-split, investing in a company should be done when you as the investor feel the stock is undervalued. This may be pre-split or post-split based on price action. If you are actively trading you may be able to take a speculative position pre-split with the assumption that post-split there will be increased interest in the stock and thus an increase in share price. There is no guarantee we’ll experience a post-split rally though.

**Bottom Line**

Fundamentally nothing changes with a stock pick. When companies execute stock splits they’re simply reducing the cost and thus the barrier to entry for small time investors.

I have two accounts, one is a brokerage and the other I transferred my 401k into (I have a city retirement fund as I work in public safety). Between the two accounts I have $16,000, evenly split between the two, and I’ve decided I have to sell off most of my brokerage account because I need the money to move out and buy a house. It’s just such a cruddy feeling to sell off a bunch of my stocks, even though I’ve made profits and this is ultimately what I started to invest in for, to make profits and buy myself nice things. 

But in the last year I’ve really become invested (pun intended) to researching companies and investing my money in them, it’s become a hobby for me. This subreddit has really been awesome in learning how to cope with mistakes and how to stay strong and hold out, especially with Covid screwing up the market as much as it has.

# **Stocks are ignoring the lack of a stimulus package from Congress, but that could change  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/stocks-are-ignoring-the-lack-of-a-stimulus-package-from-congress-but-that-could-change.html)**
*****
> Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.
*****
> In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.
*****
> Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
*****
> “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”
*****
> Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.
*****
> Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.
*****
> “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.
*****
> “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.
*****
> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.
*****
> President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.
*****
> “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”
*****
> Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.
*****
> “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.
*****
> He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.
*****
> The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.
*****
> “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.
*****
> “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”

> # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You

> The S&P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.

> From the lows on March 23, the S&P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> After a historic drop in March, the S&P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”

> # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch

> US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**

> The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.

> # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs

> At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.

> Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just released B.I.G. Tips report we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> Today marked 100 trading days since the Nasdaq 100's March 20th COVID Crash closing low. Below is a chart showing the rolling 100-trading day percentage change of the Nasdaq 100 since 1985. The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.

> While the Nasdaq 100 bottomed on Friday, March 20th, the S&P 500 bottomed the following Monday (3/23). This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!

> # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight

> Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.

> While the S&P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/Streaks-Chart.png))**

> Whenever the S&P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.

This individual was wrote to by a company telling him that he could make serious money by doing what he does already, all he has to do is mention a few specific penny stocks to his audience throughout his videos. This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I’m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it’s better to be cautious and always do your own research first. Ultimately, what you do with your money has to be decided by you alone.",87,stocks

DraftKings Casino is also available as a standalone app in PA and NJ, as well as embedded into the DraftKings Sportsbook platform in all three states.

Michigan online casinos will additionally go live either later this year or early in 2021, where DraftKings has a path to market under a tribal partnership.”

According to the latest update on the Illinois Gaming Board website, DraftKings (Crown IL Gaming LLC) applied for a management services license for sports betting on April 28, which may indicate that the company is seeking a quicker way into the Illinois market rather than enduring the waiting period for online-only sports betting platforms.

A DraftKings representative told Sports Handle via email this week that the company doesn’t “have any comment to provide regarding the MSP application/license in the state.”

FanDuel is pursuing a similar strategy via a partnership or purchase of Fairmount Racetrack. For DraftKings, it’s currently unclear who the partner would be, but Harrah’s Joliet, Jumer’s Rock Island, and the Casino Queen have not publicly disclosed who their online partners will be and could be possibilities.”

Is it really so farfetched that we won't ever see 3400 again?  Do we really have that much room for growth to take us past 3400?  This bull market has been driven mainly by stock buybacks and lax taxation laws from our current president.

The sheet lists all the companies from the five main ARK ETF's (ARK K,W,G,F,Q), with multiple data such as live stock prices, live stock return, weight in the portfolios, etc.

In a week that brought the wildest market swings since the financial crisis, Thursday hammered investors with something crazier -- a 10% drop in the Dow, the end of the longest bull market on record and the biggest sell-off since 1987’s Black Monday.

At the end of the day, the S&P 500 smoldered 27% below records set barely three weeks ago and wiped out all its gains since the end of 2018. The news was even worse overseas: Europe’s benchmark index suffered its worst day in history. Brazil’s Ibovespa tumbled as much as 20%, extending this year’s loss to almost 50% in dollar terms. Canada’s main gauge was off more than 12%, its worst day since 1940.",112,stocks
726,"Citron Pulls Plug On NIO, Says Valuation 'Can Never Be Justified' NIO Price Target is $25",,367,jtjdis,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jtjdis/citron_pulls_plug_on_nio_says_valuation_can_never/,1605286555.0,"I’ve posted the Benzinga Article below. I definitely feel like it’s something this sub (especially Nio mooners🚀) could benefit from seeing and discussing. I swear, it’s a 2 minute read: 

————————————
Two years after Citron Research editor and notorious short seller Andrew Left made a bold bullish call on Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), Left said Friday it’s finally time for investors to cash out of the red-hot EV stock.

Back in November 2018, Left compared Nio to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) when Nio was trading at around $7 per share. Today, Nio shares are trading at $53. *($46.70 at the time of this Reddit post)*

“After a rocky road of trading, NIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,” Left wrote Friday.

2 Vulnerabilities: Left said Nio has two major vulnerabilities in the near-term.

Tesla’s Model Y price cuts will apply significant pressure to sales of Nio’s ES6 hatchback model. Last month, Tesla sold nearly twice the number of vehicles in China that Nio sold, and Left is expecting China’s EV market to continue to be an intensely competitive pricing environment.

Left is not a fan of Nio’s share structure.

“While we commend Baillie Gifford (love those people) and early investors, right now we are looking at a share structure and an investor base that is more interested in spinning a casino wheel,” said Left. He also noted Nio's short interest is approaching a two-year low.

What Nio Investors Are Buying: Left said investors buying Nio today should understand what they are getting into.

“Anyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen,” he wrote.

Left said there are better ways to play the China EV story: “It is time for investors to rotate out of NIO, enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology.”

Left's new price target for Nio is $25, suggesting more than 50% downside.

Benzinga’s Take: There’s no question the Chinese EV market will be a major growth story for years to come. But Nio’s market cap has now surpassed Daimler’s despite the fact that Nio sells roughly 5,000 vehicles per month and Daimler sells about 1 million vehicles per month.

*Thoughts?*



Edit: For those asking “WTF is Citron?” Below is what I skimmed from his Wikipedia, but there is a whole ass section about his reports on Chinese companies and what Chinese companies and leaders have taken legal action against him. He’s already banned from trading in Hong Kong for 5 years because of his report on a HK real estate company being insolvent. 
————————————

Left initially started StockLemon.com in 2001 as a self-published blog containing reports on controversial companies. He rebranded the site as Citron Research in 2007.Left researches and short sells companies he believes to be engaged in fraud, have been suspiciously promoted, or have been mistakenly overpriced by the stock market.

According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ.

Citron Research has published reports on 18 Chinese companies, 16 of which experienced a drop in stock prices, with 15 of them experiencing drops of over 70%.[38] This has caused a collective of Chinese business leaders, including Qihoo 360 CEO Zhou Hongyi (a company that has been targeted by Left), to launch a site called CitronFraud.com (no longer operating).[39] Left sent a legal notice to the 60 Chinese executives involved, seeking an apology, and told Tech In Asia that he is consulting with lawyers and considering legal action in response.[40]",239,stocks

I'm pretty new to this, but if you are too and you're anything like me, you've probably seen a lot of people talking about how they've bought 300 shares of this, dropped $2k on that, have six figures in ETFs, etc. I've even seen a couple comments scoffing at people who only have a couple hundred to invest. I dunno about you, but it can get frustrating and disheartening. So I just wanted to take a minute and say: you're doing great just by getting started!

It really doesn't matter how much money you have. Sure, the more you can invest, the more you can (potentially) gain, but any profit is profit. If you want to get into trading like a lot of people do here, it's perfectly okay to start with $100, buy a share or two in something that seems reliable yet cheap, make like $5, sell it, rinse and repeat. You can work your way up to doubling or tripling your initial investment by just buying a good stock on a red day, waiting a few days, and selling when it's in the green by a few dollars. It's not as glamorous or fast as people talking about their $10k gains in a day but it is profit, it can be faster than long-term investing when you're just getting started, and it does allow you more money to play with without having to put in more of your own.

And if you want to start investing long-term, any amount is a great amount. $100 in a savings account might make 0.20% APY, like what my bank offers. $100 in ETFs could get you ~10% annual returns. $10 in a year doesn't sound like much, but it's a massive improvement over 20¢. (And you'll almost definitely put aside more than $100 year to year anyway, but you get the point.)

All in all, any profit is profit, the best amount to trade with is anything you can afford to lose, the best time to start long-term investing is always immediately, and it's perfectly fine if all you're making is a few dollars trading or investing. The important part is that you're getting started, so don't get discouraged! Best of luck to all of us =)


p.s. Also, IMO, short-term trading is okay! As long as you know the risks (yes, even of meme stocks) you can treat this as a game or a casino or whatever you want. Like someone else here said, this is /r/stocks, not /r/investing. At the end of the day it's your money, and sometimes stupid-seeming risks will make way more profit overnight than safe long-term investments will in years, and sometimes you'll lose your life's savings in a day and wish you'd just gone the investing route with $VOO or something. Do whatever you're comfortable with, don't listen to anyone scoffing about what investing has become. (Although, I guess, take what I've said with a grain of salt too! I am probably just as new as you ;b Feel free to correct me on anything as well!)",126,stocks

Stocks traded choppily today, with the market rising throughout the session before nose-diving in the last hour. The benchmarks are now firmly in correction territory, roughly 10% below their record highs at the beginning of the month, erasing the gains from a historic August. Traders are digesting a range of concerns, including uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election, signs of slowdowns in economic growth, dimming hopes for more fiscal stimulus, and worsening trends in Covid-19 cases, particularly in Europe.

After rising in the morning, the major indices cut their gains in the final hour of trading. The S&P finished 0.24% up, the Dow finished 0.17% up, and the Nasdaq finished 0.47% up.

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claim report, which showed that another 870,000 individuals filed new unemployment claims. This is slightly above Wall Street’s estimates but below the 1,000,000 level that’s become a key marker to measure the health of the pandemic-stricken job market. This data shows that jobs are not coming back at the rate that Wall Street would like and that workers are continuing to struggle to secure jobs in our healing economy. 

Chris Rupkey, chief economist for MUFG Union Bank said, “The labor market losses are stunning in that they show there isn't enough work out there yet in the middle of September nine months after the Covid-19 virus shut the economy down. The stock market is falling again over the concerns for the economy as well they should because the high-level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by Federal government officials down in Washington.” 

Unfortunately, hopes for more stimulus are looking increasingly unlikely before the November election Congressional lawmakers are at an impasse over how much fiscal stimulus should be passed and to whom it should be directed. And more recently with the tragic passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Congress’ focus is now on the Supreme Court.
