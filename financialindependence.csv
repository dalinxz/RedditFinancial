2,FU Money in Practice?,,370,l8rauv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l8rauv/fu_money_in_practice/,1612029346.0,"I am a software developer not yet near FIRE, but I am approaching some semblance of FU money, with a bloated savings account and a decent chunk of change invested in various tax advantaged accounts. This month, I earned a good review at work, and decided I could start to coast a bit more and try to focus more on my mental health. However, my boss had a different plan. Suddenly, I have more pressure than ever to deliver multiple projects yesterday, and am at a loss for how to respond.

How do you use your FU money in practice? In my experience, at least 50% of bosses want to push their employees to give their jobs 110%. I always imagined when I got to this point that I would be able to coast with a more comfortable 80%-90% effort, but it seems most bosses put pressure on their employees to be as productive as humanely possible by any means necessary. The pressure has really started to affect me and I have considered quitting, but since quitting would delay my FIRE date, I would prefer to keep my job with a slightly reduced workload. I also have some fairly specialized skills on our team, which has resulted in me being the only person on our team able to deliver certain projects. I thought this would be good leverage too, but I'm not sure my non-technical boss will truly appreciate this fact until I'm gone.

How do you utilize your FU money to make yourself more comfortable at work, without setting yourself up to get additional pressure from your boss or labeled as an underachiever/candidate for the chopping block?",financialindependence

Every so often someone would post here some article or column about how the fact that ""everyone is moving into index investing and how that would kill the market"", as there would be no untapped value stocks and no opportunity for growth .  There would be long discussions why this was or was not the case that would drag for days. Do you guys remember that?

6,Space in a conservative FIRE portfolio for high risk investments?,,73,l786dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l786dq/space_in_a_conservative_fire_portfolio_for_high/,1611866535.0,"I've been following the FIRE mindset fairly conservatively, building my portfolio largely with index funds and, indeed, that has served me very well. In the past few years, I've also branched out into real estate syndicates, but even then I only pull the trigger on the deals that seem like pretty safe bets. As a result, I haven't lost any money on any of them (not even during this pandemic) but I also don't see the huge returns. After all, risk and return tend to be pretty closely tied.

Lately, though, I've been wondering if I should have a portion of my portfolio dedicated to very high risk investments that have the possibility of mega returns. These might be ""win big or lose everything"" style deals. The deal that really triggered this thought process was one where I _could_ make a staggering return but could just as easily wipe out my principal. I would normally not even give such a ""lottery style"" investment a second glance... but should I?

These Wall Street Bets fights with the hedge funds is another example. The idea of investing in a meme stock would normally be ludicrous to me, but I'm no longer so certain it should be.

For the record, I have already surpassed my original FIRE target of $1.5M (just passed $2.1M last month) if that matters.

What about you? Do you have a portion of your portfolio allocated to hail mary bets? If so, what's your rationale behind how much?",financialindependence

Didn't get to posting until today because I was too busy doing whatever the fuck I want.

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!",financialindependence

12,FIRE & Health-insurance across state lines,,7,l5g4kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l5g4kt/fire_healthinsurance_across_state_lines/,1611674563.0,"Similar to this thread, but more specific [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how\_does\_fire\_work\_w\_end\_of\_life\_and\_health/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how_does_fire_work_w_end_of_life_and_health/)

I have a great set of doctors (primary & specialists) in a city that is known for great healthcare & medical research.

Even though I've moved for work long ago, I've kept those doctors, and my workplace EPO & PPO plans cover them as all big insurances (Blue Cross, Aetna, UNH, Cigna) have nationwide networks.

However, ACA plans don't have nationwide access.

Are you maintaining primary residence in the States where their doctors are, for the sake of getting ACA coverage there?

Or are you  buying insurance in private market from one of the big companies and forgoing ACA? Which would also mean no-subsidy if you'd otherwise qualify",financialindependence
13,How does FIRE work w End of Life and Health Expenses?,,38,l55nmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l55nmf/how_does_fire_work_w_end_of_life_and_health/,1611633536.0,"tl/dr: how can you fire at anything less than 60k/yr w health care costs being what they are?

Since healthcare is, typically, an ever-increasing cost in USA, the older you get, how is this calculated into  typical I need $XXK/year FIRE formula? 

Before Medicare even kicks in, if you're now FIRED and no longer on an employer's insurance plan I'm guessing you're now buying an individual plan?

Let's say your annual premium as a 50 y.o. is 6K/year with a $6K deductible; before anything gets covered by health insurance. (And, God forbid, you get diagnosed with a serious illness in October then, of course, your deductible gets set right back to $0 in January.)

And if you get dementia, etc., when you're older than 50, say when your 75, Medicare will not pay for long-term health care. Long-term health insurance is incredibly expensive *if* a policy will even be written out for you and if it even covers beyond five years. Let's assume $3500/year/long-term health care premium, starting at age 65, for one person only. And say that policy coverage is only good for 5 years, which is typical, afterwards you could easily be spending$3-6K/month on care, out of pocket.

Is my thinking wildly off-base? I don't see how one is financially independent with a potential $6-12K/annual cost of health care and then the added possibility or overlap of long-term health care at, say, a FIRE of <60K/year. 

Help me understand. Are you planning on cashing out of your home and living in a senior community 1bedroom when your >50?",financialindependence
14,Interpreting Guyton-Klinger SWR,,32,l534iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l534iv/interpreting_guytonklinger_swr/,1611625160.0,"Hi, FIRE. I've been trying to wrap my head around the Guyton-Klinger rules for withdrawals in retirement. For anyone not familiar, Guyton-Klinger is a method for adjusting your withdrawals in retirement according to the behavior of the market. It seems like a lot of people aim for the 4% rule in retirement but plan to cut back their spending during bear markets. Guyton-Klinger will systematize that strategy and also tell you the maximum you can safely spend every year while delivering a higher probability that your portfolio will outlive you than the 4% rule can deliver. 

Specifically, this passage has been giving me trouble:

 ""The portfolio management rule (PMR) determines the source(s) of each year's withdrawal.

* Following years where an asset class has a positive return that produced a weighting exceeding its target allocation, the excess allocation is sold and the proceeds invested in cash to meet future withdrawal requirements. 
* Portfolio withdrawals are funded in the following order: (1) overweighting in equity asset classes from the prior year-end, (2) overweighting in fixed income from the prior year-end, (3) cash, (4) withdrawals from remaining fixed-income assets, (5) withdrawals from remaining equity assets in order of the prior year's performance. 
* No withdrawals are taken from any equity following a year with a negative return if cash or fixed income assets are sufficient to fund the required withdrawal.""

Some of this seems redundant unless I'm misunderstanding something. Is it just poorly written? My interpretation is this:

* Always sell excess weighting of stocks/bonds if there was also a positive return. Use resulting cash for current and future withdrawals as needed.
* If sales from overweighting of stocks/bonds and cash reserve are insufficient to meet requirement for current withdrawal, sell bonds first and then stocks in order of best to worst-performing until requirement for withdrawal is met.

I'm trying to automate Guyton-Klinger in a spreadsheet and I think if I can get the Portfolio Management Rules (PMR) nice and clear I'll be able to finish it shortly. Help me out and I'd be happy to share the finished spreadsheet.

It’s helped me achieve financial stability and growth while truly enjoying life (something that can be hard when aiming for a super high savings rate). 

Things I spend on without beating myself up: travel, tattoos, yoga, my partner, my cat, and renting a decent place for myself. These things bring me legitimate joy. 

Things I mercilessly cut spending on: clothes, restaurants/bars, furniture, cars, and new tech/devices. These things don’t really affect my happiness. 

You may have completely different priorities than 
me, and that’s great! My point is just to make it clear what you care about, and allow yourself to direct money that way. Even though I spend on things I love, my monthly spending has taken a nosedive by saving on things I don’t care about.

Much love to you all!

Edit: Wow thank you for the love and awards on my first-ever Reddit post. As many of you pointed out, the quote is from Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich. I also wanted to clarify that “extravagant” doesn’t necessarily mean “luxury.” When I say I spend extravagantly on things, I still do so responsibly.

24,More money more happiness?,,40,l29p68,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l29p68/more_money_more_happiness/,1611268832.0,"Long time lurker but wanted to share a recent study I came across. Thought it would be interesting to hear the FI crowd’s take on it. 

A recent study by Matt Killingsworth seem to contradict the previous study showing that money matters less for happiness after $75,000. Killingsworth’s study shows increased experienced well-being at higher income levels after studying 33,391 employed participants. 

“The results of the new study, however, reveal that rising income continues to affect the earner’s well-being even into the hundreds of thousands of dollars”

“Killingsworth finds one of the main links between money and increasing happiness is the flexibility a higher income gives people.”

Does this impact your FIRE date? For me, I think focusing on balance and aiming for a slightly higher $ value would help increase my ‘experienced well-being’.

25,How would you handle inflation during retirement? Can 6% inflation decimate your balanced portfolio?,,32,l26wwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l26wwi/how_would_you_handle_inflation_during_retirement/,1611260703.0,"I recently FIRED at 45 with 3.5M, not including my personal residence (1M). My annual spending ranges from about 75 to 80K.  Therefore, my low SWR of 2.3% should last according to the 4 % rule and other popular studies, (e.g. a 3% SWR should never deplete). However higher inflation could still wreak havoc on your nest egg and increases the likelihood of portfolio failure. 

So I'll be using my own numbers to illustrate this example using FireCalc.

For Early Retirees, the typical advice is to maintain a high equity allocation in the portfolio to offset higher inflationary periods. I don't disagree, but this seems to work well for moderate inflation of 3 to 5% but really starts falling apart when inflation reaches 6% and beyond as we have seen in the past. 

&#x200B;

* At 5% inflation FIRECalc found that 3 cycles failed, for a success rate of 96.8% (100% equities)
* At 6% inflation  FIRECalc found that 20 cycles failed, for a success rate of 78.9% (100% equities)
* at 7% inflation FIRECalc found that 35 cycles failed, for a success rate of 63.2%(100% equities)
* at 8% inflation FIRECalc found that 54 cycles failed, for a success rate of 43.2%  (100% equities)

Furthermore, the negative effects are ""magnified"" if **bonds** are used in the portfolio. The success rates would be even lower. For example at 6% inflation with a 60/40 balanced portfolio, the success rate drops to **18.9%.** 6% seems high by today's standards but not impossible! Everyone is assuming inflation will stay low for years but no one really knows when rates will start rising and when they do, anyone holding a balanced portfolio will likely feel its negative effects.

Could someone **knowledgeable** in this matter offer some advice about how to handle high and consistent inflation during retirement? 

My initial thoughts about risk management:

* Reduce spending 
* Stay diversified globally, 
* Holding some Real Estate
* Maintain a high asset allocation to equities and learn to live with market volatility/crashes because inflation is as much of a risk.
* Go back to Work if required
* Win the lottery

Assumptions: 

Using  [https://www.firecalc.com/](https://www.firecalc.com/) to simulate possible scenario's I noticed that higher inflation could eventually decimate a well-diversified portfolio even if invested in 100% equities.

Plugging in numbers in Firecalc yields the following:

**\[Start Here Tab\]** 

* Spending: **$80,000**
* Portfolio: **$3,500,000**
* Years: **55**

**\[Other Income Tab\] -**  **Social Security**

As an alternative, my employer offers a nonqualified deferred comp plan structured as a rabbi trust.

The plan and the match is extremely attractive, and while it is not a 401(k) it allows me to defer up to 75% of my income in a year, payable upon retirement over a 10 year period.

Much of the perspective I’ve read has contributions to these plans over and above 401(k) contributions. That is not my case beyond My wife maxing out her 401(k) and putting the maximum into an HSA. 

Is anyone else in a similar position to me, and how have you approached contributions to these plans and for them Into a FI RE strategy? This is a good problem to have, but a problem  nonetheless.

Anyone who can achieve stable employment can, theoretically, achieve FIRE - but most don't.

I just came across this long article on the subject - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/

The author lists 20 ""flaws, biases, and causes of bad behaviour"". Any resonate with you - it certainly made me pat myself on the back a few times, which makes me suspect there's a few here that I'm just currently blind to in my own life!?

1. Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.

2. Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a reward.

3. Rich man in the car paradox. (You don't admire the man, you think people would admire you if you were the man.)

4. A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult, resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding rewards that come from current decisions.

5. Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

6. Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is the lifeblood of progress.

7. The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.

8. Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear terms.

9. Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian thinking to achieve above-average results.

10. An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean rules but loose and unpredictable trends.

11. The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.

12. A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

13. Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally and physically.

14. A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.

15. An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.

16. Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.

17. A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.

18. Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the inherent complexities of everything involving money.

19. Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.

20. The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your future.

tldr from the author: ""If there’s a common denominator in these, it’s a preference for humility, adaptability, long time horizons, and skepticism of popularity around anything involving money. Which can be summed up as: Be prepared to roll with the punches.""",financialindependence

My wife and I rearranged our entire life to hit FI as quickly as possible - Heavy work schedule, plus planning to build NW with BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat).  We are now ~seven years in (out of then-estimated 12 total) and decided to slow down: sold the rental units, paid off the personal mortgage (both financial 'mistakes' I'm very happy with) and am taking a more relaxed, surefire path to FI involving low (but comfortable) expenses, no rentals, and reducing work schedule.  Journey, thoughts, and numbers below.

Journey before destination.

#This is way longer than I intended; it also has all the info in it I enjoy hearing about other people’s FIRE journeys. . . sorry for the length.

###Background (Skip this if you want; I enjoy reading these, so I lay it out for others)

I had terrible money habits growing up: they continued until I was 26.  *Really* bad.  I grew up on foodstamps, and we never had *any* excess money; anything that came in went right back out on expenses.  I’d like to say they were necessities, but looking back. . . I think we could have done a lot better.  The scarcity mindset that living at the financial edge instills is real, and I continued to spend every dollar available to me (by work or by loan) until I stumbled across FIRE.  Constantly racked up credit card debt, and took every dollar that was ever available on student loans.

I regret taking the amount of student loans we did; we could have done less (though not anywhere near zero)  They say “That first 100K is hardest”, but it’s really that “That first 100K from *zero* is hardest” because if you hit a low point of -172,000, compound interest doesn’t really help you for that first 272K. . .

Income/expenses listed are at the end of that calendar year.

* *2011, age 24:*

Graduated in 2011 with a Civil Engineering Degree, wife was a student, working on a Masters in Public Health.  This was the absolute peak of the financial crisis for engineering.  I took a (not quite full time) temp job as a web developer making $20/hr, and we maxed out taking my wife’s student loans:

**Income: 31K me, 0K wife, 31K comb  ||  Exp: ~40K  ||  NW: -$163,000**

* *2012:*

Wife graduated grad school halfway through the year and got a fellowship for $24/hr.  My temp work finished halfway through the year, and I ‘worked’ full-time applying to engineering jobs.  Finally got one after a few hundred resumes, but wouldn’t start until just into the new year, 2013.  Which left that year at:

**Income: 12K me, 26K wife, 38K comb   ||  Expenses: ~40K  ||  NW: -$172,000**

* *2013, age 26: the tipping point year for FIRE*

Note that we *moved significanly backwards* the previous year in net worth due to student loan interest and spending. . .

Started a job as an engineer!  $52k per year ($25/hr).  Straight salary, with a terrible (in retrospect) company.  Worked a *ton* of hours, but only got paid the base salary.  I shudder to think what my hourly rate (working a lot of 70 hour weeks) actually was averaged over this year. . .  Still a financial step up!

**Discovered FIRE.**  I cannot stress enough how big of a change this made for my wife and me.  My wife was naturally a frugal person (I was *not*) but we both had otherwise terrible habits.  Once about my third real check rolled in I googled “Student Loan Repayment” and in the process of trying to find a more robust calculator (I was looking for, essentially, [unbury.us](http://unbury.us), though I didn’t know at that time it existed) and happened to stumble across Mr. Money Mustache in February.

I would like to pause for a minute to point out how terrible of a name this is:  I can credit this one website with legitimately changing my life in a very positive way, but if I ever try to explain what this life-altering blog was, it’s. . . mister money mustache.  Sigh.

I was consumed.  In less than a month I had read everything (and I mean *everything*) on MMM, MadFientist, and JL Collins; I devoured *Your Money or Your Life*, *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and *The Richest Man in Babylon*.  My wife and I planned out our financial goals (Get student loan free, then try to retire in 15 years; will finish well ahead of this) and drastically reduced expenses.  Started aggressively paying down student loans by ‘minimum payment amount’ first to reduce our DTI ratio, hoping to qualify for a mortgage.

I became obsessed with the idea of having a miniature empire of rental units that would help me reach FI faster: small, clean, well-maintained places that I loved and the tenants loved.  Planned to ‘house hack’ by getting a duplex and living in half – the worse shape the better!  I’d always been handy, I was looking forward to sweat equity.  Started looking for a house in May.

Got married in July of this year; I suppose all previous references to ‘wife’ should read fiancé before this. . .

**Bought a duplex:** We were approved for a mortgage due to having some *long* repayment lengths on student loans which kept our DTI ratio on *just* the right side of acceptable, and bought an absolute shithole of a duplex with 3% down in November in a pretty nice neighborhood in Minneapolis.  This was $196K, which seemed *really* high from the lows of 2009; that sounds funny in retrospect now looking back, but everyone was worried it was the midst of a second bubble at the time.  Moved in to one half, and inherited some tenants in the other.  Started rapidly fixing it up with every spare hour I had, as I was still working about 60 hours a week on average.

It was a busy year.

**Income: 52K me, 44K wife, 96K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$140,000**

* *2014:*

Hey, the NW is moving the right direction!!  But now we reach “the boring middle” part of FIRE.  My wife got a full time job with benefits (as opposed to a fellowship) with a pay bump.  I got a 12% raise from my terrible company, mostly in response to threatening to leave due to working conditions.  Working conditions did not improve.  At the end of the year I switched companies (wont’ be reflected in this years salary) to the place I’m still with.  They are a hugely better company to work for, and they pay for *every* hour I work.  The pay was about the same per hour, but since I was working 60hr/week I essentially got a 50% raise.

We began to live on just my wife’s paycheck, and used 100% of mine to pay off student loans/invest.  This hasn’t changed to this day. . . except we now also invest some of hers.

**Income: 58K me, 56K wife, 114K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$97,000**

More of the same, paying off student loans in 2016, continuing the aggressive saving until 2020. . .

* *2016:* **Income: 86K me, 70K wife, 156K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$33,000**

* *2017:* **Income: 101K me, 72K wife, 173K comb   ||  Expenses: ~60K  ||  NW: $45,000**

* *2018:* **Income: 93K me, 74K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $110,000**

* *2019:* **Income: 92K me, 75K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $300,000**

* *2020:* **Income: 110K me, 76K wife, 186K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $700K**

Note that NW has some weird jumps once we got past zero because the duplex went from essentially zero cash flow (lot of costs going in tended to burn all the rental income) to positive cash flow as we started to wrap the years of renovations, to a huge jump upon sale.

 
###2020:  Deciding to Simplify (Start again here, this is the point of the post!)

We had a kid.  

I had already been getting worn out of rental maintenance, especially as we had moved out of the duplex entirely and were renting both halves, now that it was nice.  Working a ton, and feeling like between a (more than) full time job, child, and rental, something had to give.  It was amazingly difficult to find a decent rental manager.

Our personal expenses had slowly shrunk down to be about $4,000/month, $1,500 of which was the mortgage on our new house.  In addition were the duplex costs, and the possibility that I had to have enough cash reserves to cover three furnaces, three water heaters, three stoves; also potential vacancies, other big ticket items (like a $14,000 roof job on the duplex, water damage from ice dams, etc) that were always potentially looming.

The rental income *did* cover these expenses: The duplex was working as a business.  But I was having basically $7,000 a month in expenses despite a fairly frugal lifestyle that had to be covered; **$84,000 a year that *had* to be earned and burned no matter what.**  My wife took a big chunk of time off for maternity, and I wanted to do significantly less, but this ‘burn rate’ was weighing on me.

Our three biggest expenses were the duplex, our house, and taxes.  Taxes are as low as they can be (all tax-advantaged accounts maxed out) and I’m happy to give back to the education and food programs that helped me, growing up.  But, I could sell the duplex, and roll all the profit into the new mortgage, and potentially go from needing to earn and burn $84,000 per year to $30,000. . .
 
###Rent out vs. Sell

I ran the numbers on if I kept the duplex, vs selling and investing it in the stock market.  I looked over the the next 6 years, which is about/past my FIRE date.  My estimated net worth difference would be around $80,000!  Nothing to sneeze at!  However, it also would be the difference between ~$1.3M and ~1.2M, both of which are over my FIRE number of $950K for 3.25% SWR.  If this had been the difference between $0 and $100K, that’d be huge.  That 1st 100K is the hardest.  The 13th 100K, however, is not.

I also had the added wrinkle that if we sold in 2020, it counts as a primary residence, and we don’t pay gains tax on the part we had lived in two of the last five years; this reduced the calculated 80k difference.

**Purposeful “Mistake” number 1: The duplex is gone.**

Was it worth an 8% reduction in net worth in 6 years to me to not have to deal with the rental property with a young child or two?  A thousand times yes.  I will have, I think, significantly less wealth in 30 years because I sold the rental duplex back in July.  But I will have *enough* either way, and I shall never get these years back.

I think buying, renovating, and renting that duplex was the best single financial action I ever took.  I’m happy I ground it out and did the completely hellish task of gutting a 110 year old building in the evenings around a 60hr/week job.  I also don’t think I’ll ever do it again. . .

### Pay off Mortgage vs Invest

What about, now that I’ve sold the duplex, putting it all in the market vs. paying off our home mortgage?  The numbers are pretty simple:  

5% real returns in the stock market (8% returns, 3% inflation, assumed).  Mortgage was, by happenstance, almost the same amount we got out in cash from the duplex, $153K.  We would then not have to pay the $1500/month that was going to principal and interest, and could invest that.  All number – as always – in 2021 dollars for simplicity.

* $153K invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $205k.
* $1,500/month invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $125K.
* A difference of, again, $80,000.  At least I’m consistent. . .

This one was much harder; I really wanted to reduce my ‘burn rate’, but this basically means that selling the duplex **and** using that to immediately pay off my mortgage made us (statistically) $160,000 poorer in about 6 years, another $80k of gains gone.

However, despite me not believing (allegedly) in timing the market, the CAPE is currently quite high. . . and I’m getting awfully close to being able to FIRE anyways, 4-8 years, pending variables.  I also intend to transition my 100% equities to a [100/60/100 V-shaped Bond Glide]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) to maximize safety at the cost of potential gains.  I also believe that [it doesn’t make sense to carry a mortgage into early or regular retirement]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/10/11/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-21-mortgage-in-retirement/).  These aren’t just numbers in a spreadsheet, I actually have to be able to shift the funds to be able to do this, in a way that’s not crippling from a tax perspective.  It’s going to take years to shift to a bond allocation slowly; trying to pay the mortgage off at the same time could very well be impossible.

I don’t have a target FIRE date; I intend to work less and less as I slide into ER, and having the mortgage paid off means that my wife and I can do this whenever we want, without having to do 5 years of financial maneuvering in the background to ‘pull the trigger’.  

The flexibility is worth it.  **Purposeful “Mistake” number 2: The mortgage is gone.**.

We now live very comfortable – I would say luxurious – lives on about $2,500/month.  This will increase sporadically for large trips and childcare, but is our past and current expenses, and will be further in the future too.  I intend to build a fairly large cushion in passive income over this for unforeseen events, then charity, if those don’t materialize, but we don’t feel impoverished in any way at this spending level.

We are privileged enough, lucky enough, and determined enough to now be making about $45/hr each gross, $36/hour each takehome.  This means we need to work a combined 70 hours in a month to be able to cover our expenses; that’s 35 hours each, or  an average about 8 hours *a week* throughout the year.  We are primed to be able to slowly “BaristaFIRE” with reduced hours and benefits in our current jobs, which we both (mostly) enjoy.  

We will both be only when we want – which might be not at all – by age 40.  If you had asked me at 25 if this was possible, I would have laughed in your face.",financialindependence

33,Were you happier before discovering FIRE? Ignorance is bliss? Feeling like my obsession with FIRE and money has taken over my life.,,1261,kzma15,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kzma15/were_you_happier_before_discovering_fire/,1610941189.0,"TL;DR - My motivation to FIRE has taken over my life to the point where I'm having a hard time enjoying spending my money or the simple joys and journey of life because I see every decision as either helping or harming my ability to FIRE.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

I discovered FIRE about 2-3 years ago after a friend posted an article to a blog post from Millenial Revolution. Luckily enough, I had made some of the right decisions already (i.e. paid off my student loans, contributed to 401k up to match), but after I discovered FIRE and calculated that I could retire early in 7 years, I started to aggressively save, dumped every spare dollar into index funds, and lowered all my expenses.

I hit $500K in net worth last month and it was a satisfying number to look at, yet as I was scrolling through old photos of myself from 5-7 years ago, I realized I wasn't necessarily happier for it. Over the past 2 years, I realized I've become more annoyed with work, and paralyzed or fearful of making any decisions that jeopardize my ability to FIRE. In the past, I would happily book an expensive, peak-season flight to an international country, buy a new camera just because I wanted it and I would be driven and motivated at work, exhibiting all the behaviors I needed to land that next promotion.

But since discovering FIRE, I haven't taken any international trips, haven't bought anything that's expensive yet could further my hobbies or interests (e.g. new camera for photography, roof rack for car), and outright stopped caring about work to the point where my attitude towards it has become bitter and resentful. I figure if I just coast at my job for the next few years, I'll hit my FIRE goal within 5-7 years. But it is actually out of character for me to care so little about my career and feel so apathetic. My coworkers are pretty surprised and baffled at my apathy towards work.

I'm seeing every single decision I make is either for or against achieving FIRE. Have a baby? But that might push out my FIRE date. Buy a house? It would be a dumb decision in NYC based on all the blog posts I've read. Hold a wedding? How many more years will I need to work? Buy a new laptop? But that's $XXXXX lost if I invested it in the market instead. Get a new job? Why bother, I just need to suck it up for 5 more years. Etc. Etc.

Now I'm wondering if I would've been happier if I didn't discover FIRE at all... If I was ignorant? I see some friends who have no idea what FIRE is happily enjoying their money and their life and I am jealous of them. I feel like it's become a mental restraint I've placed on myself. And these next 5 years feel like they're going to be pretty miserable until I can hit my FIRE #.

Any suggestions on how to break out of this mindset would be appreciated!",financialindependence

Checking in for my fourth annual post. I post these as a way to motivate people who don't make crazy incomes. When I started posting, we collectively grossed about 82k in total income with BAs. We've grown and now gross a little north of $107k  W2 income with MAs, as well as $15,300 gross annual rental income. This is in a LCOL city in the Midwest.

The tl;dr of previous posts is that we taught/worked abroad in China for three years, eliminating 55k of student debt and paving the way to pay for grad school in cash. Moved back to the US in 2017, where I work as a social service administrator and SO works as a teacher. Somewhere along the way we picked up real estate investing, but nothing too substantial compared to some people.

**INCOME/W-2 EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY**

\---Me (29 y/o) - Social Service Program Manager - $52,481 +7.5% match

I've been WFH since all of this began, which coupled with my parental leaves means I haven't been in the office for over a year. I’m still having issues with my supervisor, so much so that I nearly quit during one of the flare ups and took a lower pay paraeducator position to escape the relationship. Instead of going that route, I enrolled in a program that will get me certified in the US to teach. I should be certified in summer 2021, I’ve applied for some positions for next year and may choose to pivot away to teaching again at that point. It’s difficult to plan for this though, as my company has incredible benefits and we’re still growing our family. Golden handcuffs. Despite the challenges with my supervisor, I was told during my performance review that I’m a high achiever and continuing to exceed expectations. I tried leveraging that for a 10% pay bump, but HR policies and the COVID context ultimately put a stop to that. All staff in my company were given 2% raises, regardless of performance.

\---Spouse (28 y/o) - Teacher - $54,861

SO continues to love her job, though teaching in the COVID context while mother to a newborn has been emotionally and physically challenging. SO received an 8.53% pay bump from last year due to 1) continuing to plow through additional coursework to move up salary scale, 2) being nominated to join a specialized committee ($500), 3) the salary schedule being renegotiated upward for the fourth year in a row, and 4) being nominated to mentor a new teacher ($1000).

**FAMILY SUMMARY**

We’re both getting itchy feet to go abroad again. While I’m actively applying for positions in my company overseas, we’ve both essentially accepted that it will need to be through teaching. I had a dislike for teaching, but have come to accept that work is something I will likely never ‘enjoy’ and I will likely transition in and out of fields during my working career. Fortunately, the two fields I’ve done are relatively symbiotic and can be leveraged for career advancement. We hope to relocate abroad in the near future, ideally in fall 2022. Updates other than this? We received an unexpected 15k gift that went to brokerage accounts. I picked up guitar October 2019 and have really taken to it, adding significantly to my mental health and resilience during the pandemic. SO has taken up art, adding similar benefits. Kiddo is happy and healthy, and a huge joy to our family. I love being a dad, and the perspective gained from this experience (combined with having financial assets) makes my less than ideal supervisor situation so much more manageable. I just have to remember to take a step back and say, “Does what she’s mad about actually matter in the grand scheme of things?”.

**BUSINESS SUMMARY**

Property #1 - 20% down on $60,000 SFR, $800 base rent with $40 and later $60 pet rent

Last year I reported our realtor thinking we could sell for $75,000 after some slight renovation. We were on the fence with this, but after selling our primary residence at a profit, we were hungry for more while mitigating the risk of the neighborhood the property was in. On closer inspection, our realtor indicated 5k in renovation may catch 80k quickly. We went forward with it, things went overbudget 2.5k, and we ended up listing for 85k. The house sold in 7 hours for 90k. Basing ROI on our 12k downpayment, our overall ROI for this property was 67.47%, while learning a lot about business, landlording, and home repair. Overall, a definite win. We’ll see how this all shakes out with taxes this year, though it should be LTCG and I think we have enough deductions to shield from tax liability.

&#x200B;

Property #2 - 10% down on $270,000 Duplex, \*$2575 rent\*, estimated $2800 rent potential

This is our current primary residence. Class A neighborhood with class A tenants. We pay ourselves $1300 in rent to simulate renter performance. Our tenants started with us at $1200, but after adding a fence (we and the tenants have dogs), this was bumped to $1225 within the first month. We then did a full floor renovation in the fall, bumping rent to $1275. I’d like to find a way to bump rent to $1300, but we have really excellent tenants that take amazing care of the house. Shampooing carpets every 6 months, painting the entire unit (we covered paint costs), adding shelves to the garage, and even sodding the backyard. After the fall renovation, we signed them for a 2 year lease, locking in the great tenants and income for the remainder of the time we envision being in the US.

COVID has been crazy for real estate, with prices skyrocketing in our city. 3 months after purchasing this property, another sold down the street for 30k more than we purchased for. This was lower quality interior, poorly thought out floor plan, and only $1100 rent. Last month I was shopping duplexes and did some walkthroughs. I noticed much lower quality properties in similar zip codes going for 70k more than we purchased for. I asked our realtor to run the numbers and was told we could likely sell for $420-$450k. Which is CRAZY! I’m incredibly tempted to sell now, but I think the family needs some stability. We’ll likely revisit the topic next year when we would qualify for capital gains exclusion after 2 years of residence and be closer to our planned move abroad.

Equity - $31,178.29

Cash - $9,349.17

&#x200B;

Total 2020 contributions - $36,769.45

For 2021, I’m hoping to have more sustained high contributions. From my side of the income, 20%+7.5% match ($1110.19) will be going to retirement, while SO will have about $1375 monthly. I’ve also set up automatic investments of $35/week to go to each of our roths and our brokerage. An interesting observation I noticed with this is that upping our contributions significantly doesn’t have as large of an effect as I would have expected in my FIRE Calc.This is likely because of our already significant contributions, combined with how much has already been contributed already and how growth doesn’t have as much of a chance to take over. For example, we could step off the gas and just do our bare minimums (getting match and required pension) and we still FIRE at 52, as opposed to 42 currently. Whereas if we strain ourselves to what might be uncomfortable, we shift the FIRE date to 40 years old. This is all based on a 5.84% return, so pretty conservative.

Not sure what else to add, [but here are some parts of my spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/Xno3ms4) I like to look at when work has me down.

tl;dr - Still chugging along, still planning, still growing. Happy.",financialindependence

38,Another immigrant story! From 10/hr in my mid-twenties to coast fire in early 30s,,284,kytsns,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kytsns/another_immigrant_story_from_10hr_in_my/,1610838789.0,"I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while. This sub has really helped me with my relationship to money and to understand the cost/benefit of time vs money. This sub is especially helpful to people like me that come from a different country and no one in their family has retirement accounts or knows how to invest. 

I have been coast fired since late last year when I left my job. I’ll give you a quick summary of my background and then I’ll just talk about coast fire and my finances. 

Summary: Family came to U.S with no money, zero English and was undocumented. Got my citizenship in my early 20s. First and only one in extended family to graduate from college at 25. Once I started making real money, I found this sub and learned how to invest and think about money. I went from making $10/hour in my early 20s to $100k by my 30s. Long hours led to burn out and quit once I was coast fire. Took some time off and now working as freelancer. 

Life in coast fire: I’m working from home so I can run errands during the week. I don’t have an alarm clock, just wake up on my own. I have time to exercise and also take a 40 minute walk on most days. I can take a long lunch if I want to. Once or twice a week I’ll go to the park or a trail nearby.  One thing I hated about working is going to work early and leaving by the time it was dark. I really appreciate the opportunity to spend some time outside basking in the sun during the week. I have more time to meditate and I’ve read a lot more books during this time. 

I volunteer for some organizations and I’m part of some boards. I joined an organization to help me with public speaking & we meet weekly. Even though I haven’t been working full-time like before I’ve managed to keep busy.

I’ve tried different hobbies this past year thanks to the advice of this sub. I tried skiing, baking, drawing, Pilates, oil painting, journaling, a mindfulness course, biking, nail art, and basic coding. There were several hobbies I did not enjoy and won’t do again but I’ll keep up with a couple like journaling and riding my bike. 

Once Covid is under control, I want to spend summers or winters traveling for three months out of the year. And I want to try more social hobbies such as golf and tennis beginner classes, line-dancing, going to more concerts and music festivals, a photography class, book club and some leadership seminars. 

Finances: My net worth consists of my 401k that was rollover to Vanguard, Roth IRA accounts and some brokerage accounts. I don’t have a house and I don’t think I’ll buy one. 

According to mint this is my net worth over time. I don’t have data prior to 2018 because I wasn’t keeping track before.

2018 $100,000 
2019 $200,000 
2020 $250,000 

Budget 
Rent $6,000 
Groceries/ eating out $4,600 
Shopping $2,600 
Auto $1,700 
Travel $1,600 
Personal care $600 
Bills $2,700 
Business expenses $3,500 * this also includes cobra & disability insurance that I paid for the last 3 months of 2020. 

Salary Progression 
Before college $8 to $10/hour | After college $40k/year > $45k > $52k > $62k > $78k $85k > $90k > $100k 

The only debt I have is about $5k in student loans. This means that I only need around $20k to cover my expenses. But I’d like to make more to have more money to travel in style, pay for some classes and just have more room in the budget.

I feel that now I have an idea of what I’d like to do if I do end up retiring early. And this also showed me that I can fill my time and have structure even when I’m not working.",financialindependence
39,Does anyone have costs tracked by year by child?

43,Mostly ready to retire. I am an old fart compared to most here. FIRE was not a thing when I started working/saving. I am trying to determine what I want to do as I contemplate pulling the trigger.,,240,kxfws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kxfws6/mostly_ready_to_retire_i_am_an_old_fart_compared/,1610661735.0,"I am 57 and have a net worth of approx 1.3M.  800K in self-directed IRA.  200K in non-sheltered investments, about 50K in my new company 401k, 130K in cash (due to a sale of a home).  Home free and clear about 130K in value.

I have been a single income provider working in IT for the last several decades.  The majority of my funds are the result of maxing out my 401K since I entered the workforce.  In that time I have owned several homes.  moved several times and paid cash for my kids (2) college, cars, weddings etc.  


I recently took a job managing development, QA and data services for a company based out of a small town in midwest.  Middle of no-where.

My wife and I absolutely love the small town vibe.   we have always lived in larger metro-plex suburbia.

I have always assumed that I would just keep working until my mid-60s and then; not sure (retire, die, something).  I have never really planned out what happens after.

Living in a small town I have really grown to appreciate the outdoor activities.  Hiking, fishing, (Hunting again after 25+ years).  


I am suddenly very much thinking about just.....   NOT WORKING anymore.    


With really liking small town vibe; owning a house free and clear.  No big expenses (kids/education/etc).  I am just realizing that I can probably do so tomorrow if I wished.  


I am new to this sub-reddit and after reading through a lot of this, I realize that i really could have focused on this as a family goal and probably retired 10 years ago if we had prioritized additional investments.  Rather than just investing through my employer plans.

This is a lot of rambling, please forgive me.  But I want you guys to know that this is VERY doable.  I got here and I wasn't even really focused on this goal.  I just laid out a mostly painless path through 401K investing.

From a retirement perspective my wife and I have gotten very excited about potential travel to equivalent locals globally.  Meaning, look for small towns in Costa Rico, Panama, Portugal, Montenegro, etc and stay for 3 months at a time.  get to know the people and the culture.  I have had the good fortune to travel quite a bit for work and vacations.  But I have NEVER had a break longer than 10 days since 03/21/88 (first day on a ""real"" job)

NOTE:
I am overwhelmed by the amount of support and very helpful and interesting feedback I have received.  My intent was just to encourage others in their progress.  I have gained much more that I gave through this exchange.

After a strenuous career working your way towards financial independence, do any of you have or plan to have a *fun, no stress* job after you achieve FI, to remain productive in a familiar sense or socialize with people? 

During high school, I worked at a movie theater along with 2 (regularly retired) older gentlemen who lived comfortably, but worked at the movie theater a few days a week to talk to people, see free movies, and generally keep themselves entertained and sane.

Are any of you planning on doing the same?

For those who aren't familiar with my story, here are links to the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/)  from early 2019 and [1 Year Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f261kn/update_1_year_in_and_loving_it_35_11m_luck/) in early 2020.

TL/DR:

* Net worth increased from $1.40M to $1.61M
* Spent  $30,600 which is under my budget of $33500. This was despite donating an unbudgeted $5400 to charitable organizations
* Cancelled most my of travel plans and adapted to COVID shelter-in-place orders
* Got an article written on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanderousseau/2020/03/05/36-year-old-retiree-5-years-without-paying-housing/) about me
* Invited to a WNYC radio program about finances, but it didn't materialize because of COVID.
* Joined the board of directors and became an officer at one of my queer summer camps
* Didn't meet any of my goals I set out for 2020
* Played A LOT of board and video games online

Next parts I'll break into sub-headings if you want to go to specific parts:

* Life in a Time of Covid
* Major Life Events
* Finances
* Notable Experiences (Pre and During-Covid)
* Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

# Life in a Time of Covid

2020 will almost certainly be remembered and defined by COVID and the changes that came from it. I have a friend who was already ringing alarm bells by mid-January about its possible impact, so I had some time to process and mentally prepare for things once the shelter-in-place orders actually hit in March.

Despite being a fairly low risk to severe impacts of COVID (relatively young and no conditions that pre-dispose myself to severe complications), I chose to take what most would consider to be low risk approach for reasons including, but not limited to, wanting to minimize my potential risk to others and that the long-haul effects of the virus are still very unknown. I have the privilege of not needing to work and put myself at risk and I want to ensure that I'm not contributing to the risk of those who don't have a choice and/or are vulnerable.

*Note: Everyone has their own situation and I'm not attemtping to shame anyone for their personal choices. As someone who is part of the queer community, I think the AIDS crisis is a good, but imperfect, analogy and lesson at how shaming does not work and discussion of harm reduction is the most effective tactic. The limitation of that analogy is that you are effectively only putting yourself and your sexual partners at risk, whereas with COVID, you could really be harming a lot more people who haven't opted in to your risk profile. In short, there are personal decisions that people need to make like seeing their family or having some companionship, but I will in no way condone egregious actions like large unmasked gatherings.*

As an extroverted person who would host regular board game nights, go rock climbing with my climbing partner at the gym, see theater productions, go to board game conventions with thousands of people, and travel to multiple international destinations each year, this year has certainly been difficult. It isn't the year I planned, but I have tried to make the best of it as possible.

How have I adapted to varying shelter in place orders and tried to salvage a pretty bad year?

* Created a couple of Discord servers to maintain contact with various friend groups
* Played board games online using Tabletop Simulator with Discord - I logged over 450 hours on Tabletop Simulator alone!
* Played video Games - Logged 350 hours of Civilization 6 and 175 hours of Hades
* Got a crash pad and been rock climbing outdoor (past two months)
* Movie nights over Zoom/Discord
* Volunteer work online - phonebanking for elections, virtual summer camp activities, virtual workshops.

Basically - Discord and online video/board games have been keeping me sane.

# Major Life Events

Content/Trigger warning - Death and suicide mentioned in the next set of bullet points

* Became a first time uncle but unfortunately couldn't visit my niece. Hoping it will happen sometime by the end of 2021 or early 2022, depending on when I can get a vaccine.
* Had an acquaintance/former coworker take his own life at the beginning of the pandemic (stock market falling, depression, and pandemic stress all contributed).  This particularly impacted me because unlike the next life item, I didn't have the chance to say ""goodbye"". When I officially quit my job and turned my laptop in January, I was going to see him in the office, but I was running late to another commitment. I thought I'd be able to catch up with him some other time, but unfortunately that wasn't meant to be. My fondest memory is when we went to see a World Series game together. It was a bucket list item for me and while no one else was wanting to shell out the cash, he gladly joined me and we had a blast. We got to see Game 2 of the 2010 World Series @ AT&T Park with Matt Cain pitching a gem of a game and a wild 8th inning where the Giants scored two runs via walks and exploded to a blow out victory.
* This summer I had my mom call me and ask for me to hop on a plane to visit becuase my grandma was in the hospital and only had a few more days to live.  I packed up my stuff that night and took the first flight out in the morning. My grandparent passed away (not COVID) about two weeks later and luckily all of our family was able to spend time with her at a family member's home in pallative care and got to say our goodbyes in person.  Note - family visited while masked and socially distanced. She lived a very long life and was able to pass away with family around her, which is about as much as I could ask for given all the other heartbreaking stories I've heard this year of family members not being able to say goodbye.
* I was voluntold (I was happy to help out though) to be the coordinator/project manager and to delegate tasks and facilitate decisions between my grandma's 6 children. THIS WAS STRESSFUL. My grandma didn't even have any assets to squabble over, but decades of emotions and inter-personal conflicts surfaced. Additionally COVID created a complicating situation where, at the time, the church allowed a maximum of 30 people for the service. Problem is that my grandma has 24 direct descendents and counting spouses and step kids that put the number at 35.  This doesn't even include family friends and/or her extended adopted family (she was among one of 6 adopted children). In the end, everything ""worked out"" but not without a ~~bit of~~ LOT OF stress working through the guest list.

# Finances

**Net Worth:** Increased from $1.40M to $1.61M

**Income:** Dividends + Capital Gains: $18,100  (The Capital Gains were via distributions, not sale of investments)

**Spending:** $30,600 out of $33,500 budget. My budget at my current net worth would represent a 2.1% withdrawal rate

The linked image provides my 2020 [Budget, 2020 Actual Spend, and Differences](https://imgur.com/a/MjnLZEq).

You'll note that there are some big differenes in planned versus actual, namely my travel spend was virtually non-existant and I decided that I wanted to donate more to charity this year given that I have more than enough and there were many people and organizations that didn't have enough. Below lists out my notable notable big ticket expenditures for the year.

* Charitable Giving - $5400
* Laptop - $1600
* Rowing Machine - $1050
* Various REI Purchases - $1200

My food budget shrank significantly as I didn't eat out and rarely did take out - it was only $3500 out of a $6000 budget. I still ate well, but did a lot more home-cooking and simpler food - a lot of stuff that my mom would make for me as a kid. I fully expect that my food budget will go up once COVID restrictions lift, but I imagine that they won't go back to pre-COVID spending levels.

For 2021 I will keep my budget the same at $33,500 but will likely come in way under it with my non-charity expenses, but I will probably end up covering the difference by contributing more to charities.

**FIRE Actions:**

* Converted $12,555 from my Rollover IRA into Roth IRA as part of a Roth IRA ladder ($12,400 standard deduction but slight variance at end of day)
* Was vigilant and didn't take any buy/sell action despite the dip in the spring! I briefly lost my two comma status and I got a little bit of anxiety at the trough, but stayed firm with the buy/hold Bogleheads strategy.
* Less of a FIRE action, but more of a reduction in my FIRE risk - CA AB1482  went into effect 1/1/2020 which is effectively a state-wide rent control which limits rent increases to inflation plus 5% per year. I was conservative in my withdrawal rate knowing that a sudden rent hike could happen and I needed to account for it. But now having additional protection via this law, it means I'm EXTRA safe with my withdrawal rate.

**Lean FIRE ""Trial-Run""**

If there was one silver lining 2020 with respect to FIRE, 2020 showed me that a realistic lean FIRE number for me would be around $23,000, which were my expenses this year excluding my charitable contributions and my two big ticket purchases. At my current net worth, this would represent a 1.43% withdrawal rate. I don't plan to spending less money than my FIRE budget of $33,500 - but it shows me that I have a lot of flexibility to adapt IF I absolutely needed to.

# Notable experiences since my last update:

Despite 2020 being a pretty awful year in general, there were a few notable things non-financial experienices/accomplishments that are worth mentioning:

* Became a board member and officer for one of my queer summer camps.
* Participated in virtual queer summer camp and got the ""Golden Unicorn"" (MVP) award!
* Beat Hades and got 49/49 achievements. Highest heat beat is 22.
* Nearly finished our Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 campaign.  Our group of 4 has played S1, S2, and now S0 together and it has been a wonderful shared experience.  I'm glad we could still make playing Pandemic Legacy a reality in a the midst of a IRL Pandemic.
* Visited WDW/US for 10 days total (Pre-Covid) and got to ride Rise of the Resistance... twice. OH MY GOD that ride is AMAZING. It mixes some amazing jaw-dropping visuals, fast paced action, and a tad bit of ""immersive theater"".
* Camped at Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and a few state parks in WA.

# Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

2020 Goals

* ~~Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.~~
* ~~Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).~~
* ~~Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).~~
* ~~Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor. I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.~~

As you can see I didn't meet any of my goals for year 2, but that's COVID for ya.  I would still like to do the first three goals at some point (probably not 2021 at this rate) but realized that I no longer would like to do NOLS/Outward bound. So what are my new goals for the upcoming year? I have to temper it given that I am pretty low on the list to get vaccinated and the world is probably going to still be uncertain. The basis of these goals is based on if they can be done solo and/or with people without specific skillsets (hard to find people with the right skills to pod with and have similar risk profiles) and don't require me to be vaccinated (assuming that for the in-person interaction, it will still be masked/socially distanced).

* Continue to serve on my board and find volunteer opportunities for both queer summer camps, hopefully in person at camp.
* Get involved in local youth outdoor activities such as ICO ([https://www.sierraclub.org/ico](https://www.sierraclub.org/ico)), which has more flexibility than something like NOLS/Outward Bound. I'm also hoping to create/lead a rock climbing program for queer POC youth in my area.
* Do more local outdoor activities (climbing, hiking, biking).
* Camp at a few ""local"" National Parks - Death Valley, King's Canyon, Sequoia
* I have the least control on this last one, but as soon as I'm vaccinated I would love to take an international trip by the end of the year, ideally to Brazil or Laos.

48,"TIL Warren Buffet ""retired early""",,1757,kvzs92,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvzs92/til_warren_buffet_retired_early/,1610482814.0,"I was watching a video on YouTube about Buffett's early years and it mentioned that at the age of 25, he felt he had enough funds to retire and was seriously considering it.

Quote from him:  “The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.” 

In ""retirement"", some people asked him what to do with their money, and he ended up starting a partnership to help manage money... the rest is history!

Just a fun thing I thought I'd share in this forum \^\^

49,Be careful with the predefined FIRE concepts,,968,kvwpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvwpam/be_careful_with_the_predefined_fire_concepts/,1610474045.0,"FIRE is one tool eliminating material scarcity from the list of things you have to worry about, which is great considering the larger goal of building a life you want to live. 
Extreme saving to build up capital equaling 25x your expenses is one way to achieve FIRE. 
Retirement, in the traditional sense of retiring to a life of no particular work responsibilities is one type of retirement. 
BaristaFIREing to a quiet life of easy work is another option. 

All of these things have names. But all of these things are merely arbitrary points on a spectrum of infinite possibilities. Life isn't a forking path, with traditional FIRE going one way, with baristaFIRE pointing in the other direction, and no middle ground between them. You're ""allowed"" to retire to a life based on the 6% rule, with baristafire as a backup. You're allowed to become financially independent and never quit your job if you don't feel like it. You're allowed to retire at 32 fully FI, get bored, start a pottery studio, live off the income from the pottery studio for a while, get bored, close it down, then get a job with the county government cutting down trees. Life is too short to limit your choices to the default options on a forum. 

I think everyone here is aware of this, on some level. But, really  often on this sub, I see people falling into the easy ruts, like treating the 4% rule as an actual rule. Or, they let the easily defined concepts, like coastFIRE, define their goals, when it's pretty clear based on reading their writing that their real goal should be in the Grey Area Of FIRE That Has No Name Yet. Grey Area Fire That Has No Name Yet is perfectly fine.  

Don't let mental frameworks define your path -- let your honest assessment of the life you want to live define your path, and let the rough concepts and frameworks serve their purpose: giving people a starting point for conversations.",financialindependence

51,"Have you let diminishing returns lower your savings rate and voluntarily inflated your lifestyle once your nest egg was large enough? What's the ""critical mass"" of your nest egg?",,82,kw8jzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kw8jzr/have_you_let_diminishing_returns_lower_your/,1610510684.0,"I'm playing with some numbers and it's quickly becoming apparent to me that having a high savings rate has diminishing returns once your nest egg is of a certain size.

For example, if you have $300k and are aiming for a cool $1m, you could save $25k per year and reach your goal in about 10.5 years thanks to compound interest.  Alternatively, you could save $50k per year and reach your goal in about 7.5 years.

In essence, having double the savings rate only shaves about 3 years off your timeline.  Of course, that's still a substantial amount of time but I start to ask those classic questions about the tradeoff.  The $25k per year difference is pretty substantial.  That's multiple awesome vacations per year for a decade.  That's housing upgrades.  That's college tuition.  All for just a few years longer.

I realize none of these ideas are new, and that all of this is a tradeoff.  I realize that ""One More Year"" syndrome and CoastFI probably have their roots in this line of thinking, but man—when faced with actual numbers, it seems like a no-brainer to ease up on your savings rate after hitting a certain critical mass.

How have you processed these same thoughts and crunched these same numbers?  Did you find you hit a ""critical mass"" of a nest egg and were able to feel comfortable spending a bit more?  What was that critical mass for you?",financialindependence

54,Military Reserves in FIRE,,238,kvhtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kvhtz4/military_reserves_in_fire/,1610417102.0,"Hi, I'm wondering if anyone has incorporated the reserves as a barista fire option. I was on active duty for a while and spent a short amount of time in a reserve component and it seems like a great fit for fire so I'd be curious to get other people's takes. Here are my initial thoughts:

* If I join again soon, I'll probably be an O4 (i.e. mid level officer) by my barista fire time period, so I'd maybe make around $15k - $25k / year depending on how much drill there is beyond the standard  2 days/month, 2 weeks/year (I always had to do more when I was in, which was a pain with a full time career, but 3 or 4 day weekends once a month doesn't sound as bad when you're not juggling a professional job).
* Cheap health insurance: \~$50/m for single, \~$200/m for family.
* I don't know how competitive these are but there are full-time positions in the reserves that you can take. In a FIRE emergency situation (either market crash or large unexpected expense), there's a path to a $100K+ job. I truly am not sure how difficult it is to get these full-time positions, but I imagine it's more likely than trying to go back to most professional jobs after 10 or 15 years out of the industry (I know in my field I would never get an interview with a gap that large; plus, you can take these positions for a year rather than trying to get a 100k+ job in the private sector that you want to quit after your investments recover).
* Pension: depending on far up the ranks you go and how long you stay in, it's probably $20k - $30k / yr plus cheap health insurance starting at 60.
* Some structure/progress in life: I know some folks want nothing to do with work--which I totally get--but I think it'd be nice to still have an organization that you can progress through but that doesn't take 60 hours/week of your life.
* There are probably some cool assignments that come up over time, especially as you get to a higher rank.
* Serve my country (This is a big positive for me, although I'm sure it's less meaningful to others). 

Obviously, possibility of deployment is a large con, and if someone is tired of hierarchy,  then the military is the last place you'd want to be.

I burnt out of the reserves while trying to balance a professional job but it sounds like a good barista fire job. What does everyone here think?

Also, one more thing since this came up (and dominated) all the prior threads on this top: joining the military for this is a less attractive option. You need 1 year+ of full time training (with certain exceptions) that will be a decidedly un-fire-like experience so this is geared more towards people who are already in or were in.",financialindependence
55,Inside the r/financialindependence Time Machine,,1233,kv2si9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kv2si9/inside_the_rfinancialindependence_time_machine/,1610372290.0,"I started writing this post to try and get my thoughts out, and also guide some of the newer members of the sub. Instead I went back through old posts and just pondered on how the sub had changed since it started.

First lets teleport back to 9 years ago, the world is falling apart due to the Arab spring, but Osama’s dead, the London Olympics is around the corner and the UK and US are looking like they are recovering, curiosity rover landed on mars. Around 1000 subscribers on the financialindependence sub:

The financial crisis is still ringing in the back of your head, you knew people who seemed well off who lost their jobs and houses, the job market has been shit for a while. My parents sold all their shares in 2008/2009 and had three 0% down repayment mortgages for example (it was common knowledge in 2006 that it was a guaranteed way to be rich, reminds me of tesla/bitcoin). However, green shoots have been spreading for a while, 2010 wasn’t too bad really, 2011 is going great. The market is still two thirds below 2008 levels.

You most probably read earlyretirementextreme or thesimpledollar, you most probably had read your money or your life, the millionaire next door or a random walk down wall street. You might have somehow found the bogleheads forum and got linked  through to reddit. I personally couldn’t find any of these resources and was looking at Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, Forex trading, buying houses etc.

So what are the main beliefs and thoughts? The main themes on the subreddit is sustainability, frugalness, being happier with less. I really think that’s a reflection of the time and points in a good way to survivorship bias. The best examples of people who had stayed the course were frugal and lived below their means, they had diversified assets. Index funds werent anywhere near as popular then either so it was much harder to not lose everything in the GFC, but some people were on the index fund train and were comfortable enough to power through. The only real way people could have done that is cut expenses and live within your means.

Heres some example posts. Note all the comments are about living happily with less.

Zoom forward a couple of years to joining at the start of 2015, the world isnt really falling apart yet until next year (BoJo and Trump arent taken seriously), uptown funk hit number 1, Game of Thrones anyone? I think this sub hit 100,000 subscribers around then:

The stock market is on an absolute tear, its finally surpassed its 2008 highs in 2014. The mood everywhere is pretty good, house prices have done very well in cities and recovered in most suburbs. The common person has started feeling ok about stocks again but has no idea what an index fund is, stocks are still considered pretty dangerous if you speak to your uncle. I distinctly remember reading lots of articles (maybe slightly earlier) that Amazon was a bad investment as it didn’t make profit, dividend paying stocks like utilities, oil and tobacco were the game of the day. I personally had made some disastrous plays into renewable energy stocks around 2014/15 as I was trying to be sustainable.

You definitely read mrmoneymustache, probably religiously. You probably post here and read some of the other various blogs in the side bar (frugalwoods, jlcollions, getrichslowly etc.). You may have found the sub through some kooky articles on CNBC or the BBC. The book selections havent really changed much at all.

Main conversation points? Frugality is still the name of the day. Living a happy and sustainable life. Riding bicycles everywhere and doing your own repairs. 4% rule is king. Some dissenting opinions are brewing about how incredulous it is to retire on $600,000, but the conversation is very polite. The veterans' portfolios are really starting to bear fruit and gain notoriety after investing through the downturn (or at least not selling and cutting down expenses).

I really enjoyed reading some of the top posts from this year.

/[u/rootofgoodblog](https://www.reddit.com/user/rootofgoodblog/) ‘s retirement announcement. Some disagreement about whether $32,000 was enough (spoiler, it was, maybe even too much so far) [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired\_at\_33\_with\_32000yr\_retirement\_budget\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired_at_33_with_32000yr_retirement_budget_me/)

Zoom forward to the present day. >800,000k subscribers, the world is falling apart again, WAP was number one for some reason:

10 plus years of constant returns, a flash crash near the start of the year scared the shit out of everyone for all of a month.  You probably know people not working now, but you’ve kept your job and also have saved extra this year. Your mate might even be sitting pretty on 5 bitcoins and some tesla stock. Instead of instilling fear the crash has instilled confidence. Every man and his dog has some ETF ‘Index’ funds. Turns out renewables and Amazon were the right call, go figure. Still, I have more money than the people at work bragging about bitcoin, not that I tell them. If I’d invested in index funds in 2011, not 2014/5, rather than a house, individual shares etc. I’d be richer. If I’d not invested in a second property after that I’d be a lot less stressed at the least.

More than likely you found the site through somebody linking through to the sub, it might have even popped up on your feed. Theres a plethora of blogs and youtube channels, you might listen to choosefi, but just as likely other investing podcasts. The dinosaur blogger portfolios have hit unimaginable heights. Mostly they seem pretty bored of blogging now and rarely post. You probably work in software, you really might just be browsing around and shaking your head at the incredible wealth, you might equally have come and cannot fathom why people think 10% returns are good, you might equally also think 4% of your portfolio sounds risky.

Conversation points now? Money is king. Lots more people that have stayed the course. It’s very common to be told that your portfolio isnt enough, its also pretty common to have to defend some luck you’ve had.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular\_opinion\_1m\_isnt\_a\_lot\_of\_money\_anymore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular_opinion_1m_isnt_a_lot_of_money_anymore/) By my reckoning that was about $870k in 2011. I’d like to think people were arguing about shiller cape ratios, but not really.  The estimates of FIRE have definitely ballooned.

Now what’s my point? My original thinking was to write this for my own benefit. But also just show people it’s important to run their own race and be nice to each other, but to also think in terms of decades rather than thinking in the present. It took 6 years for the stock market to recover in 2008, this time it took 6 months. So much happens, so many plans seem incredulous but work out, some people get lucky, some people don’t. The people that have stayed the course are more than likely frugal, more than likely good at sticking to an achievable plan, and more than likely good at tracking things so they can adjust quickly. However some people stayed rich from the 2000’s housing boom the same way some people will stay rich from bitcoin and the 1990s tech stock boom. This fact is not my problem, I have a plan and I’m sticking to it. I had to message my dad regularly in March not to sell, although thankfully this time he had a competent financial advisor that he actually listened to rather than his son.

Where will you be in 9 years? It’s good to think about that.

57,FIRE Success story in the making - Learn to Earn,,166,kurz7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kurz7v/fire_success_story_in_the_making_learn_to_earn/,1610328097.0,"Hi Everyone, Longtime lurker first time poster here. I just wanted to thank many of you guys for the tips over the years and to give a bit of inspiration and tips to those who earn much less than the normal posters here. 

To give some perspective i'm 31 and 6 years into my FI journey (2 years into FIRE) I got started at 25 (2015) I was making about $300 per week in construction and my wife was out of work. One day I discovered the book The Richest Man in Babylon and was off to the races. Before that I was always a decent saver but had very little income, that book changed my outlook and my life. I started saving 1/10th of gross income and throwing into individual high quality stocks.

We were fortunate to live in a Very LCOL area but had about $5k in credit card debt and being in a small town without many job prospects and only a high school diploma not much hope of anything better but I still saved my $30 per week. 

I also started to follow the advice in the book and work on educating myself, I have always enjoyed technology and decided that would be my road out of the heat and cold of construction work. After looking through educational opportunities I decided to go for an IT degree with WGU since I figured I could accelerate and finish the degree earlier than expected. I did tons of research and was super excited when I sent in my Application to WGU. Unfortunately though I was declined...... From WGU... I felt dejected and stupid. A few days later I was told that my rejection was due to having 0 transferable credits and that If I went to a Community College and earned some I would probably be admitted. Sounds easy enough but I lived in a small town no where near a CC so i gave up on that and kept saving.   

About 7 months after being Rejected a new WGU admissions counselor called me and asked about my plans. He informed me that in place of college credits I could take 1 of the IT certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+)  and get enrolled if I passed one. I went on Amazon that day and spent 2 weeks worth of savings ($60) on a book to take the Network+ as I was very interested in understanding Networking and thought I could work on learning it as a new skill.

I studied and studied day and night (8hrs per day after work) for 4 months, paid the $300 test fee and scheduled the test. Never felt as much pressure on a test before since I knew I couldn't afford a retake. That test was the most difficult test I had ever taken in my entire life. I was so nervous to click the submit button at the end of it that I was sweating. But I passed! A few weeks later I was enrolled in WGU! And a few weeks after that since I had a Net+ cert I got a JOB! in IT! the pay was $13 per hour and a 45 min drive but I knew that was my shot and made it count. I was 26 when all of this happened (1 year into my FI journey). 

Fast forward - I advanced in the IT dept at that first company always volunteering to figure out and fix the hardest issues and seeking challenges while continuing the WGU course material. After a few years I had enough experience working with Data Systems that I moved a few hours away to a Larger Medium COL city and took a contract job making $90,000 per year. From that job I moved up the ladder and began saving more and more especially after discovering this sub-reddit.

 My wife and I were so impoverished in the beginning that we got used to that level of income and although we spend about $40k per year now including rent ($2300 per month), Insurance, utilities and car payments (We bought hail damaged cars 10K off brand new) as well as taking 2 large vacations per year internationally. We don't buy luxury items and still bargain hunt. On top of that my salary has increased to $140k and by living in a larger city my wife was able to get a job making around $30k. We now save 50+% of our income and work from home.  

Last year at 30 (5 years removed from poverty) I earned that Bachelors from WGU in IT. It took a lot longer than I hoped but that was due to my employment situation. I also hit the $100K Net worth mark that would have seemed like Mt. Everest not that long ago.  

I mainly wanted to post this for the ones who are starting off like I did 6 years ago. In small towns, without education or skills it can be a lot harder to find opportunities and its very easy to give up but I'm living proof that escape is possible and all of these 100K+ jobs that seem like dreams are actually very possible with a few years of hard work and determination. I really hope that you guys just keep working towards your goals, Don't let anyone or anything discourage you or disrupt your plans even if it hurts just keep going after it.",financialindependence

61,FI people with adult children - how are they doing financially?,,835,ktxls4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ktxls4/fi_people_with_adult_children_how_are_they_doing/,1610220686.0,"I am trying to teach my 13yo about how money works and the importance of saving and investing. She gets money from a few sources, including a weekly allowance, gifts from relatives, and a small amount from working in my business. I require her to save 30% of everything she receives, which goes into her savings account. I show her how the account is growing, and I told her that once it gets to $3,000, she can invest it in the stock market (mutual fund).

Still, I'm not sure that this is making any sense to her. Does anyone have any success or failure stories when it came to teaching your now-grown children about money?

&#x200B;

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your advice, experience, anecdotes, snarky replies and funny stories! After reading every comment, these are the takeaways that will shape my next steps:

&#x200B;

1. Some people (or their kids) ""got it"" (saving and investing) at a young age - like kindergarten. Others got it in their 20s or later. Some said their kids still haven't gotten it. I conclude that, for my daughter, investing for the long term is probably too abstract at her age.
2. A LOT of you gave incentives/were incentivized to save (e.g. like matching savings) and make money (chores or jobs). There were a couple examples of the bucket system and games. One person mentioned charity. Great idea.
3. Many of you taught or learned through example, and said kids are ""always watching"" even if it isn't readily understood at the time. Not just finance stuff.
4. It is better to teach than to not teach. There is a risk of backfiring or it may not have any effect at all, but many wished their parents had guided them when they were young.
5. On a technical note, some questioned the $3k investing threshold. I was still stuck in the Vanguard minimums. When the time comes, we'll look at ETFs.
6. There are a lot of resources for teaching kids about money. Books and YouTube.

Given the above, I've decided that first I'm going to show her how to budget the money she has and will be receiving in the near future (like allowance). Investing was just putting the cart before the horse so to speak. I talked to her about budgeting yesterday, and she showed me a note she keeps on her phone. It lists her current savings and money coming in. So that was good. I'm also going to kill two birds with one stone and show her how to use Google Sheets. Will be good to keep track but also to teach her about spreadsheets in general (not just for finance). She's also focused on saving up for a new phone,  so that can ""anchor"" the lesson. 

Next, I'm going give her some incentives for saving. Not sure exactly what yet, but something like matching 50% of the savings she's accumulated by each birthday (Initially I wanted 100% but my wife laughed and said that by high school we might owe her all of our money lol).

Finally, I need to be a bit more aware of my own habits. There were a couple times when she didn't have any money with her and I had to loan her $5 or so until the end of the day. I'm going to stop doing that for the most part. Also, I owe her some money for gift cards that I bought from her, but I've been letting it float for too long. Kids are watching, right?

Actually just a couple more things about what I ""read into"" many comments. There is a LOT of love (sometimes tough love) passed from parents to their kids through money lessons. Parents have done what they can, but also stressed that kids need the freedom to make their own mistakes. Hearing all these stories was very encouraging. Kudos to the FI community!

68,We should measure spending as % of MIT's Living Wage instead of % of Income,,529,ks7o8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ks7o8k/we_should_measure_spending_as_of_mits_living_wage/,1610001854.0,"I'm proposing the use of [MIT's Living Wage](https://livingwage.mit.edu/) to compare across people and their spending in the FI community. 

Too many people in this sub use % of Income, yet that isn't useful when for some people with very high salaries decreasing their spending means cutting back on only the most superfluous luxuries (fancy cars, boats, McMansions, etc.) while for others with more modest salaries it means cutting back on more typical luxuries such as eating out, vacations, spacious housing, etc. 

I think the living wage calculation is particularly good as it breaks down basic spending across all of the most significant spending categories, as well as taking into consideration the cost of living in any particular metro area/county, the number of dependents, and the number of income earning adults in the household. 

The fundamental idea behind living wage is that it is the amount of money necessary for someone to live a minimally comfortable life. Now I'm not saying that everyone should be aiming to be at or below this number, the documentation of the calculator even states that the values it provides are simply a ""step-up"" from poverty, but I think that these values would provide a good relative target, for example within 150%, to help people aim towards with their spending.",financialindependence

My fathers expenses have more than doubled since my mother died. He has a degenerative disease and has to pay for people to come to his house to help with things like making food and getting dressed. My FIRE budget certainly would not cover these kinds of expenses. In our area, its impossible to find reliable home aids who would be covered under Medicaid after he runs out of money (which will happen this year). So his only other option would be a nursing home. Until he is vaccinated, that is not an option. My family lives in a small home and we have lived a frugal lifestyle. I have no where to put him in my own home and he wouldn’t want to move here anyway. My expenses have also increased as I travel often to see my father and help in any way I can. For those who already live a conservative lifestyle, don’t fall into the trap of planning a retirement budget of 80-100% of your pre-retirement expenses. I am adjusting my approach and setting 150% as my new target. This is causing me to have to completely rewrite my plans. Most elderly people are not going for a walk in the park one day and dead the next. The process can be ugly, time consuming, and expensive. That mini-retirement I was planning may be spent as a caregiver for a parent. If you successfully apply the FIRE principles, people will know it and will come to you for help. Even if they don’t ask, you may feel compelled. Maybe not a parent, but someone close that you care about. Are you prepared for this?  (I wasn't)",financialindependence

74,Long Term Care Insurance and FIRE,,79,kr2tfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kr2tfm/long_term_care_insurance_and_fire/,1609867032.0,"After reading this post by [u/WebsterDad](https://www.reddit.com/user/WebsterDad/), where many people suggested that Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI) should be part of a FIRE plan for those of us in the US, I decided to start a separate thread about it.  I am going to condense some of the important points about LTCI from that thread into this one.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the\_real\_costs\_of\_aging\_and\_impact\_on\_adult/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the_real_costs_of_aging_and_impact_on_adult/)

LONG TERM CARE AND GENERATIONAL POVERY

I had not realized how the cost of long term care for parents can wreck someone's plan to use FIRE to escape the cycle of generational poverty.  If your parents were low income or did not save for their own retirement, and you are trying to break that cycle of poverty by pursuing FIRE, your plans may be jeopardized because you need to use your nest egg to pay for your parents' care.  Similarly, if you need to pay for your own longterm care out of your own nest egg, you won't have as much money to pass down to your own children.

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

In the US, people over ~~62~~ 65 are eligible for Medicare, which helps with medical bills, but people are not eligible for Medicaid, which helps with long term care, until they have used up all their resources, including their equity in their home, and are effectively destitute.  Even then, the long term care provided by Medicaid is in short supply, is determined by the laws of individual states, and anecdotally is much worse than private care.  Lastly, any assets given to children with in the previous five (soon to be seven) years of applying for medicaid still count in the calculation, and will likely prevent parents from being eligible.

So, is LTCI the solution?  Should LTCI be part of our FIRE plans?

PRICE OF LONG TERM CARE

Here are national averages according to genworth.com.

     In-home care 5000/month
     Assisted Living 4500/month
     Nursing Home 8000/month

Care cost is location dependent.  You can find averages for your state here [https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html](https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html)

COST OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

Long term care insurance usually has a benefit cap of about 160K, with a defined daily or monthly benefit (for example, $180 or $5000 respectively).  That means that ""Long term care"" only last around three years before the benefit is exhausted.

Insurance cost is location and age dependent, but here is a guide

     Average annual premium
    
     AGE 55
     Single Male	$1,876
     Single Female	$3,141
    
     AGE 65
     Single Male	$3,081
     Single Female	$5,085

From [https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749](https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749).  Note that female cost is higher because they live longer and are therefore may be more likely to need long term care.

SO IS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOUR FIRE PLANS?

You really only need insurance for things you can't pay for yourself.  So, is LTCI worthwhile?

Let's look at a very simplistic example.  Assume I start my policy at age 55, and pay until age 70, then fall ill and die after three years of care.

I would have paid about 34K over 15 years (1876 x 10 years + 3081 x 5) for the insurance.  So I (or my estate) would come out 144k ahead (minus the opportunity cost of not having that money invested).

I have three kids that stand to inherit my estate, so part of my FIRE plan is capital preservation for them, so LTCI seems like a good bet for me.

What about you?

While 40 isn't old, I don't want to keep running on autopilot until 50, or 60, and miss my opportunity to work less while young enough to enjoy it. 

Anyone else dealt with this scenario before?   What did you do? 

FYI I don't have enough 401k to retire and live on it yet, but calculations show I probably have enough to leave it be and then would have enough by the time I'm 65.   This the question about coast fire. 

Thanks.

Edit - thanks for all the replies.  What I'm thinking is maybe go for ""just another year or two"" full time if I can swing it, pad the accounts a bit more, which I probably can do since I'm not miserable and I'm in (seemingly) quite good health, and then at that point try to negotiate down to 3 or 4 days a week at the current place of employment and run that way for a while and see how it feels.  

That way I can keep doing something I know well and still be making enough money to tuck away a few dollars every month yet not live like a college student.   If I were to get say 60% of my paycheck now, I'd be fine since we are in a lcol area and don't have a mortgage or really any other payments besides utilities.   

My wife has great Healthcare (as do I) so we'd probably jump onto her plan if I went part time.  But at some point health care will be the kicker.  If she wants to go down to part time we will somehow need $1000/mo or more for health insurance.  Maybe we will have a public option by then.  I hope.  If not I guess one of us works full time until we are 67.  Fun.",financialindependence

77,A valuation approach to the safe withdrawal rate,,898,kqbuzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqbuzl/a_valuation_approach_to_the_safe_withdrawal_rate/,1609777077.0,"So I put together a white paper of sorts for a study I did on safe withdrawal rates and how they're affected by market valuations. I had previously taken a more qualitative look at it ([HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ajp2y4/market_valuation_and_its_effects_on_the_safe)),  but I wanted to expand on the idea and actually see if it were possible to formulate a SWR forecast. Links to the paper are listed below. 

[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yO0K96Iyc09ihjk8f6j-yZizVGVJDCvw/view?usp=sharing)

[Excel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n8suK1EdGLvpuXJ_JtKRx9cF4rO0VrO/view?usp=sharing)

In the paper, I shared my methodology as well as proposed a variable withdrawal strategy based on this new valuation approach. 

I think it's worth the read (and it's not very long with lots of pictures), but I'll share some of the findings below. 



**Quick Intro**

I calculated the actual SWR for every year from 1928 to 1990. I compiled these SWR's along with the CAPE (Shiller PE) and 10 year treasury yield for each starting period, and performed a linear regression analysis on the data. The resulting equation showed good correlation (R^2 = 0.72). Refer to the paper for more details on the methodology. 

All data in the study is for a 70/30 portfolio.



**Findings**

The 95% confidence formula for SWR based on this valuation approach is as follows:

SWR_predicted = 0.55597 × (Implied Yield) + 0.11051 × (Spread) + 0.0082319

where, 

Implied Yield = 0.7 × (1/CAPE) + 0.3 × (Treasury Yield)

Spread = 1/CAPE - (Treasury Yield)



**Variable Withdrawal Method**

In the paper, I looked at one way to implement this valuation approach and compared it to the trinity study. The basis was simply withdraw the amount based on the predicted SWR and portfolio value at the start of each year. I set a withdrawal floor at the minimum of 40k or the 1st years withdrawal amount. Setting a floor is important from a practical sense as any methodology that could leave you withdrawing at the poverty level isn't very useful. 

Performing a back test, this method never failed in any 30 year period, and also reduces the likelihood of massive portfolio expansion like trinity study has in the past (1980's for example). Withdrawals taken from year to year are also relatively smooth with the variable approach. 

In the paper, I shared portfolio performance and withdrawal summaries for some interesting years: 1929, 1966, 1982, 2000.



**Current State of Affairs**

To kick off 2021, the current projected SWR is projected to be between 2.35% - 4.81% (likely a little higher after this morning). The lower bound of 2.35% ties the year 2000 as the lowest predicted SWR of all years in this study.

80,"Adapting to changing conditions- Consider Investing in dividend paying stocks as ""bubble/volatility proofing"" when FIRE",,0,kr3tkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kr3tkm/adapting_to_changing_conditions_consider/,1609869797.0,"So the common idea on here is to just go into a broad stock market ETF like VTI and just withdraw a fixed amount each year. Basically, 4% is the magical safe withdrawal rate, so once you hit $1 million, you can withdraw $40,000+ inflation for life. Most of this belief is based on historical data.

We then saw a post earlier this week that showed that a 4% withdrawal rate since 2000 from the S&P500 meant that your current NW would be just 23% of the starting amount. This would certainly cause anxiety especially with the market volatility https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kpodhb/charts_2020_a_good_year_for_people_who_retired_in/

Some people might argue ""you cherry picked the worst year"", but mathematically, you're most likely to hit your retirement goals when the market boomed to an all time high than after a crash.

When the tech bubble crashed, the S&P500 dropped by nearly 50%. If you were invested in tech ""growth"" stocks, you would've been hit way harder. The Nasdaq fell by 77%!

When relying on selling shares to fund retirement, you're vulnerable to whatever price the market dictates. So if unjustified panic results in prices too low, you still have to sell at that price.

So if you lose 50% of share value, your 4% withdrawal rate becomes 8% of your portfolio.

In the past, bonds were the means of hedging against said volatility risks. But back in 2000 bonds were yielding 6% and were actually a great alternative. Now treasuries yield 1% which won't even beat inflation.

I would argue that in the age of low interest rates, dividends should play an important role in protection against excess valuations for retirees.

Dividends historically have been less volatile than share prices. For example while the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 50% in 2000, dividend payments hardly budged https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend/table/by-year The same is true in 2009, when the stock market dropped by 60-70%, but dividends only dropped 20%.

As was seen in 2000, Some of the companies most at risk of bubble territory are companies that aren't paying dividends. Companies that don't return capital to shareholders, but are priced highly based on expectations of future growth. 

Most of the stock market price growth for this year has been from non-dividend payers like Tesla and Amazon. Tesla is currently trading at 34 times their annual revenue, and 1459 times their earnings. So much growth is priced in that the slightest slowdown in growth will decimate their price.


As a young investor trying to grow wealth to reach fire, investing in growth opportunities can be a good long term play. Even if you buy into a bubble you have time to recover if you hold. Lower prices are an opportunity to buy more for less. But as someone depending on their stock portfolio for income, a change in prices affects you dramatically.

Historically, the dividend yield on the S&P500 was high enough to fund retirement on it's own. Before 1985 the yield was almost always above 3%, and often averaged above 4%.

However the dividend yield on the index as a whole has hit record lows this year, as valuations of growth companies surge, and companies look to buybacks and acquisitions rather than dividends to utilize excess capital.

With the S&P500 dividend yield being at all time lows(1.5%), overall market dividends don't provide the level protection they have historically. With treasury yields at <1%, they are vulnerable to inflation/interest rate hikes, have little upside, and produce little to no income.

Investing in a dividend paying index to provide a baseline level of income can help reduce the need to sell during a downturn while still providing upside.",financialindependence
81,(Charts!) 2020: a good year for people who retired in 2000!,,653,kpodhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kpodhb/charts_2020_a_good_year_for_people_who_retired_in/,1609694137.0,"**Data**

* [Graph 1](https://imgur.com/a/qZFlNuK): Graph of percent of portfolio remaining over time for people who retired in 1/1/2000, comparing different withdrawal rates. Focused on people allocated 100% S&P500, with one line of 10-yr treasuries for comparison

&#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow!

82,4% Withdrawal vs Distributing ETF,,12,kq49q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kq49q0/4_withdrawal_vs_distributing_etf/,1609747279.0,"Once the retirement moment comes, the 4% withdrawal rule (or a more conservative 3.25%) should be used to provide a regular stream of cash to cover the living expenses expenses. I see a potential problem with this: in a typical FIRE portfolio the stock portion is large, and even larger now that bonds do not provide any return. Hence, in case of market swings, the total value of the retirement portfolio could get a negative drop (e.g. last March with the Covid crash).

QUESTION: in a retirement phase, shall the FIRE portfolio move to a more conservative mix and how to do so?

As alternative, what about migrating the growth portfolio used to reach the retirement new worth to a retirement portfolio based on distributing ETF? 

Just to give some examples on these latter products that I found (the dividend value is just an indication, not in real time with markets):

\- GLDV >> dividend \~4%

\- IAPD >> divident \~4%

\-STHE >> divident \~5%

\- EMLOC >> dividend \~5%

The above distributing ETF should provide a more stable conservation of the retirement capital, compared to a growth portfolio too pushed towards the stocks market in order to get.

I might be wrong, hence happy to discuss here - especially with people already in the RE phase.",financialindependence
83,How many early retirees continue to contribute to advantaged accounts after ‘retirement’?,,27,kpy48w,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kpy48w/how_many_early_retirees_continue_to_contribute_to/,1609724165.0,"I’m Early 40s. Partner is mid 30s. 

We built a retirement portfolio in rental property. The cash flow basically covers living expenses and inflation adjusts. In 15ish years cash flow will boom again when mortgages start to go away.

She left her corporate job 2 years ago and is a realtor now. It was supposed to be pre-tirement  but even working part time she is making 3x our annual expenses. The taxes are brutal.  We set up a sepp and she is pretty close to maxing that out annually. 
Add into this the fact that I flip houses occasionally and those hit as ordinary income. 

So if I leave my w-2 and business continues to be good do people typically continue to ‘save for retirement’ when retired?  Is there a point when income is already on track to be way more than enough by classic retirement age?

84,In defense of OMY Syndrome,,54,kppkkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kppkkq/in_defense_of_omy_syndrome/,1609697726.0,"After another instance of looking in the mirror and asking myself where the heck another year went, the idea that we are always ‘in the present’ - and its relation to FIRE - occurred to me.

If we assume that, whenever we retire, the only thing that matters is how we feel in the present, we can make a stronger case for making that moment as comfortable as possible.  I would definitely rather fly first class and have six vacations a year, as opposed to coach / two.  I would rather eat extravagantly than not.

Giving your money one more chance to rise by 50%, say another 4-5 years, would likely drastically change your comfort level for all your future “present”s.

It’s a similar concept as going through all the work to graduate college.  I have little memory these days of the pain of sleepless nights writing papers, but I’m sure glad, now, I put in the time to do it.  I don’t remember the struggle, but my present self reaps the gains every day. 

I feel this is different than the standard reasoning behind OMY, which is generally tied to wanting a bit of a cushion or concerns about current market conditions (ie, sequence of returns risk).

We can never predict how long we have on this earth, so I fully recognize the above can jeopardize some of that precious time.  But I do feel strongly that the past is always just a memory, and my present self is almost always happy with prior sacrifices I’ve made.

**TL;DR**: grew up in poverty (financially only, plenty of love and plenty to be happy for), worked hard, valued education, and now I'm getting by. Components of my dashboard are **-linked-** within the post. Enjoy and critique!

**Background**

I'm 27, male, single, grew up in poverty in the rural Midwest. I'm first generation college along with my 2 siblings, state school educated, and tend to think I live below my means. I've been introduced as ""the cheapest a-hole you'll ever meet."" While I am frugal, I always pay more than my fair share, feed guests and provide alcohol, volunteer my time, and tip generously when services are provided (haircuts, meals out, ice cream).

I won't apologize for any privilege. My parents are hard working, loving people who dedicate their lives to our family. There was no family college or direct financial assistance. One of my earliest memories was asking my father if we were rich. His response, ""we are rich in love."" Growing up, we were 5 people living the American Dream, as far as I'm concerned.

I'm employed as an System Admin within the Federal Government. I'm IT by trade only; I majored in a physical science (BS & MS), and gravitated toward statistics and computer science within my field. My earnings/location by year:

* 2015-2016, WI, $15,000 (graduate school)
* 2017, DC, $45,000
* 2018, DC, $56,000
* 2019, DC, $69,000
* 2020, DC -> IN, $86,000
* 2021, IN, $93,000

I've been tracking money in and money out since starting grad school in Sept 2015. I'm talking every receipt, categorized (split & figure tax/item if, say, making a Walmart run purchasing variety of goods) and entered into excel. My approach will certainly seem excessive to some, but it takes me < 1 min to enter the data usually, and I find it fun and worthwhile. Different strokes for different folks.  I've collectively spent MANY untracked hours tracking my economy and developing this tool. It's an ever-changing tool that was originally based off of this [rudimentary budget](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-budget-spreadsheet.html), and grew in inspiration of many of the financial tools I've come across in this sub.  I have linked to graph inspirations for those looking to replicate.

**-**[**Assets**](https://imgur.com/5Rb535S)**-**

My spreadsheet is driven by this Data-Assets timeline. In this snapshot, the timeline spans my period of record, Sept 2015 - Dec 2020. The blocks on the left are fairly self-explanatory. ""Returns"" are shown over the course of the timeline and for the last month (Dec 2020 in this case). ""Balance"" is the Asset balance for the last month of the timeline, and the Net/In/Out is the money in/out during that month. I count investments as money out, so the 'net' is money that didn't have a destination (didn't pay bills/groceries/get invested/etc). ""Savings Rate' donuts are for the last month of the timeline (dark green, 77% for Dec) and the year of the month (light green, 27% for 2020). This savings rate is: ((Take home pay - non savings spending) / take home pay). ""Financial Independence"" was an effort to track FI, though there is a lot of variability. ""Inflation Rate"" is non-savings/non-tax spending compared to the year before. This helps keep my lifestyle inflation in check. I moved cross-country and purchased a vehicle in cash in 2020, which contributed to the 2020 personal inflation.

Here is what the graph on the right represents:

* Purple: Health Savings Account. The dark purple is the amount of HSA invested; the light purple is held by the bank, earning 0.02%. The purple line is total $ in HSA
* Green: liquid assets. The bars represent Savings/Checking/Money Market, CDs, and Series EE Bonds, which were gifts from grandparents in the 90s/00s. The green line is total $ in fairly-easy-to-liquefy vehicles. I am risk averse and hold too much here, though home ownership is hopefully < 5 years away.
* Blue: Investments. The dark blue is retirement (Roth IRA and Thrift Savings Plan-a 401k). The light blue is my taxable brokerage. The blue line is total $ invested
* Black: total assets. I do not include vehicles or belongings in this. I rent, so no equity either.

The IRA/TSP/HSA donuts are used to see where I am in terms of contributions vs limits. Don't worry, the surplus $233 in IRA and $250 in HSA are 2020 contributions to the 2019 IRA/HSA.

**-**[**Expenses**](https://imgur.com/c6zdkL2)**-**

​""Past 12 months"" are sparkline columns representing the relative proportion of the category over the past 12 months (right-most column is darker and is the last month of the timeline, Dec 2020 here). The categories are: taxes, housing, savings, transportation, food, utilities, medical, personal (clothing/toiletries/etc), alcohol, and entertainment. The actual vs expected graph (based on [this](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/5838-excel-actual-vs-budget-chart.html)) shows what percent I spent on a category relative to my Net (after tax) Income (except I use Gross for savings and taxes). This doesn't add to 100 since I use a different basis for comparing 2 categories. This Savings rate calculation is *dedicated*\-savings only, which differs from the one in the 'Assets' section. I need to revisit, pick one way to calculate, and run with that.

A note on transportation. Prior to tracking, I owned a 1990 98 Oldsmobile regency and then a 1986 Ford Ranger. These vehicles cost $500 and $550 cash, and I paid that and insurance. And they broke down a lot and I spent a lot on repairs (though my dad and I did many of them at home). I lived car-free from 2015-mid2020. I bought a used Japanese car in Sept 2020 in cash when I moved to Indiana. I hope to keep it for many years.

The graph on the right is one of my favorites. I use GETPIVOTDATA to populate the table and create a heat-map of the selected category/sub-category. I can select as many subcategories to compare as I want. The graph is annual cumulative expenses based off the dynamic table. The gray lines are previous years, the bold black line is the average of the previous years, and the red line is the current year. The text (2020: $XXX, Average: $XXX) shows the current month vs average spending to date. This graph has really opened my eyes to the evolution of my spending habits. As a proud Wisconsinite, I've selected my alcohol-related expenses to compare in this image. ""Alcohol"" is liquor store purchases, and ""bars"" is money spent at bars.  In 2016, I was studying a lot and mostly pre-gaming and riding the buzz. Also, it was cheap to get drunk in Wisconsin (25 cent beer nights).  I spent a lot of time in DC bars being a reckless 20-something. I only drink socially, so consumption is down in 2020 thanks to COVID.

**-**[**Loans**](https://imgur.com/H3Sih7t)**-**

The home and vehicle loans are placeholders for whenever I might get those types of loans. My student loans were subsidized. I qualified for academic, community, and need-based scholarships and grants. They paid for my tuition and fees in full, and then some. I was a work-study student, which gave me an edge when applying for on-campus jobs. I averaged 25 hours of work per week, and volunteers 5 hours a week. I was enrolled full-time with 16-18 credit hours per semester. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA undergrad, and 3.9 GPA grad from a great Big 10 school. I worked my ass off and wasn't truly burdened by student loans, knowing I could pay off the loans I took at any time. The money I did borrow went toward living expenses and into the bank, since it was interest-free while enrolled. The amortization graphs are based on [this](https://spreadsheetpage.com/loan/amortization/).

This is the my third year following up on the [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/e6mdm0/from_10k_to_650k_in_65_years_with_graph/) and [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bjghrb/from_10k_to_500k_in_6_years_with_graph/) financial review posts.

Honestly, not much has happened this year with the pandemic. My wife and 1.5 year old toddler basically stayed (and attempted to work) at home since March. Spending is pretty darn low (about 36% of our income) but we've been cooking some amazing meals. Missed some awesome vacations and have pretty much settled into a ""I never want to step into an office again"" mindset. This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on...well today(ish).

**This graph is for two people, not just me as of July 2015**

Since the last updated I've:

* Started a second Amazon Affiliate site that is now generating 2k a month with zero effort.
* Kept my toddler alive and unharmed
* Built an awesome outdoor kitchen with only the help of my wife

Some answers to common questions are below:

* This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 29 years old, live in Houston, TX and have a 1.5 year old. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference we currently have around 191k in equity in our home and owe 148k (total value of house is \~340k) . We have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. We do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good. We'll pay it off in around 3 years or so. If you include real estate we've got over a million bucks!
* We keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when we bought our first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and we bought our next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we no longer have.
* Our taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* We have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Wife bough a new car this year (ugh) but at least it was a good deal and is less than $500/mo I think. It does not impact our savings rates.
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -> 74K promotion ->97k old job -> 115k current job)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -> 84k promotion -> 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-> max IRA's -> invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -> pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",financialindependence

89,Realized Freedom Is More Than Money,,2273,koc0i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/koc0i5/realized_freedom_is_more_than_money/,1609510862.0,"A couple of years ago I got into FIRE and was ecstatic, as most of you were the first time you heard about it and realized ""wow, this can actually be done?!"". So of course, saving and investing became a big part of my life. Earlier this year however, something happened in my life and I decided to also start taking care of myself. Went on a diet, started exercising and have so far lost about 30 lbs.

I can now do 5K runs and I don't even feel it. It's nothing now. My goal is to work up to doing half marathons. Anyway, I recently started reflecting on what freedom really means to me. Freedom is not merely being able to give your stupid desk job the finger, or having the ability to spend your time as you wish thanks to material wealth accumulation.

Freedom is thinking about what you'd really like to achieve in life, and then going for it without fear, regret or what anyone else thinks. Freedom isn't having the option to eat cheeseburgers and doritos all the time, even though it technically is. The problem with doing so is that it separates you from the best version of yourself, and the best version of yourself is the freest form of yourself. Think about it:

The best version of yourself is the one YOU want to become. Want to be strong, athletic and have a nice body? Figure out what you need to do to get there. Take advice from guys who have what you want, replicate what they're doing, and eventually refine it such that it works better for you. This can only be done through self-discipline. Self-discipline = freedom, as Jocko Willink puts it.

FIRE is ultimately a mindset. Besides, as Charlie Munger once said: ""life is more than being shrewd at passive wealth accumulation"". Don't get me wrong, keep saving, folks. Just make sure you focus on maximizing your freedom in other areas of life as well. Imagine how freeing it is to be able to run long distances and not have to worry. You can just do it. It takes you places. You see things, scenery, people. You challenge yourself and it makes you feel good afterwards. THAT is true freedom.

90,Why I don’t want to FIRE as soon as possible.,,52,komsej,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/komsej/why_i_dont_want_to_fire_as_soon_as_possible/,1609547290.0,"Like many, when I first discovered FIRE I was consumed - I started tracking my spending, budgeting, researching investments and attempting to increase my income. Naturally, to begin I read and researched a lot, there was a lot to learn. I made some meaningful strides, and now have everything set in place, all I need to do is continue to save and invest and I’ll FIRE in 10 or so years. But I have continued to read, to research, to plan, to analyse, to overthink. This is not necessarily a bad thing but now I feel FIRE may be becoming too much of a focus - I’m too fixated on achieving FIRE above all else - and I think that will make me less happy.

Don’t get me wrong, I feel very lucky to have found the FIRE movement and to be able to confidently say I’ll be financially independent one day. What a gift that is in a world where most people constantly stress about money and are unsure if they will be able to retire.

My issue is feeling consumed by FIRE. Recently I found myself entertaining and working towards pursuing a career that will make me more money but would make me miserable (law). I started thinking yes I won’t like the work, it’ll be a tough corporate grind, but I’ll make more money and could FIRE faster so it’s worth it. I started putting FIRE as my number one objective and everything else, including happiness was secondary. This, in my opinion is the wrong way to think. 

I don’t want FIRE to be all about the destination, I want to enjoy the journey. I don’t want to work everyday until I’m 40 just to leave the workforce and say now I can start living. I want to go on long adventurous holidays, enjoy the work that I do, volunteer, spend my weekends with friends, focus on hobbies that make me happy - even though these things will slow down my path to FIRE. I don’t mind if I achieve FIRE 5 years later than I could have if I’ve enjoyed the journey twice as much along the way. Just something to think about. 

TLDR; achieving FIRE asap may be harmful to your long term happiness. You should enjoy the journey and not just the destination. Maybe consider doing some more fun stuff along the way 😊",financialindependence
91,Early Retirement Update (EOY 2020),,1006,ko2559,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ko2559/early_retirement_update_eoy_2020/,1609463330.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (with home/land). Our actual withdrawal rate is much less than the original 3% of portfolio due to: occasionally earning additional passive income; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (below). The budgeted maximum withdrawal amount for 2021 is $3,904/mo or $46,858/yr (now 2% of net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We’re so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an ebay business while in college ($10k), and student loans ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average. My parents initially promised to cover the student loans out of what they deemed to be principle, but we assumed them when purchasing their home/farm in 2019 ($380k + assumption of student loans + free rent for life, for an estimated $750k home/farm that is now probably closer to $900k).

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was initially 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents’ home/farm, our net worth is closer to 50% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another house with 66 acres) / 50% VTSAX (total US stock market). We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment, social security, other inheritances, universal health care, or universal basic income. The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**2020 RECAP**

**Spending**: Living expenses for 2020 came to $39,458 (max budget $41,736). We generated $8,045 of income this year from some almost entirely passive stuff. Our investment withdrawal was $31,413 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.51% for the year (max budget 2%). Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 1.89% for the year. Spending guideline for 2021 will be $46,858 (2% of net worth). Our net worth has gone from $1,333,772 (start) to $2,342,926 (current). Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out, got all of it back, and padded the portfolio even further. The New York Times reached out to me again in March to see if I was financially ruined, but I had to disappoint them.

**Experiences**: I ran nearly 2000 miles after my competitive running career came to a close (personal records: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). That’s way down from 3000 miles in 2019, but I switched over to cycling (2000 miles) primarily during the summer (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete). I allowed the pandemic and others’ imbecilic denial of reality surrounding the pandemic to make this a less productive year. I mostly stayed home and stuck with existing hobbies (reading, gaming, watching movies, web browsing, vintage card/nintendo collecting, hiking, bird watching, shopping for my parents, following the near demise of our republic). I even reapplied with my old employer and the state volunteer medical core to help with immunizations for the upcoming year, but I am apparently not wanted.

**Upcoming**: In 2021, I want to get vaccinated so that I can return to society, learn to swim effectively without a snorkel, learn to play some basic piano, look into becoming a race director, continue running for my physical/mental health, find some new volunteer opportunities, decrease my time in the digital world, spend more time with existing hobbies, make up for lost traveling (California #3, Hawaii #2, Japan #3), and continue to do whatever the fuck I want.",financialindependence

93,[2020] Year in review. Part 3 of my annual contribution to r/financialindependence,,15,kodzr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kodzr5/2020_year_in_review_part_3_of_my_annual/,1609518348.0,"Hello all, this year in review is something I've been contributing for a few years now. As long as it doesn't break any rules and we continue to get something out of it I would like to make it a bit of a tradition. There was some good advice given to me during last years submission and I've made an effort to clean things up a bit for this year. I love hearing your suggestions.

Here is a link to last year's submission: https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eio3lm/2019_year_in_review_pt_2_of_what_i_hope_to_make/

**Background**

For the last 5 years, at the end of the year I always crunch some numbers to see how our finances look in order to get a complete picture of our path towards financial independence. I add up all of our major assets, subtract all of our debts and come up with our net worth and find the year over year changes.

I then separately add up our retirement assets (essentially net worth subtracting home equity), figure out what our average monthly expenses were(we have tracked every single dollar in and out of our checking account using YNAB since February 2015 https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f83u0y/for_5_years_we_have_tracked_every_single/) and perform some rudimentary calculations to project how many years from being Financially Independent we are.

Note: I actually began tracking all of this in the middle of 2015. So there is a bonus 6 months at the start that can be more or less disregarded for purposes of looking at annual variations.

**2020 Financial Results**

On the whole our path towards Financial independence had a stellar year. Our investments performed great considering the current economic climate and we were able to make all of the tax advantaged contributions that were allowed us(401K/HSA/rIRA x2). This may be the last year we have access to IRA contributions in the full amount.

We really padded out our efund and are at the point where we are a bit cash heavy. Crunching our asset allocation in retirements accounts we are weighted roughly 75% domestic stock, 15% bonds, 10% international stock. Cash makes up slightly more than 10% of our net worth currently.

Our biggest wins this year were continued aggressive pay down of mortgage, continued building of emergency fund, and favourable market returns. The latter being primarily out of our control and so disconnected from what's going on concerns me, but I have no control over it and count my blessings. We also received a modest income increase(wife promoted, yay!) which helped slightly. 

We honestly didn't have any sort of real financial set back to note this year. Everything seemed to go our way in 2020. The only critique that I have is being so cash heavy, although given what 2020 was I'm not sure I would do anything differently.

I see upcoming challenges for next year being thus: 
* Possible loss of ability to contribute to IRAs due to pro-rata rule and income increases
* Reduction in cash position either by opening a brokerage account or more mortgage pay down
* Continued favourable market gains, surely the chickens will come home to roost eventually, maybe 2021 is the year?

    Net Worth Change: ~42% Increase
    Debt Change: ~22% Decrease
    Retirement Change: ~43% Increase
    Expenses Change: ~5% Decrease
    Savings Rate Change ~9% Increase

Final Savings Rate: 71%

Years until FI (change from last year): 6 (-4!)

**Final Thoughts**

We had a very lucky year overall. To not only keep both income streams(with modest increases and stimulus) during the pandemic, but also for markets to return such favourable and strong results was a financial blessing. On the non-financial side, we've both managed to be quite healthy and nobody that we know has really been all too effected by covid. That's what truly counts! 

From the financial standpoint it was mostly just ""steady as she goes"" other than a bit of rebalancing earlier in the year it's all just been on auto pilot. It's surprising to look back and see just how the year played out. I quite enjoy only doing this annually as a check in, automating most of it and trying not to pay any attention to the noise of any given quarter/month/week/day. Perhaps even annually is a bit much?

I'm hoping that next year is more of the same. Continue working, continue investing, and continue aggressive mortgage paydown. I'm going to try and reduce our cash balance a bit in the coming year, I would like it to be around $20k less. Gotta put those dollars to better work, and with conditions as they are now, Ally isn't working them nearly hard enough for my liking! 

I'm hoping that 2021 is a bit of a transitional year for me personally. I would like to focus less on work and more on starting to picture what a post-needing an income life would look like. Over the last few years we've been fortunate enough that I think we're at a point where we can more or less coast and while we can't completely take the foot off the accelerator at least we can maybe begin to stop holding it pinned to the floor and attempting to push it through the floorboards. That's very stressful. Physical and mental health has been rough in 2020 and need to be focused on this year. Beginning to feel old stinks!

94,Estimated Taxes - Annualized Income Tax Method Planning Spreadsheet,,31,ko31bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ko31bb/estimated_taxes_annualized_income_tax_method/,1609466879.0,"Link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJnEcpNJ7N2n5kLwvV6JfGpxrwX_DNfFSAc-j236P98/edit?usp=sharing

Please COPY the spreadsheet and don't request edit access.

Original credit goes to a Bogleheads user TaronM that made the original spreadsheet. I updated his spreadsheet for the Tax Jobs Cuts Act which the original poster wasn't willing to do, which took a lot of work as the annualized income forms changed significantly. 

I updated his spreadsheet as I'm on SSDI income and was wracking my brain trying to estimate taxes correctly for $0 penalties. I'm invested all-in on Hedgefundie's UPRO/TMF portfolio and re-balancing that can throw off significant capital gains every quarter. In one year I'm either $0 federal taxes or paying $40,000 in federal taxes solely due to rebalancing my portfolio. SSDI is tax free with $0 income, and up to 85% taxable otherwise. 

I looked everywhere for an online calculator or software package to spit out numbers and the only thing I found was a ""Please contact us for pricing"" offering. Being too cheap to hire a CPA for this and not wanting to do these forms once a quarter, with the workload of doing a tax return, I decided to do the work once and build upon what TaronM started. 

# Instructions
Make a copy for each new year from the template. 

Put in your tax brackets. I have the single tax brackets, if you're married, you'll have some work to do to put in the married tax brackets. Put your YTD date income for each ""quarter"", the first 3 months of income, the first 5 months of income, the first 8 months of income, then finally in December your total income.  You'll do this 15 days before the estimated taxes are due at each quarter and put your ACTUAL income received. 

Save this spreadsheet and refer to it at tax return time. You'll have to enter the same numbers you estimated in your tax program of choice for the annualized income method. 

You'll probably want to save this spreadsheet for 7 years with your tax return in case you're ever audited to show that you did the worksheet. My spreadsheet puts every number into the worksheet for you. 

Enjoy saving money of having to hire a CPA year round to do the busy work by hand and tell you how much estimated taxes you owe.

Cheers! 

# Limitations
It does no QBI phaseout rules, they're really complex. If you're self employed I trust you're putting in realistic numbers and knows how this QBI phaseout works. My spreadsheet will spit out whatever numbers you put in same as the Annualized Income Method forms itself. I have not tested this part extensively so YMMV on it. Remember: garbage in = garbage out. 

# Disclaimers

I'm not a CPA. I've only tested this for my expected situation of SSDI, ordinary income, dividends, qualified dividends, short term capital gains, and long term capital gains. I've tested this with 2019 tax brackets and a 2019 Tax Act Return. At most TaxAct generates a $1 or $2 penalty, which is a lot better than the $100-$200 in penalties I was facing with my previous attempts to figure out estimated taxes on my own.

# How this spreadsheet applies to FIRE 

We're more likely to retire early, and our income is based off our portfolios, and we may have uneven income in a year (say withdrawing $40k extra from stocks in June to fix a roof.) FIREing doesn't give us much withholding opportunities either - so we're either paying estimated taxes or doing 60-day rollovers of 100% withholding IRA withdrawals. Another poster yesterday was asking how to estimate such taxes and so I decided to post this today! :)",financialindependence

I understand the importance of having an emergency fund in something that won't lose value when your net worth is on the lower end, but what about once you've grown your net worth? If you have **years** worth of expenses invested in something like VTSAX, does it still make sense to keep 3+ months of living expenses in a savings account? 

Even with a market down turn, you'd still have access to several months worth of expenses if you initially had years worth invested.

103,What the pandemic taught us about personal savings,,526,km5ujq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/km5ujq/what_the_pandemic_taught_us_about_personal_savings/,1609211806.0,"Statista Link: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/246268/personal-savings-rate-in-the-united-states-by-month/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246268/personal-savings-rate-in-the-united-states-by-month/)

Obviously there are a number of reasons impacting peoples' ability to save money, but according to the Statista graph linked above, it seems like people have a lot more 'disposable' income than they think. If savings can skyrocket (*nationally*) 26% in a single month, clearly people can save more money *all* the time so they can actually make it for a few months on savings in case of an emergency. I'm not taking away from the suffering that countless people have been forced to endure, but a little bit of preparation likely could have saved (no pun intended) many from some of the tougher things they've had to go through during the pandemic.

I also think this graph is pretty resounding evidence against the argument that most people don't have room in their budgets to put more towards savings. Pandemic or no pandemic, the ability to increase savings so drastically and so quickly says something about where most peoples' money goes. I guess this spike could have been due to the CARES stimulus, but I don't think this is likely the case since I find it hard to believe that an extra $600 could have caused such a large spike in savings for so many Americans (I might just not be in tune with who exactly the 'average' American is though). Hopefully this whole pandemic experience encourages people to re-examine their financial health!",financialindependence

107,Beyond expense ratios and CAGR; why the intangibles of FIRE may matter more than the quantitative factors. My perspective based on ~8 years of early retirement.,,1380,kl4jm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl4jm4/beyond_expense_ratios_and_cagr_why_the/,1609079376.0,"I am submitting this post to promote discussion about what I believe to be potential dangers associated with the pursuit of FIRE and to highlight the importance of, *throughout your life*,  attending to the qualitative factors that I believe are essential to a successful retirement.  My goal is to encourage those of you on the road to FIRE to take whatever steps you deem necessary to avoid these potential pitfalls.  

 I believe that, for some, FIRE becomes some sort of amorphous goal that provides both a degree of hope, *as well as an excuse to avoid working on the aspects of life that really matter*: social connections, meaningful goals, physical and mental health. This is especially true for people who, while highly intelligent and well educated, are relatively less adept at enhancing and developing the qualitative aspects of life.

Some of you may remember me from my previous posts.  Recently I have started to  think more about what accounts for post FIRE happiness, meaning, fulfillment and health.   I believe that, just as it is important to devote X percent of your salary to an IRA throughout your life, it is equally important to devote X percent of your time to physical and mental health, maintaining or rekindling old friendships and cultivating new ones.  Failure to do so puts one at risk for an unfulfilling and unhealthy retirement.  

It's as if some FIRE aspirants are saying to themselves: “Yeah, I’m in poor physical health, depressed and socially isolated and I hate my job.  But that’s ok, because, one day……”.  But then that day comes; you are FI, but with nothing with which to fill the void.  I have seen this before.  Retirement is often accompanied by a huge let down.  Some become depressed and drink.  Some stay at home all day, every day leading to friction with their SO.  Some blow vast amounts of money on baubles in *a vain attempt to find some sort of justification for the decades they had sacrificed to get to this point.*

I am eternally thankful to my parents who were wise enough to facilitate and support my nascent hobbies and passions.  Because of them I had endless things to motivate me when I stopped working.  I am equally aware that my natural tendency to reach out to old friends, work colleagues etc. meant that I had a deep and wide pool of social support when I need it.  Nevertheless, I have struggled with periods of loneliness since I stopped working ~8 years ago, long before I had ever heard of FIRE.  My new girlfriend has both added tremendously to my life and strengthened my understanding of the vital importance of close interpersonal relationships.   

There are lots of young, highly educated people who are generally dissatisfied with the ‘rewards’ of their sacrifices.  They are exhausted by meaningless work, narcissistic supervisors, back stabbing colleagues and no identifiable path to a better work life.  They are left to ask” “Why the f**k did I sacrifice so much?  For this?”      

I suspect that, to varying degrees, most of the people who are aspiring to FIRE are life long hard workers who have, throughout life, been rewarded for delaying gratification and have received accolades for their performance.

Unfortunately, this focus on career progress can lead to a self-reinforcing dynamic if you devote so much of your time and resources to work that you never develop hobbies, you become socially isolated and your physical/mental health declines. 

I imagine that for more than one reader of this subreddit, your first three decades go something like this:  You buckled down in school and got yourself into a solid university.  You moved to one city for undergrad, then a different city for your first job…by the time you are 30 you are likely to be living in a city to which you have few ties, far from home, old friends and family and with little in your life other than work.  Eventually, you become dissatisfied with this life.  If only…..FIRE!  You begin to fantasize about the day when things will be *‘different’*, and you work ever harder so as to hasten the arrival of FI/RE.  This can lead to a dangerous and self reinforcing cycle in which the unrelenting pursuit of FIRE comes with further neglect of the qualitative factors that are playing a significant role in life dissatisfaction.  

FIRE is not a panacea that will address all of the root causes of your dissatisfaction.  That is a much more complex process. Meaning in life, like financial independence, can be compared to tending an orchard.  In both cases is imperative that you nurture your seedlings/trees regularly, over the course of decades and long before you plan to eat the fruit.  If you wait until you are hungry, you are in trouble. I know that this is easier said than done, but just as it is important to begin saving and investing early and well before your planned FIRE date, it is equally important to maintain health, social connections and meaningful, non career activities while you are working towards FI.


**TL;DR** 
The quantitative aspects of FIRE are arguably less important to a successful retirement than the various, and often neglected, qualitative factors. I believe that many FIRE aspirants are so motivated to attain financial independence that they don’t consider the potential negative consequences of pursuing the quantitative aspects of FIRE (e.g., savings rate, CAGR, etc.) *at the expense* of what are potentially more important qualitative factors (i.e. relationships, health, etc).",financialindependence

111,It is possible to have too much in Roth accounts (US-based),,5,kl6u9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl6u9f/it_is_possible_to_have_too_much_in_roth_accounts/,1609087941.0,"This is a PSA that it is possible to have too much in Roth accounts. It’s a somewhat rare occurrence, and there aren’t many blogs or other information about it, so I thought I’d post what I’ve learned and what I’ve done in hopes that it helps someone out there. 

**My primary piece of advice: Once you are >50% to your FI goal, please check to see that your allocations in your accounts are supporting your plan.** Take a look at the Roth conversion ladder, and put pen to paper on how you will withdraw the money you need in your years of retirement. My mistake was blindly putting my savings into Roth, and upon reaching my overall FI number, finding that if I want to utilize the tax benefits of the Roth, my allocation runs out of money for the 10 years before I’m 59.5 (when distributions from Roth are tax-free).

The common FI wisdom to max out retirement accounts first, and pointers to accessing retirement funds early all make the assumption that most of your retirement funds are in pretax accounts. And if you are primarily invested in pretax accounts, this entire post is not going to apply to you. All the conventional FI wisdom applies. This post only applies if you are overweight in Roth, and relatively light in both pretax and taxable accounts. 

I personally got here because I had invested early in Roth accounts, didn’t switch to Traditional until recently, and only really looked at the sum of all my accounts in the progress towards FI until I was about 80% to my goal. Some background, from my first comment with this account:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9i0h5/daily\_fi\_discussion\_thread\_august\_14\_2020/g1hrad5/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9i0h5/daily_fi_discussion_thread_august_14_2020/g1hrad5/?context=3)

Summary is that 2/3 of my investments were in Roth, and assuming I’d hit my number soon, the pretax and taxable buckets didn’t have enough to get me to 59.5 (20+ years from now). At best, using taxable brokerage funds and pulling out Roth contributions will get me through the first 5 years while I spin up the Roth conversion ladder, but then the pretax bucket will dry up in about 5 years, leaving a 10+ year gap until I’d be able to access Roth tax-free.

The alternatives I’d considered included:

* SEPP: One is allowed to set up substantially equal periodic payments from a Roth account, but this sucks for a few reasons. First, it requires careful accounting and compliance from when you start until 59.5. Breaking compliance levies large penalties, so it is rigid and inflexible. If you are one who can stick to the same budget and plan for 20 years, maybe it’s for you, but it isn’t for me. Second, I believe these payments will be taxed as income. Even though it comes from a Roth account, because I would not yet be 59.5, it does not receive the tax-free treatment (and recall, in this scenario, I’ve already pulled out all my contributions). I’ve seen a couple of blog posts that conflict on this, one saying it’s from Roth so it is tax-free, one saying it is taxed as income. In my read of the IRS document, it would be taxed as income prior to 59.5.
* Just take the penalty for early withdrawal: Yes, this is a possibility, but I’d be taxed at income rates, and also 10% as a penalty. Not ideal, and I’d like to avoid if possible. If my Roth were fatFIRE level, I may fold this into the plan. But it’s not at fatFIRE levels nor do I expect it to get there for decades. 

\**If you follow the primary advice, you won’t need the following, but if you find yourself over allocated in Roth like me, the following may be helpful.*\* I also recognize the below are slightly controversial and unintuitive, so if there are things I’m missing that make these suboptimal, I’m all ears. There aren’t many folks writing about this, so it’s not like I’ve had robust discussions on the pros and cons here. 

I still enjoy my job, so I’ve been continuing to accumulate, but I’ve made or am considering the following changes:

1. Stopped my (backdoor) Roth contributions. At the current investment levels in my Roth accounts, it will accrue (over 20+ years) to more than I can spend. So to me, it makes no sense to continue to send money there. 
2. Perhaps even more controversial is that I have made a CARES act withdrawal from my Roth 401k, in order to fund my taxable brokerage account. The CARES act allows families that have been impacted by COVID (my partner received unemployment earlier this year) to withdraw from retirement accounts up to $100K without penalty, but does require that you pay taxes on earnings (for a Roth 401k, they calculate what proportion is contributions and earnings, and you’d pay taxes only on the earnings portion). You can choose to pay the tax burden over 3 years, and you can also choose to pay the sum back to your retirement account within 3 years to levy no tax burden. Like I said before, my Roth totals will grow to more than I can spend, so this made sense for me. And if it turns out to be the wrong move, I can return the money to my retirement account within 3 years, and will at least have jumpstarted my taxable accounts in the meantime. If this sounds interesting to you, note that you would need to execute this before December 31st this year. This operation took me about 30 minutes with my 401k servicer to execute, so there is still time!
3. I am considering pulling out my Roth contributions next year to further enrich my taxable accounts. Again, all in service of shifting growth to support my early retirement, at the expense of funds I would access post 59.5.

A drawback here is that while I may contribute to the Roth in the future, I won’t be able to contribute for any years that have passed. Also, technically, moving funds from Roth to taxable means I’m giving up tax-sheltered space in order to create taxable gains. It sounds like heresy, but it makes sense if your Roth accounts, in combination with the time left until you are 59.5, leave you with more than you’ll ever need.",financialindependence

113,Any accountants in here already FIRE'd or on track?,,620,kkf8u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kkf8u5/any_accountants_in_here_already_fired_or_on_track/,1608970698.0,"Any accountants up in here? Would think by nature of our business that we are the more detailed-oriented ones, especially when it comes to a financial/numbers perspective. Just curious to hear more stories from accountants who are on the FIRE path.

Our career path and titles are pretty standardized so I would think the motions are very similar, but any tips/advice along the way would be great to hear about.

For me personally, I've done the Big 4 route as an auditor and am now in industry as an Accounting Manager. I'm making low six-figures. I live in a HCOL area and my savings rate is about 50%. I'm still in my early 30s with about $600K in net worth. Most of my net worth build was attributed to investing in the S&P 500 and appreciation of the home I currently live in. About half of my net worth is in investments, including 401K and Roth IRA. I max out my traditional 401K and Roth IRA annually, and am hoping to FIRE in my early 50s with about $2.5M. I recently started my own bookkeeping practice as a side hustle in hopes to accelerate that even earlier.

My personal advice echoes what this sub says time and time again, which is that the best time to invest was yesterday and the second best time to invest is today. I wish I wasn't feeling so certain a recession was coming in the 2010s and I know I missed quite a rally in my personal investment accounts by having too much money in cash. Nowadays, I have set up automatic investments of $500 every two weeks into my personal investment account (VFIAX fund), and my only regret is I am not putting more than $500 (still got a good chunk in cash as a safety reserve to hopefully buy a bigger home soon).",financialindependence
114,Purchasing homes and property to rent out is a terrible wealth and cash flow strategy for your future; I want to explain why to everyone.,,0,kl8ygk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl8ygk/purchasing_homes_and_property_to_rent_out_is_a/,1609094958.0,"TLDR provided :) 

First off I want to say that I’m not completely discouraging the purchase of a home. There are hundreds of reasons to buy a reasonable house besides just the money. 

A whole bunch of people think that this purchase and rental method is a smart move, but it involves extreme risk, for minimal reward. 

In addition to this, if anyone would like to see the full amortization breakdown and it’s comparison to typical bond rates in which I derived this data please shoot me a direct with your email and I can send you the excel document I created. This is also a useful tool for comparing or looking at any mortgage or estimating capital gain returns for anyone looking for an easy tool. 

First off I want to talk about home loans. Now I live in Seattle, and a 400-600k house is typically a decent three bed home in this market. I understand that some areas homes are incredibly cheap, but cheap areas exist because the work and rental market in the area has little to no demand, so keep that in mind. 

So for this scenario I’ll talk about a 450k loan with 50k down (although the down payment is irrelevant until we use it as beginning equity for a capital gains comparison) This loan will be at 2.5% over thirty years, the total cost of the home being 500K, and we’ll slash the real estate fees to make things simpler. This is a fantastic interest rate, you probably won’t get it. This will generate roughly a $1800 dollar mortgage payment for 30 years. In total you will pay roughly 200k in interest over the period. That’s 200k over 30 years you will be giving to the bank. What if you pay an additional $1,000 a month towards your mortgage? You still pay 150k in interest. So don’t think that saves you much. 

Home total net loss over 30= ($700,000) (principle and interest) 

Average yearly maintenance loss = ($7500) 

Average tax (1% property value) loss= Variable, but we’ll use the starting low, being a net loss of ($4500) a year for the whole period 

Total net loss over 30= ($700,000) + 30*(($7500)+($4500))= ($1,060,000)

Now let’s say you manage to rent this home for $3500 (nearly twice your mortgage) unfaltering for the 30 year period (which is impossible). Let’s also keep in mind that 500k homes don’t rent for $3500 a month, but I want to be as generous as absolutely possible. 

Net gain, rental over 30= $1,260,000

Total net gain, = (1,060,000) + 1,260,000= 200k 

But we can’t forget the most valuable piece of buying a home, and that’s the fact you own it, and it’s appreciating over the thirty year period. Typical home equity rates in the Seattle market increase by 3-5% a year, compounding we’re looking at about 100-200% increase in home equity value. 

Total net gain= 200k + (500k*200%) 

Total net gain over 30 years purchasing and renting a home with a absolute best case scenario = $1,700,000

Sounds great right? Why not take a loan on six homes and rent them out? Lots of geniuses did this before 08’ and there are more of them doing it now. These people don’t understand non-liquid assets like homes, and just how risky it is to overextend on the loans. If the market crashes, or demand is lost, you’re now paying for multiple mortgages with absolutely nothing to save you. All your savings will be gone in months, you’ll be forced to short sell to the bank, and you’ll lose your absolute ass. Let’s also mention how much time it takes to manage and get tenants, we’re talking thousands on thousands of hours of your time. 



So now let’s talk about liquid capital gains, or just the most basic low risk version of them. Typical mutual funds generate 5-15% a year, but we’re not going to compare this home rental strategy to mutuals, we are going to compare them to literally government T-Bonds. On average we’re looking at about 1.6% a year returns on these. Anyone that knows anything about investment can tell you that 1.6% a year is terrible. But that just goes to show how shit buying homes to rent out truly is. 

So what happens if you put the same amount of money that you would put into the home, into government T-Bonds? This is a liquid, little to no risk, no time asset. You just deposit your money every month, year, whatever, click out of your internet browser and go to bed. This is huge, you should always value your time as much as possible. 

So starting with 50k equity, if you put the same amount into T-Bonds every year as you would have the home, after thirty years you will have: 

Where $24,000= yearly cost of home mortgage
Where $12,000= yearly cost of tax and home maintenance; 
Where n= year since original investment

Y1= (50,000+$24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

Yn= (Yn-1 + $24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

If n=30, Total net value of investment value = $1,460,000. 

So when compared on paper to T-Bonds, the home rental option beats it by about 240k, but that is only under the most exceptional, unreadable, and perfect circumstances which again, are: 

1) The housing market continues at its current rate for the next 30 years 
2) There is never a month you pay a mortgage payment without rental income from the respective house 
3) You have a fixed interest rate at 2.5% 
4) You pay no real estate fees
5) it takes no personal work time to maintain the homes and tenants 

These five things are completely impossible, in other words, I’m comparing the absolute best housing scenario, with the absolute lowest return average investment scenario. This means that if you can pull a measly 1.6% a year from T-Bonds you will take on nearly no risk, and still make nearly the same amount of money you would buying and renting out homes. So don’t overextend on home loans, cause if things go to shit, so will your life. 

TLDR; Buying and renting out homes is a horrible, high risk wealth strategy, and some of the worst average return bonds and mutual funds will absolutely crush it with no effort over a 30YR period.",financialindependence

116,"I don't give people money anymore, now I only give advice",,370,kk2k3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kk2k3j/i_dont_give_people_money_anymore_now_i_only_give/,1608917127.0,"Merry Christmas. Thinking back on previous Christmases where I knew people fighting with their family and friends wanting money they made, I remembered a [comment I read in this sub about how to deal with that](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jfpl1o/being_stealth_when_people_know_your_job_titles) that I've also done as well:

> My mom would offer to help anyone in the family by offering a financial advice and if they would give her complete and full control over their finances, she would guarantee that she could help them save more money to afford the things that they want. Problem is, once she starts saying that you can't afford this and that and this and that, they all of a sudden don't need her financial help anymore and can figure it out on their own. They've also stopped asking for money from my parents since the ""help"" offered is tightening their budget instead of hers.

This is because just giving people money doesn't really help them understand how that money was gotten and why it's being given. You hear a lot of parables about this, like teaching someone to fish than giving them fish. This is due to [Economic Outpatient Care mentioned in the book Millionaire Next Door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door#Economic_Outpatient_Care):

> Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. Besides offspring observations resulting in Under Achievers of Wealth (UAW) children, EOC is a contributing factor to the passing on of the UAW belief. **Offspring who receive EOC have 98% of the annual income compared to their counterparts who are not recipients of EOC. In comparison, they also have 57% of the net worth.** EOC gives recipients a false sense of financial security. For this reason they purchase homes in upscale neighborhoods that exceed the recommended value according to their incomes. Thirty percent of American families live in homes valued at $300,000, yet only earn an annual income of $60,000.These homes then demand nice cars for the driveway, nice furniture for the living room, and a nice plasma TV to complement the furniture. These offspring also purchase and consume the EOC rather than invest it. If a dose of EOC is given on a regular basis, the EOC can actually be absorbed into the individual’s perceived annual income. Expenditures are then calculated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled dose of EOC.

In other words, giving money to people makes them less likely to try on their own. It just feels better in the short term but hurts them in the long term. I used to give out money initially but I curbed that and only started giving advice from then on.

A note about advice though, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. People don't really want to tighten their own living situation and make sacrifices, as you see in the [/r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence) thread above, they just want your money for free. I've told many people about basic financial advice and they just don't want to implement it. I tried to convince them in the beginning but now I just say, suit yourself. If I'm rich in a decade and you just spent it all on stuff, I'm honestly not sure what to tell you. I suppose in rare situations you can give money, but in my experience it never ended well.",financialindependence

119,Rethinking the increase of bonds in your portfolio as your NW increases,,65,kjiajc,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kjiajc/rethinking_the_increase_of_bonds_in_your/,1608827742.0,"So the standard advice for the equity / bond mixture is to increase bonds as you near retirement or another event where you have planned withdrawals.  It's reasonable advice in general based on volatility alone between the two asset classes and the tactic's main purpose is to avoid selling stocks when they're depressed.

However, if we pay attention to the part about **expenses**, this advice seems less relevant since your expenses doesn't scale 1:1 as your NW increases.   Jeff Bezos for example wasn't waiting for his NW to increase whether or not to buy a bigger yacht or island.  

Back to us regular folks...

Assume you start your retirement with a portfolio of $6MM and the you've been advised to have 10% of your NW in bonds/cash.  If you expected to have a $10k/mo spend in retirement and have $600k in your favorite bond or cash equivalents, you can ride out any stock slump for 5 years. 

The standard mixture of bonds is typically higher than 10%.

Assuming you're satisfied with this duration for any type of equity market recovery, why would you crank up the percentage of bonds in your portfolio in retirement just because your portfolio's percentage warrants you have more than $600k in bonds?

I already max my own traditional 401k plus megabackdoor and backdoor Roth contributions. My non-working spouse has 145k in an IRA (rolled over years ago from a 401k at her prior job -- we regret rolling over to the IRA now). I'd like to make spousal backdoor Roth IRA contributions for her. How to do this while avoiding the pro rata rule?

As I understand it, if my spouse rolls over her IRA into a 401k or Solo 401k, I should also be able to make spousal IRA contributions for her, and avoid taxes when converting those contributions to a Roth IRA.

The question is: what tactics can we use to roll over her IRA to a 401k to ""wipe the slate clean"" and avoid the pro rata rule when making backdoor Roth contributions?

Sure, she could get a ""corporate job"" with a traditional 401k and roll over into that. But we are not interested in doing that now (she is a SAHM for our three young kids).

Could she create a Solo 401k with minimal self-employment income (from surveys, eBay, etsy, whatever) and roll her IRA into that?

Has anyone actually gone to the effort of ""manufacturing"" self-employment income with the main motivating purpose being to open a Solo 401k?  If so, was it worth the effort for an additional 6k Roth contributions per year?

Any particular recommendations for Solo 401k providers?

Recently came across a blog site looking at Sustainable Withdrawal Rates (SWR), and the proportion of equity:bonds in investments over time (https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/11/09/what-is-wrong-with-target-date-funds/)

The argument is that the conventional rule of thumb as I understand it (i.e reducing equity:bond ratio with age) is not as an effective strategy compared to a ""bond tent"" (i.e. shift more into bonds before retirement as normal, but then quickly shift out of bonds again, to 80 or 100% equity, in retirement).

Has anyone come across this, or uses this themselves? I would love to know the community's opinion. 

Many thanks.

Me and everyone I know has been stuck in perpetual poverty our whole lives. I articulate myself, and I suppose I’m fairly clever. But as far as knowledge on how to make money work for me, healthy work patterns, wealth building habits, and financial literacy I have none. 

Many people born in my situation never put effort into anything. I’ve been reading books, trying to save money, seeking mentors/apprenticeships/resources since I was 13 (I’m 23 now). 

I’m at a loss. I’m traumatized, so it’s hard for me to trust. I don’t have transportation, or a house. I have ONE living family member who has Schizophrenia. I haven’t been homeless, but I’ve been staying in a friends laundry room for 2 months. There’s always a factor that comes up in my life that prevents security. 

What do you do to build ANY type of consistency for yourself when you:

1.) Don’t have a car or license 
2.) Don’t have a house
3.) Don’t have financial literacy
4.) Don’t have a degree 
5.)Don’t have a computer (I have a phone). 
6.) Are Black with one face tattoo
7.) Have aspergers Syndrom (I also have aspergers, though I am high functioning)

9.) I don’t have any felonies luckily. The face tattoo is from a time when I had to do dirt for survival at 16 years old, and I haven’t been in the streets for over 7 years. 

Any advice is good. I wish I was anyone else daily. I’ve been asking this same question for months. In the mean time I’ve been doing odd jobs to save money, but cost of living vs money I’m making doesn’t add up. When I say I’m smart, and a good addition to a team I mean it.

126,Thoughts on buy and hold on margin at 2.5% interest rate,,45,kij30u,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kij30u/thoughts_on_buy_and_hold_on_margin_at_25_interest/,1608687037.0,"Very interested in this community's thoughts on buying and holding a position in BRK.B now that margin rates have dropped at Robinhood from 5% to 2.5%. I expect a negative reaction, and even some quotes of Warren Buffett saying not to invest with margin. But I'm adding this post because there are some inherent advantages of pursuing FIRE that I think could make a small dose of this strategy a way to accelerate time to FI. For someone with no debt, a high savings rate, and an existing balance in a taxable account that I don't intend to withdraw any time soon, I'm wondering about the financial risks this position would expose me to.

Using round numbers here's an example:

\- Current account balance of $150,000 invested 100% between 4 individual stocks
- Margin allowance of +$125,000
- Invest $30,000 on margin in BRK.B indefinitely, no trading, no options, just buy and hold
- Total invested amount: $180,000
- Maintenance margin: $80,000 (MM is the amount of capital required in the account before needing to deposit more cash).

I understand this magnifies risk and increases downside in a down market. The goal would not be to take advantage of all of the leverage available, both to reduce risk of a margin call and increase the sleep at night factor.

**Upside:**  
\- Pretty simple, if BRK.B can grow more than 2.7% per year (2.5% interest plus $60/year for Gold membership), I come out ahead financially. This isn't a very high bar.

**Risks:**  
\- BRK.B falling precipitously along with all other stocks in the portfolio. The holdings would need to collectively fall by 55% in order to go to a maintenance margin situation. This could happen due to systematic risk (e.g. recession) or unsystematic risk (Warren Buffett passing away). I think these risks are somewhat mitigated by the margin of safety Berkshire enjoys, $100b in cash, and commitment to buy back shares.  
\- Margin rate increasing at Robinhood. If the interest rate increases, the hurdle rate is higher.  
\- Emotional attachment. Investing borrowed money could increase stress without discipline, and that has it's own cost even if I come out ahead financially.  
\- Getting greedy if this works near term, overextending to use additional leverage, and then encountering large losses

Again I don't expect positive reviews but I want them to be a little more reasoned than ""DON'T DO IT!"" What am I missing here? Has anyone else pursuing FIRE done this? How is this different from, for instance, keeping $30,000 in your mortgage at 2.5% interest rate while having $30,000 invested in a stock?

127,5 Years of Earning and Spending/Savings from Military Officer and Non-Profit Worker,,58,ki7mv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ki7mv7/5_years_of_earning_and_spendingsavings_from/,1608651538.0,"Hello,

We've been tracking our family's income and spending very diligently for 5 years now and wanted to share what that [looks like](https://imgur.com/a/PKhsV2v).

Background on us:

34M and 31F working in the US military and in a non-profit organization.  We have one child, hoping for more in the future.

I (34M), have always been a big saver and my wife has always been very responsible with money.  I found the FIRE community about the same time that we got married and the two events dovetailed well.  We have been boosting our savings rate over the past 5 years thanks to some lessons learned from this community.

Before I learned about the FIRE community, I was saving money because it seemed smart but did not have an end goal in mind, or really any idea on how much savings I actually needed.  We've developed a clearly defined goal over the past few years.  We are aiming for \~$100k in passive income when I retire from the military.  Roughly $47k of that will come from a military pension and the rest will come from our investments with a 3.25% WR.  We also want to be able to fully fund college for two kids at the in-state public university level.

Aside from really honing in on our retirement goals, the biggest development in the last few years has been tax minimization awareness.  We've paid way more in taxes than we needed to for the first 4 years.  But I finally figured it out this time around and we are using tax deferred savings to avoid the 22% tax bracket and actually do some tax gain harvesting to the tune of \~$20k this year.  In the military you usually hear the ""use Roth because part of your pay isn't taxed"" mantra.  This makes sense for a lot of folks, but I realized that 22% marginal tax rate is still a 22% marginal tax rate regardless of what career you're in.  So moving forward we will continue to use tax deferred savings to the max extent to avoid the 22% rate.

The use of tax deferred savings really helped this year as I also spent a significant amount of the year in a combat zone, resulting in tax free income.  We saved over $100k of our earned income and we will end up paying $3,800 of income tax on $210,000 of total income this year ($180k earned and $30k in capital gains/dividends).  That won't be repeatable in normal years but at least we can avoid some of the 22% bracket.

Hope this was entertaining/useful.",financialindependence

This leaves out one important thing: They *had* money to put into the market on the way down. If so, that also means they didn't have that money in the market *on the way up*.

Once you have your allocation set (e.g. 80% stocks / 10% bonds / 10% cash), you should stick to that allocation. Sacrificing your cash position (or worse, your emergency fund) to buy more stocks could work out well, but it could be a disaster too. And if you had extra cash just sitting around that was available to buy stocks, then you almost certainly missed the chance to use that cash in the run-up before the drop.

Don't time the market. Choose your allocation and stick to it. Dollar Cost Averaging is fine, but that should be an automatic process that is independent of what the market is doing.",financialindependence

""No worries just have parents give you $500K seed money at 18!""

Look, anyone in their early 30s who reached FI did via 3 ways or a combination of the 3

1. Lots of risk (Invested $20,000 in TSLA at IPO which turned into $2 million)
2. High income/high savings rate (Amazon dev @ 22 earning $150K + $150K stock options)
3. Luck (born into wealthy parents/seeder money given from parents/business that sold for milions\*)

\*Combination of luck, hardwork, great timing

&#x200B;

And none, I assure you, none of the 3 are easily replicated. If it was that **easy**, EVERYONE would be FI in their 30s.

So let's just stop hating on anyone who is FI in their 30s and accept that they did it via some combination of the 3.",financialindependence

138,"Who is planning to leave little to no estate, and how has that affected your FIRE number/planning?",,74,kg7k3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kg7k3b/who_is_planning_to_leave_little_to_no_estate_and/,1608383842.0,"I'm currently single with no kids, mid-30's. I'll collect a modest pension around age 50 and plan to have maybe 5-600k in savings by age 65. My plan is to buy indexed annuities at that time with my non-registered funds, which when combined with my pension should be enough for a comfortable retirement (a little under 4k/mo CAD). I also own my parents house and will live in the granny suite once they pass, renting the rest of the house to cover costs. CCP and OAS (Canadian Social Security) will be delayed to 70 to get the max payment.

I know annuities get a bad rap here but here's the benefits I see:

- simplicity, no calculation of SWR, no complicated tax planning, no asset balancing.
- very safe. At least in Canada, annuity plans have pooled insurance guaranteed by the government; about as safe as you can get.
-  guaranteed income no matter how long I live: I could live to 108 (like one of my great grandparents) and not worry about running out of money).
- higher SWR. With self managed funds I was planning a conservative 3.25% SWR. Annuities would pay 4-5%.
- protects your money from declining cognitive function, age related scams, greedy relatives.
- maybe more tax efficient, as prescribed annuities are considered to be mostly ROC (annecdotal, need to do more research)

Downsides:
- money is gone when I am
- inflexibility, can't withdraw a lump sum of needed
- some inflation risk, if inflation is higher than 2%.

My house will be left to my estate, but that's about it. As I won't have to worry about funding my retirement once the annuities are purchased, I can afford to be generous with my money while I am alive.

Of course my personal situation and annuity rates may be dramatically different in 30 years, but I won't be buying annuities until age 65 so I have plenty of time to adjust course. Even if I have kids though, I feel like a paid education and maybe help with a house downpayment is all they should expect to get.",financialindependence
139,"Hit $1,000,000 NW at 33(m). Slow and steady.

I’ve been a long-time lurker here since I discovered FIRE back in 2014, but I’ve rarely posted. I hit $1 million earlier this year, and I wanted to share my story and hopefully exchange some valuable insights with you. It has taken me a while to work up the courage to share, but here goes. I’ll try to keep it fairly short and simple, although I apologize in advance for the long Background section, and I’ll follow up with more details as they come up in the discussion.


***TL;DR: I’m 34, single, watch collector, no children (and don’t plan on having any if I can help it). My NW reached ~$1 million at the end of August 2020. I increased my liquid net worth from zero to $850,000 in 6.5 years, and I aim to reach my FI number of $2.5 million by age 41. I don’t hate my job, but I do hate that it keeps me from staying fit and active, so the sooner I become FI the better. Look at my charts. Ask me questions or for more charts. Thank you for reading!***


**Background**

I grew up middle class in a developing country (Middle East) as an only child. I was privileged to have parents who were more than willing to forego most pleasures in life—including travel, nicer cars, etc.—and to instead spend every penny they had to make sure I received the best education possible. They put me in a private American school and paid for my college education, but they also were not the absolute savviest with money.

My health and education came first for my parents, but what came a very close second was every little whim and desire I had as a child—they spoiled me. They almost never invested, and instead spent all their extra money on whatever clothes, computers, videogames, music CDs, cameras or extra pocket money I wanted as a teenager. They found it very hard to say no to me. Because of this I grew up not knowing or appreciating the value of money, and by the time they (involuntarily) retired in their 50s they had virtually no savings.

What’s done is done, right? By the time I woke up to all this in 2013, I was 26 years old and armed with a pretty good education, but I hadn’t exactly been all that successful since graduating in 2008. I had gotten my CPA back in 2009 and was working at a public accounting firm making a measly $12,000/year (yes, that low, because developing country).

I hated my job, mainly because of the people I worked with, but I won’t get into that in any great detail. There was just a big gap between the way I had learned to work in a private/American education and the way I had to work ‘out in the real world’. I also had not been promoted in several years because I was seen by my peers and supervisors as a poor team player.

**Anyway, in early 2014, everything changed!** Thanks to the way my education and career start looked on paper—and thanks to LinkedIn Premium which I was (and still am) paying $30/month for—I was headhunted for a financial controller position in an east African country. This of course meant leaving my family, my city and my friends, and starting all over. To me this was all very new and scary, but it was almost a complete no-brainer. The move was to propel me from $12,000/year to $75,000/year + all the benefits that come with an expat position.

One thing that made it even easier for me to work abroad was my U.S. citizenship, which I got from my father’s side of my family. Anyway, I packed everything that mattered to me in a few suitcases and got on a one-way flight. My liquid net worth was negative at the time; I had $25,000 worth of credit card debt, plus more owed to my parents. I paid it all off within a few months of moving, but my parents later refused to let me pay them back what they’d contributed for an apartment back in my hometown. The apartment cost about $115,0000 and they’d paid for half of it. I still own it.

Since I made that move in 2014, I have made two more moves to other countries, and I’ve grown to quite enjoy my job and responsibilities. I’ve been promoted three times, and each promotion or move has come with a salary bump. I am now a CFO and my income has steadily climbed from the $75,000 in 2014 to $110,000 now in 2020. In addition to that, I get a ~30% performance-based bonus, and a 6% retirement benefit, plus company-paid housing, furniture, utilities, car, gas, internet, phone, house help, gardener, and two flight tickets home per year.

I’m fairly happy with how I’ve done over the past 6 years, but I look back and I still think to myself: What if I hadn’t been so spoiled? What if I’d learned the value of money earlier in life? What if I’d saved my money and started investing at the age of 21 instead of 27? Where would I be now?


**Current financial position**

I have an insane Excel spread sheet I’ve been developing and using for the last 6 years. I track every dollar I make or spend, every stock I buy, and hundreds of metrics. I do it religiously, and it’s made it very easy to pull numbers out to share with you guys.

In [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/tUgIRIN), my total net worth over time is in orange, and my liquid net worth is in black. The green line is my stock portfolio.

[This table](https://imgur.com/ny564mj) breaks down my current net worth near the end of 2020 and each of the previous 6 years. I’ve kept things pretty simple and my stocks are split between two individual accounts with two brokerages—there’s no 401k or IRA of any kind. As a U.S. citizen with no home base in the U.S., I get to exclude much of my income under the FEIE rule, but it also means I can’t contribute anything to a tax-advantaged account.

***EDIT: Several of you have pointed out an error I've made in the original chart and table. I erroneously included in my illiquid net worth (from 2014 to 2016) a separate property that my parents owned until 2016. I was tracking the value of that property in my spreadsheet before it was sold in 2016, but it was never a part of my own net worth and it shouldn't have made its way into the table and chart.***

***I've updated the [table](https://imgur.com/a/Dr2n09G) and [chart](https://imgur.com/a/KTdZoDH). Thanks for pointing out this error!***

These are currently my 6 largest stock positions:

|**Stock**|**% Gain**|**Value**|
:--|--:|--:|
|**TSLA**|+411%|$ 100,400|
|**NFLX**|+43%|$ 79,800|
|**AAPL**|+51%|$ 77,000|
|**FB**|+281%|$ 61,200|
|**AMZN**|+104%|$ 48,100|
|**MSFT**|+62%|$ 39,300|
 
[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/RYsIKmP) shows my income and how much of it I have spent/saved since 2014. I had a particularly low savings rate in 2016 and 2017 because in those years I pursued (and paid mostly out of pocket for) an expensive top 20 MBA degree. I find out more and more every day that this degree is (and will probably continue to be) completely useless to me, and that the ~$85,000 I spent on it would have been much better invested in the market. My CPA is what I need for my job, and my company never cared whether I got an MBA degree.

You can also see evidence of a fair amount of lifestyle creep between 2018 and 2020 in the chart below. In some years I travelled more than others, but generally my living expenses now hover around the $25,000/year mark.

I’ve also been very fortunate to have invested during the recent insane bull run, and [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/gNgO1wn) shows just how much it has helped my net worth over the last couple of years.

You can see in the chart that as of now near the end of 2020, I have invested a total of $300,000 into the stock market, and my portfolio’s estimated value at 12/31/2020 is $680,600. This makes for a total return of 121%, and I’ve calculated an annualized return of over 50% based on the timings of each of my deposits into the brokerage account.


**The way forward**

I feel that I’ve had a great deal of success over the past years, and I attribute most of it to a great ability to save thanks to the way my compensation has been structured and the FEIE. I do, however, recognize that the current market conditions which have allowed my net worth to climb as rapidly as I show in the table below will not necessarily last.

|Year|Net Worth||
:--|--:|:--|
|2014| 248,300||
|2015| 309,400|+25%|
|2016| 252,600|-18%*|
|2017| 379,700|+50%|
|2018| 457,100|+20%|
|2019| 676,000|+48%|
|2020| 1,071,000|+58%|
**Large decrease in NW due to severe drop in Dollar value of property valued in a foreign currency which suffered severe valuation in that year.*

I’ve calculated my FI number at $2,500,000, which I believe would allow me to live comfortably and be able to spend up to $80,000/year in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Based on my current and expected future salary, as well as my expected future savings rate. I’ve also calculated that I can likely achieve my FI number at age 41. Some of my assumptions include a 49-year retirement, average inflation of 2.6%, an annual contribution to my investments of $110,000 (adjusted for inflation), pre-retirement market return of 7%, post-retirement market return of 6%, fixed income return of 5.5%, percent in equities is 110-age (so it changes every year), and annual expenses of $80,000, which decline by 2%/year after age 65.

I guess one other thing I'm grateful for is that I'm not stuck in a loop trying (and failing) to get rich quick like I see some of my friends doing. I'm glad I'm taking the slow and steady path, and that I have the patience and discipline for it.

I’m very happy to get into discussions and answer questions. There are many more charts, calculations and concepts I’d love to discuss and share. The only things I do not want to be asked are 1) what countries I’ve lived/worked in, and 2) what companies I’ve worked for. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to read my story, and I’d love to hear your comments!

EDIT 2: Thank you to everyone who has read my post and engaged in a meaningful exchange with me. Whether we agreed or not, I appreciated the discussion. And thank you, strangers, for the wholesome awards!",financialindependence

141,"I created a little calculator to figure out exactly what my 401k contribution election should be to front load it early each year, reach the annual max, and still get the full employer match.",,86,kfpzys,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kfpzys/i_created_a_little_calculator_to_figure_out/,1608314064.0,"I’ve always tried to “front load” my 401k contributions to reach the annual limit. By that I mean contributing comparatively more early in each year for about 3 months to get more money in the market sooner, and then dropping the contribution election down for the rest of the year.

The problem is trying to calculate exactly what the contributions should be for each month was always a headache and was usually more of an educated guess than a reliable calculation. The reason it gets complicated is because with most employers, you don’t want to reach the annual max prematurely during the year because then if you stop contributing, you lose the employer match for the rest of the year. That is, most employers will only offer the match on paychecks from which you also made a contribution, so you need to contribute from *every* paycheck each year. So it’s usually a bit of guessing and shooting a moving target trying to maximize your contributions, reaching the limit, while still maintaining the employer match through the end of the year.

After not being able to find any calculator or formula online for what I was looking for, I decided to sit down and create my own. This calculator tells you what percentage to set your contribution election at to “load” your 401k as much as possible over a time period you specify, e.g. 3 months. After that “loading period” you’ll drop your contribution election to the minimum required for your employer match, which will continue through the rest of the year while staying below or at the annual contribution limit. Even if you don’t want to front load, input 12 months and the calculator will tell you exactly what your contribution election should be to reach the maximum annual contribution.

This is the first iteration. I’m neither an Excel wizard nor a designer, so I’m sure this spreadsheet can easily be improved and can be made more visually appealing. It’s not perfect and it’s pretty crude, but it seems to get the job done for what I wanted out of it. Hopefully you find it useful. If you have any suggestions for obvious improvements, drop a comment and I’ll look into adding it. Click the links below for direct download.

Hello everyone, I've been following this subreddit for almost 2 years and recently hit a milestone I wouldn't have reached this early if it wasn't for all of you. I wanted to give my thanks, as well as show you how I ended up where I am for anyone interested in reading. 

Current financial breakdown: 

- Checking Account: $3201.89
- Savings Account: $19,199.92
- Investment/Retirement Accounts:$78,736.47 

TOTAL: $101,138.28


2016 ($14k NW end of year) 

[June]  - Just graduated from highschool and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. With college application deadlines coming to an end very soon, and having my teachers, guidance counselors, and parents rush me to make up my mind, I randomly decided to take an accounting major in college because I heard it was in demand. 

[September] - Began my first year of college as well as maintaining 30+ hours at the grocery store I was working at throughout highschool. 

2017 ($31k NW end of year) 

[February] - First semester of college was coming to an end and I was completely miserable. The work was not difficult, the load was not too much for me, but deep in my stomach it just felt so wrong. I knew it wasn't for me and I began showing symptoms of depression because of it that even my close friends began to notice 

[April] - After 2 more months of feeling unmotivated and depressed I decided to pull the plug and drop out. I had no plan B, it was a spur of the moment decision and it felt like the 1000lbs I was carrying on my shoulders was finally gone. 

[June] - Spent the last 2 months working at the grocery store full time and my parents were fed up. We we're arguing every day because of my decision to drop out and after a heated argument they kicked me out the house at 19 years old. 

[July] - Spent 2 weeks with a friend while looking for a place. Ended up finding a basement apartment for cheap and moved in. I knew the minimum wage grocery store job wasn't going to cut it so I found an ad for a construction labourer position paying slightly higher ($35k/yr) and got hired. I spent the rest of the year slaving away and saving every penny I could. I was living VERY cheaply 

2018 ($46k NW end of year) 

(June) - After almost a year of working my ass off, starting earlier then everyone, staying later then everyone, coming in on the weekends to sweep and clean up, the company owner began to be very fond of me and gave me the position of Lead Labourer. This new position almost doubled my income, putting me at $60k/yr. Although the massive pay increase tempted me to splurge, I continued living as if I was still making $35k, and dumped all the extra money into my investment accounts. 

2019 ($72k NW end of year) 

(January - December) - This year not much changed. I was working the same job and still living in the same basement apartment alone. I continued living extremely frugally and was focusing on adding as much money to my investment accounts as possible, even if that meant sacrificing things I really wanted. 

2020 (101K NW end of year) 

(March) - Bought a car for $11k as a birthday gift to myself as I was tired of taking the bus. 

(April) - COVID hit, but thankfully I was able to continue working, most weeks actually working more hours then usual. 

(September) Been working consistently the whole year with no breaks or shutting down due to the virus. The same company owner that gave me a promotion in 2018 asked me if I'd like to train to become a crane operator and I gladly accepted. My wage will remain the same, but once I'm fully certified in about 3 - 4 years I can expect $120k/yr. 

(December) - Just deposited the cheque that puts me at $101k NW! Thank you all for the motivation!",financialindependence

146,Rethinking the 15 year mortgage for FIRE,,566,kendbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kendbq/rethinking_the_15_year_mortgage_for_fire/,1608169456.0,"My FIRE date is now about 7-10 years away. I'm considering a $320k mortgage on a $400k listed home after a 20% down payment on a home. I have two quotes, a 15 year @ 2% and a 30 year at 2.5%. (Moving from Bay Area to L/MCOL area.)

The 2% 15 year is $2,059/mo. A 2.5% 30 year is $1,264. My income is $15k/mo after taxes, so both are extremely easy affordable. 

I'll look at a FIRE date of 10 years and a typical FIRE date of 15 years. 

Normally I'm an ""invest the difference"" kind of guy. It should be easy to find an investment that yields more than 2.5%, right? However, the 15 year is so cheap in monthly payment too, which quite frankly, is rare. It's tempting me. The $1,264/mo payment stream at a 3% SWR is $505,600 nominal to avoid sequence of returns risk. That is a lot of portfolio to carry around that investing the difference may not overcome. 

Investing the difference may or may not pay off either - I'll be using cherrypicked dates and investing in 100% stocks in  VFINX - Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. (For today - why invest in 1.5% bonds when you have a 2-2.5% mortgage to tackle?).

2000 - 15 years later: $272,352

# Lots of Math figuring out after-tax payoff values
Under the worst case year 2000 stock market case we're at:        
238,606.83 30 year payoff - ((98,854-95400) *.85 + 95400)= 140,270.93.    
117,483.53 15-year payoff -140,270.93 = -22,787.4 worse than the 15 year mortgage.         

Year 2002: $119,809.73 payoff after taxes, -2,326.2 worse than the 15-year mortgage - break even.
Year 1985: $76,971.43 payoff after taxes,  $40,512.1 BETTER than the 15-year mortgage.  

All 3 portfolios have returned higher than the year 15 payoff. I'll just focus on the worst case and see if the taxes can possibly change the result:

238,606.83 - ((272,352 -143,100) *.85 + 143,100) = -14,357.37 payoff amount (credit). We're AHEAD $14,357 by investing the difference.

# TL;DR

Invest the difference 10 years - 1985 start date - Huge winner         
Invest the difference 10 years - 2000 start date  - Huge loser            
Invest the difference 10 years - 2002 start date  - Breakeven      

Invest the difference 15 years - 1985 start date - WINNER CHICKEN DINNER - SWR hit         
Invest the difference 15 years - 2000 start date  - Winner         
Invest the difference 15 years - 2002 start date  - Winner         

A 15 year mortgage really warrants consideration if it's affordable, and your FIRE date is under 10 years. If given enough time, yes, it is mathematically advantageous to invest in the difference, but the shorter you're desiring a paid off house before your FI date to avoid a much higher SWR requirement, the more advantageous the 15 year becomes compared to the short-term possible riskiness of the stock market (or buying the $400k house in cash vs keeping a $505k portfolio invested in SWR terms).

Going through this exercise made me re-think the 15 year mortgage for my FIRE goals.",financialindependence

148,Is The Munger Threshold Commonly Tracked?,,422,ke6ltj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ke6ltj/is_the_munger_threshold_commonly_tracked/,1608113372.0,"I enjoy all the spreadsheets and random financial statistics tracked and shared here. This sub seems to be about the only place on the planet where enthusiasm for tracking such things as 4%, fatfire, leanfire, coastfire, and networth numbers is normal.

For some time I have been tracking a statistic which I thought was useless and uninteresting. I never knew what to call the number nor did I have any useful rationale for tracking the number. However to my amusement, I was surprised to hear none other than investing great Charlie Munger refer to the same statistic in his recent CalTech Interview.

Does r/financialindependence/ already have a name for this number? If not, I propose to honor one of investing greats and dub it  ***The Munger Threshold…***

**Munger Threshold**

noun:

the amount of working time between your first working day earning income and the date on which your networth exceeds your cumulative earned income.

example:

Mr. Munger's. **Munger Threshold** was 13 years. You can hear him tell the story at the link below. Mr. Munger had an ""army of children to feed"" and this responsibility caused him to work in the family law practice. After 13 years working and squirreling away savings he discovered his investment portfolio exceeded the total of his earned law income. Therefore, Charley Munger's **Munger Threshold** was 13 years.

calculation:

munger threshold = munger date - first working day

related:

munger ratio = Networth/Cumulative Lifetime Earned Income

munger date = the date on which Munger Ratio = 1

It's also a post for seeking any advice that you think I could possibly use, and to formally document the start of my FI journey.And maybe even help someone who finds themselves in a similar position as me.

\[CROSS POST\] I have posted this in a few other subreddits.  I was told by a commenter that  I would get more constructive feedback here. If this is not allowed then please remove it. I'm new to reddit and still figuring things out.

**TL;DR**

* Started an Amazon Publishing Business back in 2016 that became *wildly* successful in a very short time period, earning upwards of $50K on our best month. Foolishly decided to travel the world with my fiancé and become a *""Digital Nomad""*, living extravagantly in a different city every 2-3 months. Had a blast but didn't save a penny and spent pretty much everything, every month all while slowly neglecting our business - the only source of income we had.
* At the age of 31 (fiancé 29), I've got $6k to my name with hardly any income (*our main Amazon account recently got shut down)* and my fiancé and I are now living at my Moms place back home in South Africa. *\*sigh\*.*
* Now on a mission to reach FI and fully committed to do *whatever it takes* to get there.

After receiving a decent amount of hate on my previous posts I thought I'd add disclaimers to those that read further.

\[DISCLAIMER 1\] The amounts are not exact, just as I remember them - but they are close enough. If I write a blog one day and enough people are interested I will dig into my bank statements, get exact amounts and post the screenshots of my biggest months/biggest expenses.

\[DISCLAIMER 2\] This is no way a bash on Digital Nomads or the lifestyle in general. It works and is possible, if you are intelligent and do it right. I was just dumb. Period.

**\*\*\*Scroll to the bottom of this post to if you would like to see my questions and have no interest in  reading my** ***""sex, drugs rock and roll""*** **story.\*\*\***

Time to swallow my pride. This is going to be a very embarrassing post for me, but I feel like I need to share it and get a *real with myself*. To put everything on the table, and also get a kick in the ass from this community with some added accountability - and hopefully advice from those who have achieved FI and have had similar experiences.

The last 4 years of my life has been a fun, wild and very expensive ride - one filled with lots of amazing moments, but also filled with insanely stupid financial decisions.

I'll start from 2016, Just before I decided to start my online business. My story began like many others do. I was working a low paying job in my home country of South Africa and wasn't entirely happy, ditto for my girlfriend *(now fiancé).*

I didn't quite hate it but I definitely was not fulfilled or earning the kind of money that I wanted. I got the taste of travel from when I took a gap year after university in 2013, and from then on I knew that I didn't want to be stuck in one place for the rest of my life.

So I started looking for other options -ones where I could travel and work at the the same time. By some stroke of luck I overheard a conversation at work about a book called *The 4 Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss* and it immediately hooked my attention.

*""Work 4 hours a week while traveling the world? Are you kidding me? Now thats sounds like the dream!""*

I immediately went out and bought a copy, devouring it in 2 days. It completely changed the way I looked at work, and shattered my paradigm about the way most people live life. I knew that this was the kind of lifestyle I have been yearning for all along.

I started voraciously researching how to make money online and eventually stumbled upon a super cool, hip subculture of people called *Digital Nomads*. Their ideas and values resonated with me so much that I became hellbent on becoming one. My north star was to become location independent, and work whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted - all I needed was my laptop.

In my research I found Amazon Publishing, which seemed like the most a straightforward online business model:

1. Find hot non-fiction niche on *Amazon*.
2. Hire professional writers to create content on said niche.
3. Purchase the content from them, and self-publish the content on *Amazon*.

To top it off it seemed very *passive*, with the books continuing to make money for years without much further work once up on the platform. I bought a $67 course,  did it within one week and took massive action with my girlfriend. We started seeing results right out of the gate and within the first 3 months I quit my job, as soon as I saw my online income had overtaken my traditional job.

My girlfriend soon followed suit  - we where working at the same company.

Things really started to take off after the 6th month at it, and we got into a niche that was absolutely on fire. We couldn't believe our eyes when we had our first $50K month. Coming from a low to middle class background we had never seen this kind of money in our lives. This was more than our parents made in one year combined.

I felt like I was *unstoppable, on top of the world* and the money could never run out. We booked a one way flight to Thailand to begin our *Digital Nomad* adventure. I soon proposed to my girlfriend on little seclude beach island in the  South Thailand, she said *yes!* Life was nothing short of perfect.

I bought my parents flights from South Africa to come celebrate our engagement in Thailand. This is when things went south. Long story short, my dad drowned in a freak accident while snorkelling in Koh Tao, Thailand. It was an absolute  nightmare trying to get my dad's body back to Cape Town, and my distraught and delusional Mom onto a plane without him.

This is when the the idea of *""life is and fragile"",* and *""live in the now""* belief was solidified in my mind.

It made me question the point of saving money, *if I could die tomorrow*. This false belief was very bad news for my spending habits. I began to spend money *emotionally*, trying and cover the pain of loss with a bunch of experiences and material ""stuff"".

We put our wedding off for months, not wanting to have it at such an emotionally sensitive time.

After spending some time at home to help my mother recuperate we soon hopped on the travel bandwagon again. We quickly got sucked into the *""travel lifestyle""*. Spending more than 90% of our income most months became the new norm - despite earning an average of 15k/pm profit.

We bounced all over Asia, living in places like the island of Ko Lanta in *Thailand, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Bali* and visiting places like *Dubai, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia.*..the list goes on. It was all 5-star hotels, lavish AirBnB's, business class flights, high-rise luxury condo's, expensive pool villas and *beachfront apartments.*

We spent thousands of dollars on new iPhones, Apple Watches, the latest and greatest Macbook Pro's, $5000 Sony Cameras and DJI drones - *half of which I hardly ever used.* If there was something we wanted we just went out and bought it. *Because we could afford it right?*

We made all of the other rookie errors such as eating out at overpriced restaurants *3 times a day* , drinking expensive green tea lattes from *Starbucks* and paying way to much on fancy gym contracts when there was a cheaper option for a fraction of the price.

The real gasoline on the fire was social media. This was keeping up with the Joneses **-** but on steroids, fuelled by scrolling through the Instagram feed and comparing ourselves to our new *“travel influencer”* friends.

Hedonic adaptation lead us to always be chasing the next new thing. Each experience needed to be bigger and better than the last.

I started to noticed that my income started to decrease month by month as we focused less on work and got distracted by the *constant travel, new friends and novel exotic experiences.* This was the catalyst to get me me thinking about my exorbitant lifestyle expenses - *maybe, just maybe, the money could run out?*

I lowered my spending considerably, but definitely not to the level I should have . The ""*shiny object syndrome""* took hold, and I started trying a bunch of new online business models - from affiliate marketing to Social Media marketing - in order to make money *as fast as possible* and get back to our original income.

**This was a massive mistake.**

Instead I should have just focused on the tried and tested Amazon business that was still giving us pretty much passive returns in the background. I spent over $30k on running Facebook ads while trying these other new online business ventures - and got *less than half* of the capital back in sales.

Then I hit another very big speed bump. Some bad tax advice got me to assume that I was tax exempt- since I was technically not residing in any country for more than a 3 month period. WRONG. I got hit with *huge* tax bill, which extracted another $40k from my collapsing profits.

Fast forward to March when COVID hit and I decide it was time to throw in the towel and head back home to South Africa, after my 3rd stint in Bali, Indonesia. With the developing situation and my businesses output decreasing at an exponential rate I thought it to be the smartest choice.

I booked our flights home with my income dwindling and my tail between my legs. I had around 20k in the bank and knew I had to re-focus in a place where I could control expenses and not be distracted by constant travel and stimulation.

Then just a month ago I lost my main Amazon Account due to copyright issues with on of our writers. This was a particularly hard blow, since I recently invested  thousands of dollars into it - which I won't see a return on.

Its been quite the rollercoaster of ups and downs, which has now been brought to a grinding halt. I find myself living at home with my Mom at the age of 31 with little income or savings. The situation is depressing to say the least, but I'm trying to keep my head up, and every grateful for finding the FIRE community 2 months back (although I wish I found it earlier).

I 'm also aware that I am most likely being a big baby, and others have gone through far more dramatic experiences this year. First world problems -  I know. I still have a roof over my head and food in the fridge, so who am I to complain - this is just my story and I thought I'd share.I welcome any comments that will bitch slap the perspective back into me. I probably need all the boot I can get.

I'm also well aware that there are plenty of people living the Digital Nomad lifestyle in a perfectly sustainable way - I was just a moron in the way I approached and executed it.I  personally know people that are *thriving* using geoarbitrage so this is not way a bash on digital nomads. Again it's just my story.

Looking in the rear view mirror makes me disappointed, thinking of what could have been. I know I could have had very similar, rich experiences as I did - just not having *haemorrhaged* all of of that money. But I also know that living life in regret is not going to get me to the goals I now have, and I'm keeping positive - looking forward to re-write this storyIn retrospect, I made t*oo much money too quickly* and having no financial literacy screwed me over big time. That self-sabotage,  the inability to process a traumatic experience in a productive way. Lesson learned.

I've now gone full-on frugal, track everything that leaves my wallet and I'm watching my expenses  - the variable I can most control - like a hawk.

What my fiance and I have now come to realise is  that our priorities have shifted over the past 4 years from *""adventure and excitement""* to *""security and contentment"".*

**GOALS & ACTION STEPS TAKEN SO FAR:**

My  fiance and I have determined our new priorities and  what we value most in life , this is our list:

*- Exploring, creating and capturing memories*

*- Time with friends and family*

*- Good hearty food, coffee and wine.*

*- Quiet mornings with our own space*

*- Healthy, Gym, Sauna and the Outdoors (surfing for me)*

*- Learning new skills and creative time*

*- Feeling financially secure and independent*

&#x200B;

1. I've calculated my leanFIRE number to be $780k which is probably not that accurate since I  went back and ignored big expenses  that I know I will never incur again, and calculated from there. I've decide to round this number up up to $1M since my fiancé and I are planning to get married, have at least one child and move to Portugal within the 6-7 year time frame while attempting to achieve this goal. Also, the a goal of $1M sounds a lot better and  I like round numbers. Again, I know this is probably not entirely accurate and based on projections, but my type-A personality works better if I have a clearly defined goal to work toward.
2. On the expense side of the pie I've identified the seeming force multipliers (the 80/20's) to achieving FI with regards to expenses, which seem to be housing and car payments - please correct me if I'm wrong here, or if I'm missing something. Rent while living with my mom is minimal ($260 a month), which covers her utilities and then a bit extra for her. Super grateful for this as I know I am extremely fortunate to have a loving parent. Bless her soul.My car is paid off and I hardly drive now it now anyway - so these two main expenses seem to be optimised.Will be looking at house hacking when I achieve the income that allows it. Please let me know what other rogue expenses  that could pop up in the future, and I should be on the look out for.
3. I have created a super tight budget of $800 for personal expenses, which was achieved last month. I now meal prep and make freezer meals for the month, eliminating eating out completely. Entertainment activities are only one day a week, and must be free or very cheap.
4. I've sold everything I don't use for extra cash. (Apple watches, cameras, drones etc)
5. On the income side I'm allocating 80% of my time to re-building my Amazon Publishing business. The other 20% of my time I'll be looking for side hustles to diversify my income and not relying on one income source. What are your favourite proven side hustles? Any input will be appreciated.
6. I'm devouring all of the FI content I can get my hands on, namely:MMM blog; *ChooseFI* book+Podcast; *Financial Freedom* by Grant Sabatier book+podcast; Quit like a Millionaire by Kristy Shen; *Work Optional* by Tanja Jester; *I Will Teach You To Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi; *Your Money or Your Life* by Vicki Robins; *The Simple Path to Wealth* by JL Collins; Mad Fientist blog+ podcast; Our Rich Journey Youtube channel and the Financial Mentor podcast. If there are any other recommendations it will be greatly appreciated.
7. As soon as my income covers my business and personal expenses I'll be investing in broad based, low-cost index funds. Any other suggestions for starting out? Recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

Any comments on blindspots you can see I have, the actions you think I should be taking, and where I should be focusing my time will be most welcomed and appreciated!I'm wanting to implement all of the the building blocks of FI to make this life possible.

Thanks for reading and hope you have a groovy day :)

153,"1MM -- 8 years on r/FI -- Career, Mistakes, Leanings, & Path Forward",,14,kdu1x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kdu1x4/1mm_8_years_on_rfi_career_mistakes_leanings_path/,1608064988.0,"8 years ago I stumbled across FIRE and was hooked immediately. I’ve been drawing knowledge and inspiration from [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) ever since -- last Friday, I surpassed the coveted 1MM of invested assets milestone.

Early on I promised to give back to the community upon reaching this threshold, and so I’m sharing my story, mistakes, and key learnings here in the hopes it will be of some value to you all.

**Career:**

Parlayed a love of math and budding interest in business into a career in consulting. While it’s not for everyone, consulting was pivotal in that it (a) gave me a strong foundation in problem solving, business, and communication, and (b) dually kept expenses down + income high. I’ve recently moved over into a data science role in pursuit of better work life balance and a desire to grow in a more technical direction. Happy to answer questions on these careers below as I don’t see them too much in [r/FI](https://www.reddit.com/r/FI/).

**The Numbers:**

&#x200B;

|Year|Salary|Net Worth|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|N/A|$30k|
|1|$100k|$90k|
|2|$105k|$180k|
|3|$135k|$275k|
|4|$145k|$385k|
|5|$210k|$520k|
|6|$300k|$750k|
|7|$330k|$1,000k (now!)|

&#x200B;

* Holdings: 100% S&P or substantially similar. CAGR has been \~10%.
* Expenses: I keep expenses between $25-35K yearly, achieved through budgeting and aided by the perks of consulting. Typically rent has been half of this in HCOL areas (lived with roommates and now long-term girlfriend), with the other half on food / entertainment / travel.

**Mistakes:**

* **Speculative Trading** \-- College: Estimated Current Value: $15K -- In college I got excited about investing and wanted to hit it big quick. I got into speculative oil companies (for the morbidly curious, ticker: HDYNQ). For that I paid the price of a couple summer’s worth of earnings, today worth considerably more. Thankfully [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) didn’t exist at the time.
* **Sitting on the Sidelines** \-- First 2 Years: Estimated Current Value: $40K -- I had learned my lessons on speculative trading, but certainly not on market timing. I was convinced the broader market was overvalued in my first couple of years investing -- but during those 2 years the market went up 20%! Eventually it was time to bite the bullet and get back in, tail between legs.

**Learnings:**

* **Illusion of control** \-- In many ways I consider myself lucky for having made those mistakes on the younger side of my career. I was already overconfident enough to believe I could beat or time the market; had I actually done so it would have only reaffirmed that belief, likely to the tune of much tougher-to-swallow later mistakes. Keeping an open mind and avoiding the fall for the [illusion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control) is a key tenet of how I invest now.
* **Keeping it simple --** The principles of FIRE are remarkably straightforward. I’m disciplined about first putting money in tax advantaged accounts, automatically investing what’s leftover in brokerage, and keeping a loose yearly budget which I track against monthly. I only invest in the S&P. If I’m talking to someone looking for investing advice I position FIRE as accessible as possible -- even a 20% savings rate gets you to FI before 60. For those with further interest, there's additional juice to squeeze from tax loss harvesting, backdoor Roth, and portfolio strategy.
* **FIRE is a tool, not an answer --** For me, FIRE was originally about having a plan and not having to work. About getting handed keys to my life. Along the way I’ve recognized that it’s just as important to “invest” in relationships, health, interests, and community. I try to pass this on to out of college hires by encouraging them to find fulfillment outside of work first; the sooner you can find balance on those dimensions the better.

**What’s next?**

By most measures I’m “financially independent” with a current spend in line with a 3% withdrawal rate. I enjoy what I learn and how I contribute through my job. I’d like kids. For now, I’ll raise my budget by half of whatever is over the 3% SWR and put the other half to work for anticipated future expenses.

As the financial picture looks more and more comfortable, I’ll consider moving part-time, or potentially move to another path entirely where I have interest (education technology, starting a business, teaching). I could also spend more time with family or some lifelong interests (always wanted to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail).",financialindependence
154,Taking a mini-retirement changed my FIRE plans permanently,,1803,kcik2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kcik2p/taking_a_miniretirement_changed_my_fire_plans/,1607892831.0,"2 years ago, I was in a demanding well paid job (Sales Engineering) where despite the perks, pay and status I found myself often day dreaming about retiring to a tropical island and checking on my FIRE spread sheets to see how close I am. After a lot of soul searching, I decided to quit. Went on a mini retirement for a few months and switch to a much easier job I knew I could coast in at a 40% paycut. This is a follow up to [the original post I made at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96jo5r/your_fire_obsession_may_be_a_symptom_of_stress/).

&#x200B;

That was hands down the best decision I have made for my quality of life. My outlook of life and future has changed rather dramatically since then but here is a brief list of things I did and lessons I learned:

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Mini-retirement and switch to lower stress role completely changed my outlook of work. I went from wanting to FIRE ASAP to wanting to go back to work and stay there. The change has persisted for 2 years now. I now no longer see myself ever fully retiring. I should be FI in about 6 years but I don't see it changing much in my life.

&#x200B;

**Events**:

* Setting up 3 month mini retirement: After I quit my job and landed the new role, I realized I hadn't had more than a week off in my entire adult life. I decided it was foolish to plan the rest of my life to work for retirement but never even sample it. And man am I glad I did. I negotiated a delayed start date with my new manager. He had worked with me before and wanted me badly on the team so he agreed.
* First month off: During the first month off I did exactly the type of thing you'd expect someone released from the bondage of work to do. I flew across the country. Drove down the west cost all the way from Canada to San Diego and back, camped in national parks all the way through. Visited family and friends all over the country.
* Emulated retired living for 2 months: The next two months I intentionally tried not to treat my time off as a big vacation and use this time to learn how life would be after retirement. At first many of my days became really unproductive and overshadowed by a feeling of uselessness and slow decay. I usually have no trouble with motivation but I found myself struggling to do much more than play games all day in my PJs. This is when I learned that I have very different mindsets for when I want to get shit done and relax. In order to put myself in the right mindset I started to structure my days a little more. Wake up at a certain time and get a morning routine: shower, coffee, walk. Work on a few personal projects for a few hours to feel a sense of accomplishment. One thing that I started to miss a lot was the social contact at work. Seeing my friends frequently quickly became a very important part of my life during this time.
* New role (QA Engineer): My new role turned out to be exactly as relaxing as I had remembered. There is this implied social narrative that all jobs are equally challenging especially if they pay similarly. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one will openly admit they have an easy job. On top of the fact that very few people have had more than 1 serious career and thus have no accurate way of comparing to other positions. This is my third (did software development as well) and I can confirm that the level of overall stress and cost/benefit ratio between roles even in the same company can be drastically different.

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned**:

* FIRE (specifically RE) fantasies were nothing more than sophisticated tools of escapism. Once I eliminated the main sources of stress from my job, I automatically stopped living in the future. It is an unhealthy way of not living in the present and living life to the fullest.
* Work provides a lot more than money for most people. Much more than people give it credit for and most of it unappreciated. It's also a major source of structure, socialization, challenges, recognition, sense of accomplishment, identity and sense of purpose. In it's absence, you have to recreate a lot of these things on your own except often not as successfully and without the money or motivation.
* Socialization outside of work is really difficult. If you already have a well established social circle and do not plan to move, you might be fine. But if you are planning on meeting people, it will become exceedingly difficult to form strong bonds. Strong bonds often require suffering shared negative experiences together. School and work have a natural way of doing just that. Recreating that when the baser needs are satisfied is much harder than it seems.
* Never settling for a stressful position. The only regret I have is me trying to hang on to positions that were actively hurting my health and not appreciating the amazing life experiences that were passing me by. The money I traded those experiences and my limited time on earth for, has already lost much of its significance.

In April I started working on a net worth tracker for myself. Somewhere along the way it morphed into a sheet for friends, family, and anyone looking to get a hold of their finances. The goal of the sheet is provide you certainty about your financial situation in a time of uncertainty.

Advantages of the sheet over other net worth trackers:

* 100% Free
* No APIs that constantly break. Other trackers that have APIs have to constantly update them and experience periods where the connection is broken.
* Your data is yours. We have no access to your data when you make a copy.
* The sheet is setup to last for many years with minimal to no updates
* Full user guide to make the sheet easy to learn and use

Highlights of the sheet:

* Motivating goal tracking
* Customizable dashboard
* High level of detail if you want it, high level overviews if you don't
* Ability to track self employed users
* Ability to track individuals and couples
* Wedding expense tracker if you need it

In addition to the sheet, I created a full user guide to allow you to jump in and start taking control of your finances.

Edit: added the word ""and"" between the sheet and user guide

Edit 2: Updated the link to Version 1.1. On the Instructions tab I included all changes made due to the help of this community. 

For users with the old version, updating to the new version is as simple as copying and pasting beige cells from the 1.0 version to the 1.1 version. You can copy groups of cells at one time. Just be careful not to copy white cells with the beige.  If you copy and paste columns G and H on the Bank Activity tab, the dropdowns will not appear but the sheet will still calculate correctly.

RECAP

[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ey9jcl/art_to_tech_fire_in_12_years/)

My partner and I are in our mid-30's with 1 kid. We hit our FIRE number but decided to keep working (thank god). I am a creative in tech and partner is in entertainment.

[Here's our updated savings chart](http://imgur.com/a/U8PHeQc)

___________

When the pandemic started, we lost $300k in a few weeks. We felt surprisingly OK about losing 25% of our life savings. Figuring out childcare, not seeing our loved ones, and the uncertain future was way more stressful.

After a month of juggling WFH and childcare, we moved in with my parents. We got a few hours of help a day but I still didn't have time to do much besides chores and work. Luckily, my work allows part time and my request was recently approved! My salary was cut in half to $123k pre-tax/year but I still get benefits like health insurance and 401k. 

My partner on the other hand is putting in a ton of overtime. They are planning to quit next year, maybe do the same thing working for themselves. They said they wanted a few weeks off for videogames first lol.

I've continued to work steadily on art projects including gifts for close friends and family. It feels extra special to give them something custom they will treasure and remember. I also earned a few thousand $ but splurged on a camera, art supplies, and remote art classes. Breaking even on a hobby isn't bad!

Most of my friends from art school have moved on and only a few are professionally successful. I'm proud of them, they worked their asses off to get their dream career. I couldn't do the same. For me, doing art for fun is more fulfilling than doing it as a job.

Like many other people, we spent way less this year. We hit a savings rate of over 85%! Child care ($2.5k → 0 per month) and rent ($2.6k → $1.1k per month) were the biggest savers. Kid expenses were very low, around $60/month since we mostly get used and free stuff from Facebook.

We were able to donate more including to a friend who lost her job. We shoveled extra $ into index funds and dropped bank savings to 2 months of expenses.

Staying with parents is a mixed bag. I appreciate their help and enjoy the family time. They do treat us like teens sometimes and struggle with boundaries, especially with parenting. Once the pandemic lifts we will move out but still visit often and everyone will be happier.

I'm trying to help parents with finances. Mom moved her entire 401k into the money market when it tanked and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars following a friend's stock tips. Dad does daily trades on his 401k and brokerage account. They do save a lot but their investments are Wall Street Bets level of nuts. So frustrating, but not my money, not my retirement.

What's next? I want to keep my part-time job if they allow remote work. I have amazing insurance and the extra money helps reduce sequence of returns risk. We hope to travel often when it's safe to do so. It's my goal to donate even more, aiming to get my company's matching first and then open a donor advised fund.

___________

SUMMARY

 Total $1.67 million in assets: $8k in bank, $250k in company stocks, the rest in index stocks split 80% US + 20% international. The individual stocks are from a liquidity event at a startup and vested RSUs. We're holding for LTCG tax rates. 

 This year we earned $323k pretax and maxed out 401k's, HSA, backdoor roth IRAs, and a mega backdoor roth 401k. I earned about $213k of this.

 Our expenses were $30k, the lowest it's been since college years. It's good to know we can fall back to this level of spending as a safety measure.

 Next year we'll earn ~$153k pre-tax due to me working part-time and my husband quitting. After maxing out tax advantaged accounts, we'll pay under $12k in federal taxes. Compared to ~$70k+ this year, it's crazy low.

___________

This year I learned it's ok to lighten up, be flexible, and change goals. No one could have anticipated 2020 and we tried to make the best of it. We're privileged to be in our position. I'm trying to be grateful, give back, and spend time with loved ones and doing things I love including lots of art!


TLDR; Working less has panned out for our family. After a decade of pushing hard on the gas pedal, we're easing our way to retirement and the easy life.",financialindependence

164,"Traditional vs Roth Contributions, Why it's not Marginal Tax Rates",,147,kbgs6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kbgs6i/traditional_vs_roth_contributions_why_its_not/,1607739703.0,"I was going back and forth with a fellow FI member.  They made the claim that you shouldn't compare effective tax rates in retirement with marginal tax rates during accumulation but you should consider where to put the excess funds once you had enough Traditional IRA assets such that they filled the 12% tax bracket throughout retirement.  Any additional money withdrawn from the IRA would be taxed at the higher tax rate, 22% ,which would be the same during accumulation, if your marginal rate was 22%.  This is something that I struggle with and I decided to run a few scenarios, listed below, to see how this actually pans out.  I made this post so that the community can peer review my assumptions and work and see if it make sense.

*Assumptions:*

Traditional contributions and withdraws operate on a FILO principle such that contributions during accumulation are the first dollars removed from taxable income, and withdraws in retirement are the last added to your income.  Married filing jointly, take standard deduction, earn 150k/yr during accumulation and want to live a 150k/yr lifestyle in retirement.  100% Social Security taxable, in reality, most likely 85%.

*During Accumulation*

20K Traditional Contribution saves 22% in taxes = 4,400 in taxes.  Taxable income 150K - 20K - 25K = 105K.  Fed Taxes: 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 25K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 5.5K = 14.7K / 150K = 9.8% effective tax rate.

**Scenario 1: Pension and Social Security Fill 12% Tax Bracket**

SS = 30K, Pension = 50K, Trad Withdraw 150K - 50K - 30K = 70K.  Effective tax rate on the Traditional IRA money: 70K - 25K (Standard Deduction) = 45K, 45K X 22% = 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 70K Trad Withdraw = *14.1% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 2: No Pension, SS = 30K**

Trad Withdraw = 150K - 30K = 120K.  Effective tax rate on the Trad: 120K - 25K (SD) = 95K, 50K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 6K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 120K Trad Withdraw = *13.3% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 3:  No Pension or SS**

Trad Withdraw 150K, Effective tax rate on the Trad: 150K - 25K (SD) = 125K, 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 150K Trad Withdraw = *12.7% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit).

**Conclusion:**

It seems that the phrase, ""if your income is the same in retirement as it is today then it doesn't matter or Roth is better"" seems incorrect.  Even with the same 150K income/150K retirement lifestyle, the effective rate of your Traditional IRA withdraws is less than the rate at which deposits entered pre-tax vehicles.  I was surprised to see Scenario 1 was actually pretty favorable towards pre-tax.  Mainly because the standard deduction applies to the first (top) dollars of income, so basically Traditional IRA withdraws = the Standard Deduction are Tax Free.  This means that you need to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement in order for the effective tax rate on Traditional IRA money to equal your current marginal tax rate.  How much higher?  That's probably another post.  I tried to make sure I didn't make any math errors.  Let me know if it looks logical and sound.  Thanks for taking the time to read and good luck on your journey!

Edit:  Someone mentioned what about Roth and I believe you could just reverse the thinking.  Instead of saving 22% during accumulation and paying 14.1, 13.3, or 12.7% in retirement, flip it.  You spent 22% during accumulation and saved 14.1, 13.3 or 12.7% in retirement.",financialindependence

166,going uninsured as an option,,128,kbdi75,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kbdi75/going_uninsured_as_an_option/,1607727820.0,"Sorry in advance for the length.

A friend and I are both looking to pull the trigger sometime in the next year.  I spent some time earlier today talking friend and discovered they is planning to self-insure (go without insurance, year by year), and at first I argued against it but ... I'm starting to wonder and would like some opinions.

For friend and family, they expected outlay based on their last two years of great insurance and a moderate ($4000) deductible looked like this: 

	insurance paid: $6000
	they directly paid out of pocket (paycheck and deductible): $8000
	employer paid (employer-side costs): $40000

so for $48000 they received $8000 in benefits.  Equivalent insurance is looking to be roughly the same (unsurprising) plus or minus plans with serious downsides on the lower end (plans with 10%-20% co-insurance).  

Health insurance basically buys you two things - one is it removes your direct involvement in price negotiation (vs. being a cash payer) and second it mitigates very large downside risk.

As an example, the all-cash, negotiation-challenged bill one would expect after the full course of treatment for a heart attack or hemmoraghic stroke could be as much as $350,000 to $400,000 but averages significantly lower (we live in a state that has banned balance billing).  Cancer treatment for a metastatic brain tumor is roughly in that ball park (again, typically much lower -- 70k, $100k) and so on. One of the worst things that could happen that isn't a very low probability is something like finding out you have an AVM, where it is both urgent and the expert surgeons and stereotactic surgery could run over $1M.  

From a probability standpoint, for a man in his fifties, the real risks for his next ten years look like this:

	1.a. injured by some driver in a car accident - carry uninsured/underinsured on your policy to cover it (this is cheap: $50 a month or less for most people)
	1.b. at fault in an accident that injures you (the car insurance does not cover this)
	2. injury somewhere not at home - sue for medical expenses (this could be expensive and you likely will not recover the whole sum but it does mitigate the issue)
	3. Injured at home - oops, this is bad (no idea how to mitigate this)
	4. Heart attack
	5. Cancer
	6. Stroke
	7. Diagnosis with a severe chronic disease like Parkinsons (unlikely) or MS (somewhat more likely)

The actual frequency of #4+ and beyond is low enough that in a given 10Y timeframe, you would really not expect even one event.  Let's be very conservative - assume a 50:50 chance that the worst case scenario happens.  That's a probability of 0.5.

During that time you would pay out around $48000 (declining after a few years when the kids roll off the plan, but offset by the fact that insurance costs have been rising well above inflation) a year, or somewhere around $480k over the course of 10Y (with a probability of 1.0).

	no insurance case: 0.5 * 400,000	= expected outlay of $200,000
	insurance case: 1.0 * 480,000 		= expected outlay of $480,000

For starters, this person is in the position that a sincle outlay of $200k-$400k would _hurt_ but wouldn't be the end of the world or the end of their retirement.

There are also some mitigating factors for the no insurance case, the biggest one being that you're actually only footing part of the costs because the event occurs either during open enrollment (in which case, you buy insurance) where, while you still end up on the hook for the pre-enrollment period, you eliminate the fat tail costs.  Pretty much all of the calendar year, the distance from some day of the year to open enrollment is steadily decreasing and only the spring and summer are actual hazards of not seeing some amount of the event's tail costs covered.

There are all sorts of obvious issues with this:

1. if ACA goes away, the pre-existing conditions problems pre-ACA would be back in force, and the lack of existing coverage to mitigate that would be a serious downside risk vs. just carrying coverage

2. there is actually no mitigation of downside risks at all - especially if both he and his spouse roll natural 1's and get hit with a serious event in close succession; similarly, because they are uncorrelated, it's possible that one has, say, a hemmorhagic stroke followed by the discovery of cancer, and the odds of this increase over time due to age; a really bad sequence of events could wipe this person out

3. obviously, this doesn't work if the single event downside risk is outside your financial buffer

4. items (1.b) and (3) are not mitigated at all, and while both are hypothetically in your control, injuries at home are frequent and at-fault may come down to the details of an accident.

That said, I'd like to hear other arguments pro or anti.

Would you do anything differently?",,128,kao8k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kao8k2/for_people_who_permanently_moved_to_a_different/,1607634427.0,"For background, I'm currently 22 and going to graduate next year with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I currently live in the US, but I am a dual Canadian-US citizen and am planning to move back to Canada at some point in the future. The only thing that I really care about is being FI as soon as possible and I'm not planning to retire immediately because I do like engineering. I want to make sure I make the move at the right time, since I know salaries are much lower in Canada compared to the US. 

I want to move back since all of my family still lives in Canada, and I want to be closer to them as I get older. I would consider moving sooner, but from what I understand, it's very difficult to get an entry-level job in mechanical engineering (that isn't O&G) for outsiders, so I want to make the move when I'm slightly more established. 

So long story short, what I'm wondering is this: When is the best time to make the move? Should I wait until I have reached my FI goals in the US and then go? Is there a tool that I can use to calculate different scenarios including the US and Canada?

And lastly, for those of you who have done this, do you have any advice or even stories about what you did? I'd love to hear about it",financialindependence
172,Roth conversion at what tax rate? Roth conversion vs. taxed SS & increased Medicare costs?,,236,kajvhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kajvhg/roth_conversion_at_what_tax_rate_roth_conversion/,1607621969.0,"I'm 40yo and getting within a couple of years of coast FIRE.  As such, I'm beefing up my retirement plan to simulate Roth conversions of 401k/IRA.  I initially setup my model to convert to Roth whenever I had room in the 12% tax bracket.  However, this will not wind down my pre-tax retirement accounts before SS and Medicare and I will have to plan RMDs.  I will have a pension starting at 60 and I expect to have some inheritance income at some point as well, which complicates the planning a bit.  

So in summary, how do you plan Roth conversions?  Do you limit them based on your highest marginal tax bracket or do you try to get it completed before taking SS and Medicare to minimize tax/cost for these?  Lastly, is there a good tool to help model these complexities?  Thanks!",financialindependence
173,How do you determine your vacation/travel fund?,,55,kanlni,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kanlni/how_do_you_determine_your_vacationtravel_fund/,1607632600.0,"I'm trying to decide how to arrive to a $ figure for a travel fund each year. My wife (26)and I (28) are pretty good at saving: max out both 401ks, roth IRAs, and also HSA and we have a good amount saved up in cash (~6 months living expenses). Both of us have secure jobs so the amount of cash savings is realistically a bit overkill. 

We don't keep a ""strict"" budget but do keep an eye on spending and I have budgeted strictly in the past so I still have a really good idea of where our money is going. I now just mainly keep an eye on cash flow and make sure our checking account isn't dropping each month. We are overall mostly frugal and both agree that we want to (cautiously) enjoy some of our money now because the future isn't guaranteed and we ideally want to take 1-2 moderately nice vacations per year. 

We are in the process of trying to plan a trip right now and I'm struggling to come up with how much we can comfortably afford while allowing us to still take trips each year.  

Does anyone have a good method they use for calculating this number? X% of gross or net income? Something else? What has worked for you?

My fear is that we will book this trip and I will be a cheapwad once we get there because I will feel like we've already spent a lot on travel costs alone so I'll skimp on activities and nicer restaurants - aka the fun parts...  Or my other fear is that we will take this trip then not take another for 3 years. I'm hoping I can avoid these scenarios if I can think of a good way to calculate the slush fund before we go.

174,FIRE Financial progress – Year 1 Review,,154,kabup8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kabup8/fire_financial_progress_year_1_review/,1607589454.0,"Half-throwaway, will post next year again with this user. 

**General:** 

We (F30, M35), living in EU/Germany. Combined Yearly Income: around 95k€ pre-tax. Aiming for (part) FIRE in a super LCOL in EU which we have a house in. 300k€+ is the magic number we aim for. We don’t mind some working in FIRE, since doing nothing is (not yet) our thing. I am planning to change my working time and start a business within the next year, more on this in the “outlook 2021” below. 

Our SR over 2020 is around 40%. We don’t mind it fluctuating, but we have a minimal saving amount which automatically goes to investments at the beginning of every month.

**2020 Thoughts:** 

*2020 has been wild*, due to COVID I got to work at home a LOT and I love home office, but at reduced pay as a cost. Nevertheless, no daily car commute of 45 mins (x2) has buffered this at least partly and given me much more free time. Currently I am employed on full time/pay again. My SO has gone from jobless to work in her dream Job within a bumpy 6 Months, and since she got that full time Job, life is a lot easier for us. Overall, it was a great year financially. Due to COVID our spending on travel has really slashed and this helped getting those saving habits on track. 

**Outlook for 2021**: 

*Job* - I can’t take my current IT-Job anymore and I am increasingly frustrated because of this, no pay can make up for this. In the last 2 Years I drifted completely inside the IT field, from tech and engineering before, and I hate it. My employer is really great overall and very secure / reliable which is the main reason why I am still there, but outside of the IT department there is no Job for me in the company (again, due to COVID), so I am definitely at a dead end. The thing is, my pay is the main income for us and together with the security and reliability of my current job and COVID situation it’s really hard to find something new which checks all boxes. This is the reason why I am so inert on leaving it. 

*My next steps*, after a lot of thinking and calculating, I decided to switch to part time working for 2 years, starting 01.04.2021 next year. This means I will work only 60% of my current hours which equals to 3 days a week. Thanks to German work laws, my employer must allow me this change. But that is not all, I also decided to start my own small business in a huge hobby of mine, and use above mentioned 2 “part time” years to test if this is feasible and working. Cant really wait to get this started and I am really excited for this, so wish me luck! I calculated this through, and it shouldn’t have a major impact on our savings if I cut some unnecessary spending, we will see how it develops. 

My SO is very happy with her job so that is at least great, and she has much room to grow professionally which should also help us in the years to come.

**Portfolio 2020 breakdown:** 

*Net Worth, (no debt): 70k€* 

* ETF´s & Stocks: 24€ (Performance YoY: +15%) 

* Metals: 11k€ 

* Crypto: 11k€ 

* Cash/EF/Travel money: 8k€ 

* Lending: 16k€ 

*Portfolio 2020 thoughts*: Idea was to go ETF´s - USA focused, supplemented with Tech stocks. The whole year I bought ETF´s as base (MSCI World, S&P500) + some major Tech stocks. All in all, I was very satisfied with the outcome with a +15% gain. 

Metals: Investment from 2017/18, actually a good ""return"" since then, but it is seen as a stabilizing factor. And its nice to have the physical coins.

Crypto: the odd one, this are some old holdings from the 2017 bull run, which are “now” quite nice in value again, for doing nothing in this regard, it is very pleasant. 

**Portfolio 2021 goal & orientation:** 

*PF Goal: reach a PF net worth of 85k€+* 

*PF allocation target*: ETF´s/Stocks: 60-70%, Metals: 10%, Cash: 5-10% (max. 10k€), Crypto: ?let it run? 

Portfolio allocation plan 

*ETF & Stocks* 

* ETF MSCI World: 1/3rd of Monthly savings plans always goes into this, my PF core investment. 

* ETF Renewable Energy: 1/3rd of Monthly savings. This I expect to be the next big runner in the years to come. 
Stocks

* Furthermore, I will add to my individual AMD and Nvidia positions at least for 2021, any money I have spare 

*Metals* 

* no change and no investment planed. 

*Crypto* 

* fun money & speculation on another BTC bubble coming, I hold only BTC & ETH. I had my fair share of Shitcoins in the past and got out with “just” a blue eye. Small money is put in here again every month, hope for more future gains across 2021/22. 

*Cash/EF* 

* No Change, we are good here also. 

*Lending* 

* the payback of the 16k€ is planned for this year, so this will be invested when it arrives. Don’t know how it will be split among my positions yet, but definitely split between Stocks and ETF´s.


**Our Milestones Milestones reached in 2020**

* PF Value and CoastFIRE goal reached (Retirement in 25y+): PF value of 50k€ 

*Next Milestones* 

* ETF&Stock Positions value of 50k€+ 
* PF value of 100K€ 

*Finally, Time till FIRE (at current SR): 8 years* 

Thanks for reading and until next year where I hope I can report many more positive developments.",financialindependence

176,How my wife saved me (financially as well as other tings),,1711,k9h5l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9h5l3/how_my_wife_saved_me_financially_as_well_as_other/,1607474699.0,"First let me say I am making this post in response to the amazing and overwhelming comments I received as a result of my comment on another post. You guys are all amazing. I waited until my wife was home and she's here with my as I type making sure I don't miss anything and also to fact check when I exaggerate as I have a tendency to do.

TL;DR: I was a middle-class suburban bum who didn't know anything about money and my wife came from nothing and her work ethic and ability to organize money led me to pay off my student loans last week

Now to get an idea of both myself and my wife I'll give you a little background. I came from a typical Middle Class, suburban American family. My mom is a nurse and my dad has done everything from own a chair factory to delivering dental supplies, but we always were pretty well off. This is also partly due to my father's family being very wealthy and allowing him to inherit the money to buy his home with zero mortgage. Financially, I was taught little or nothing growing up, everyone is aware of the lack of financial prep in the US school system, and my family treated money as a sort of ""dirty"" topic. If you did something for free you were ""clean"" and ""noble"" if you did things outright for the pay it was ""mercenary"" and not considered good. When I was told to look for careers both me and my siblings weren't told ""make sure you can make a living and take care of yourselves"" but ""do what you love, the money doesn't matter"" and the classic ""money doesn't bring happiness"". It took me years to learn that a lack of money can certainly bring UNhappiness.

So, as a result, I found myself making a series of financial mistakes my whole life. Everything from not opening a line of credit (I thought I was ""beating the dirty bankers"") to develop my credit score, to repeatedly overdrawing my checking account to be hit with $500 overage fees AND additional $25 late on paying the overage fees-fees (Once I owed up to $2000 without realizing and only by pleading with both the bank to reduce it to $1000 and my mom to pay it off did I escape that fiasco). And I never really learned. After moving out of the house I did get used to checking my checking account to make sure I had enough money to pay various bills and rent, though I do remember forgetting a few times and having my water shut off. Long story short I found myself an adult with no career, $80,000+ in student loan debt, and zero idea of how to progress.

Now my wife's story is about as opposite as you can get. She was born in Thailand. Her mother was from an extremely poor farming family who sometimes had one bowl of rice to share for the whole family for the day. Her dad was a little better off with a more middle class family and worked as an electrician of sorts. My wife's mother was his second marriage after he drove the first wife off and it was an arranged marriage that my wife's mother did not was to do. She has an older half sister from her father's first marriage (who is a mess) and her father did NOT want another girl, he wanted a boy. In fact her nickname to this day is ""Bee"" stemming from her being ""Plan B"" or ""If it's a boy, his name is A, if it's a girl she's B"".

That theme sort of continued while she was young. Her sister was given as much as the family could support, being the oldest, and had all the normal things like schools supplies and even had her university studies paid for by their father (she dropped out). My wife on the other hand had to make due with hand me down clothes that her mom would sew deep hems in the skirts to fit her body which she would eventually let out bit by bit as she grew. When she wanted to go to school her father told her she had to find the money herself because the family couldn't afford it.

Thankfully, her mom (basically to keep her occupied while her mom was at work) had signed her up for every athletics program under the sun from a very young age and thanks to both good academic grades and a talent for basketball she not only achieved scholarships to a college prep school but to one of the most prestigious universities in the country. She just told me to make sure that I mention how her mom had her keep a record of her spending and saving on a piece of paper ever since she got a small allowance as a little girl and learn how to cut out ""unnecessary things"" (her favorite mantra that I picked up).

While at University my wife had to struggle in the extreme as not only did her family not help with tuition, but food, housing, books, clothes, or anything else was up to her. She had to find a way to make enough money to live and study while competing both for the schools basketball and, occasionally, the schools Judo team, which any student athlete can tell you is already a full time job.

It was hard, very hard. ""The lowest point of my life"" she says. She made money by doing freelance work as a graphics designer (she majored in Animation and Graphic Design, she always wanted to learn to paint but decided she'd never make money doing that, to this day she's an amazing sketch artist and painter btw). She went for years subsiding on about $40 a month. She couldn't even afford rice to eat and had to buy bulk packs of ramen noodles which she supplemented with discount vegetables to literally not get scurvy. This whole time she watched as her family descended into chaos as her grandfather (on her dad's side) passed away and his children, her aunts and uncles fought like hyenas over an elephants carcass over the inheritance and her sister ended up stealing from her father large sums of money, ran off, got pregnant, abandoned her children and came back to continue a sad decline into drugs and bad life choices.

She graduated eventually and tried to make a living as a graphic artist in Thailand, but her dad had lost his job due to a declining mental state caused by PTSD from several brushes with Thailand's underworld while he was an electrical building inspector. So now, she had to support her father (and as a result her sister) on her own. After two years of trying in Thailand she realized she wouldn't be able to and ended up decided to leave Thailand and become and au pair to support her family. I'd like to add that through my wife I've met a lot of au pairs and their lot is utter garbage and little better than slavery in many situations and while many come from decent backgrounds just trying to make some money while they explore the wider world, most are desperate and trying to find a way to escape the poverty of their homes like my wife.

I met my wife in America. I was working as a fat, more than broke delivery driver and she was a struggling au pair working basically 24/7 (I know it's technically not, but when you live in the home you work it does it really matter if you're on the clock if the baby wakes up crying?) and making $195 a week. She sent back $350 a month to support her family and saved the rest as best she could. I had no idea how much I made or where it went aside from I hadn't had an overcharge fee in a little while.

Eventually after meeting, falling in love, and deciding to get married she eventually quit being an au pair and moved in with my and my family (after I moved back to America I moved in with my parents where I still live today) and the journey of first discovering my financial mess and fixing it began, and oh boy, what I write can only scratch the edge of the weekly ""checkups"" and arguments and lectures and stress that went into this development, it wasn't easy for either of us. She couldn't believe she'd become partners with such a disorganized mess and for me it proved to be VERY hard to learn to curb your spending when you never thought to before.

Luckily, I had ""graduated"" from being a delivery driver to working at Solar City. The first step on a long journey that eventually led to me joining the Ironworkers Union. On my development my wife showed me how to keep a physical record of every single penny I spent and earned. I would keep it up for a week, forget and loose the book then she would buy me another one and we began again. I have a closet full of about a dozen checking account books. Then she had me organize my student loans. I had no idea how much my monthly minimums were and was shocked to find out it was almost $700/mo. She taught me what interest was. These were the first steps.

I struggled, I mean really struggled to get the basic concepts of knowing where my money was at all times. Old me thought that was a waste of brain energy and it was a hard mentality to break. I'd say at least a year went by before I really understood how much I made each week/month and what my monthly expenditures were and by then I'd taken my second step in my career as a laborer working for a commercial solar company. Now I was making enough money to start paying off my loans consistently on my own (my mom had been paying part each month) even with my sloppy book keeping. This was the second biggest motivator in my life to get my sh\*t together, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that, yes I in fact could climb out of my hole myself. This and the other motivation led me to working as much overtime as possible and picking up a second job as a pizza delivery guy Friday-Sunday. I was not working more than I thought was possible (depending on overtime opportunities between 65-85 hours a week).

The main motivation though, was seeing my wife's growth no matter how many hours I worked she always ALWAYS worked more it was inspiring, exhaustin and terrifying at times to see. In my previous comment I said she'd nearly doubled her income a year, and I wasn't joking. After she left being an au pair she had to wait 6 grueling months to get her green card. It nearly drove her insane and she ended up working under the table as a cleaning lady to continue to support her family. She'd clean everything from ritsy homes in Cambdrige and Brookline to the utterly disgusting college kid housing around BC/BU/Harvard areas. She kept a paper record this whole time and is checking it now to see how much she made she made a little over $1000/month.

After she was cleared for work she continued as a cleaning lady but also got a job as a cashier, eventually a waitress at a local Vietnamese restaurant. She stopped being an au pair in January, in June she was making $1000/mo, July $1800, August $2100, September $2700, October $3000. She just read those off (I'm rounding to the nearest $100). A year later she'd left the cleaning job and started working as a waitress at a second restaurant as well as picking up shifts at David's Bridal as a seamstress, eventually maxing out at $4500/mo. In March 2018 she made $5200. This is just from pure willpower and work ethic. After going over the numbers this is where she maxes out for the present but even if it's not doubled (sorry my own exaggeration) since then this, to me, is an outstanding growth.

So watching her fight like that how could I not? I worked my bun off right next to her. She taught me to push like I never pushed before and now that I was putting in that many hours and that much effort I finally not only had the knowledge how to track my money but I had a deep desire to know where every drop of sweat was being saved or spent. I got better at accounting using Mint and my bank's online manager. I followed my 401k growth, I checked how much I was spending on gas, on work clothes, I didn't write it down like she did but I learned to keep track of everything. Nothing motivates someone knowing how much they have like knowing how hard it is to earn.

Eventually I got into the Union after years in construction. With my wife's work ethic driving my I'd garnered a reputation as a motivated and dedicated hand wherever I went. I might not be the best, but you can bet I'd be the first there and the last to leave, very few people out worked me. This reputation eventually got me noticed by a Union member and thanks to years of trying to keep up with my wife I'd grown into a much better person and while it can be very difficult to get into a Union it took one week from my first meeting to being on a jobsite with a Union outfit, riding an elevator up the biggest building I'd ever worked on (50ish stories) and up to a career that could support my own family the rest of my life. All thanks to my wife. After that I'd graduated the whole ""watch your money"" phase she taught me more, and we learned together. I started paying off my loans early in a focused way, starting with the highest interest first. I opened credit cards and used them both sparingly and paid them off each week to keep my balance low and my credit score high. I started investing in basic stocks to get a feel for the market, putting about 10% of my paycheck in as a learning cost and two years after getting into the ironworkers union I FINALLY paid off the last of my student debt. From $80,000+ to $0 all thanks to my wife's guidance and teachings.

Sorry this is an aside but it's actually funny, compared to any American construction worker I was a hungry tiger who devoured work, and it actually meant I ended up being classified less as ""one of the Americans"" but was adopted by the other class of hungry-tiger-worker in my industry: the other immigrants. Construction in any state in the US is done by Spanish immigrants, not completely but they are a constant and huge presence on any jobsite. Most I've met work like my wife. Voraciously. They came from harder lives than most can understand (An Elsalvadorian friend of mine, and the best carpenter I've ever seen, tell me how when he was 12 a guerrila army told him he was to fight with them or they'd kill his mom so he did that until a helicopter gunship killed them all so he ran and got a job loading boulders onto trucks). My motto since then has been ""Work like an immigrant, get paid like a citizen"". That last part is unfortunately since many are illegal they get taken hugely advantage of with no options.

To finish this insanely long tale: After I got in the Union my wife saw how the Union allowed minorities and women a chance to work in the trades and the benefits both in take home pay, and in benefits (Insurance, annuity, pension, vacation pay, free training) and decided she wanted to make the move, too. Ever since she was little she wanted to be like her dad, an electrician, but he told her girls couldn't do it. Now, when the opportunity presented itself she gave it her all, like she always does, and less than a year later she is the top student in her 1st year technician apprentice class and had multiple supers and foremen tell her she'll be a foreman soon, which I never doubted.

179,Math of healthcare subsidy versus maxing out the 0% bracket for tax-gain harvesting?,,184,k9akc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9akc4/math_of_healthcare_subsidy_versus_maxing_out_the/,1607454337.0,"So, I recently pulled the trigger and am at least going to be taking an extended sabbatical, and am currently in the process of signing up for health insurance for 2021.  I'm starting to do some math to figure out whether it's worthwhile to set income at the ~60k level to get some subsidies, or fill up all the way to ~80k in order to tax-gain harvest the last 20k.  

I'm in MA so some ACA things are a little more complex for me, and nobody can give me a straight answer but apparently if my income stays under ~$61k I think I get a health plan that costs $150/mo directly through the state?  I'm 36 and my wife is 47 if it matters.

We expect to spend ~50k/year before health insurance premiums, and the first set of investments that will be sold for rebalancing purposes have a cost basis of ~$0, so 100% of it will be capital gains.  There's multiple years of those $0 basis gains to go through.

I'm curious if anybody else has had similar situations and made a decision one way or the other?  I'm leaning towards filling up the tax bracket and maxing out gain harvesting in lieu of the subsidies, just because I have so many gains.

I realize I'm rounding some numbers here, probably erroneously.  This isn't necessarily a ""specific advice for fryguy8"" post, this is a ""what have other people in maybe similar situations done"" post to hopefully be more broadly educational.",financialindependence

I’m tired of generalizations (especially in places where the demographics skew male, like finance subreddits) about women being obstacles to a man’s FI journey at best, or high-maintenance gold-diggers at worst. So I feel obligated to be a visible example of a FI-minded woman, and to add another female voice to the FI conversation.

* Super fortunate in many ways. Graduated debt-free from a top school
* Investment banking → tech (but non-engineer)
* \>60% savings rate in a VVHCOL city - live comfortably but intentional about spending

* **I was super lucky, in a lot of ways**. I had a middle-class upbringing but my immigrant parents both worked full-time and taught me the value of education and of saving money early on. We always spent below our means.
* **My upbringing and debt-free education = single biggest driver of my financial success thus far.** My parents also paid for my college education so I graduated debt-free from a top university (one of Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford). I amassed a small starting stash of \~$20K by graduation from working paid internships during every college summer (and investing my savings).
* **I started my career in investment banking, then transitioned into corporate strategy at tech companies**. Initially I took a pay cut in leaving finance, but have since grown my income comfortably - and it was worth it solely for the higher quality of life (i.e. not working 80 hours/week in a soul-crushing grind, surrounded by very rich yet deeply unhappy people, adding little discernible value to society).
* **I currently live very comfortably in a VHCOL city**. I eat well, take plenty of vacations, rent a nice apartment, buy myself small luxuries, etc. - but am intentional about spending my money where I feel it most improves my wellbeing.
* **My savings rate is currently >60%**, which includes maxing out retirement contributions. I acknowledge this is also only possible because I’m young and don’t have any dependents yet (my boyfriend is a software engineer and does fine, though I’m proud my income/NW are higher than his) - if I have kids in this city in the near future, my expenses will definitely skyrocket.

***On investing***

* Investing has been a major driver of my net worth growth: **\~$275K of the $750K NW is from investment gains made over the last 5 years.**
* I’ve invested all of my extra money (excluding 6 months emergency savings / small amount in checking) since I was in high school.
* Passive investing is objectively the best approach for the vast majority of people. About ⅔ of my net worth is passively invested in diversified low-fee index funds / ETFs.
* However, I enjoy active investing and doing the research, so **about ⅓ of my NW is invested in individual stocks**. My actively invested portfolio has made substantial returns over the last 5 years thanks to several investments that have doubled, tripled, up to 9x’d - like NVDA, NVCR, SQ, TWLO, CRM, etc. Given that I’m young and have a very long investing horizon, I’m okay with having a somewhat higher level of risk in my portfolio from these individual stocks.
* **I also basically never sell my investments** \- have never tried to time the market, never sold because I thought it was about to crash, etc. It’s worked out pretty well for me, with my 5Y annualized return beating all market indices in the same time period - time will tell if that’ll continue to be true.

***Reflecting / looking ahead***

* My target milestone is to hit **$1M net worth by 30**, which looks quite feasible at my current income and assuming my portfolio/the market doesn’t tank in the next 2 years.
* Getting to the first $100K really is the hardest - it just keeps snowballing from there, and your NW increases faster and faster... I only made a post about hitting $500K \~4 months ago! 
* **I don’t count illiquid equity in any of my projections**. Even though it might turn into a big payday if my current company goes public, for now, I treat it as imaginary money. (If it does become liquid, then my path to FI will accelerate substantially, given I have high six figures in nominal equity value, both vested/unvested.)
* **$2.5M is my fat-FI number**, but I’ll probably keep working after I hit that. But who knows - if I get married / start a family / have kids, maybe my priorities will change.
* Leaving finance for tech was a big leap for me, in part because staying in finance was the path of least resistance / most prestige / highest comp. I could have left my top-tier investment banking job for a role in private equity / hedge funds / venture capital instead, and been making $300K+ comp as a 24-year-old (as many of my banking peers did). Taking a pay cut to go to a startup felt risky and uncomfortable at the time -- but I have no regrets, looking back. Leaving finance made me happier, healthier, and a better and more interesting person; even if it also meant a slightly longer path to hit NW milestones, I’m still doing just fine. The tradeoffs were more than worth it.

181,[UPDATE] $500k the boring way,,1519,k8it0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8it0c/update_500k_the_boring_way/,1607355448.0,"This is an update of my previous post, [“$250k the boring way”](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/) and my original post, [""$100k the boring way""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/). I’ll recap as best I can but all the details are in those if you're interested.

**Summary**

Reached $500k (now $600k, sorry I'm lazy) net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 8 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Quick Recap** **^(that keeps getting longer am I getting old)**

My wife and I are both 32 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I’m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $250k net worth we:

* Both got graduate degrees.
* Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
* Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $116k for me and $54k to $80k for my wife.
* Had a baby and wife took some unpaid time.
* Bought a house

**Updates**

Second half of 2019: Nothing really happened financially but we did take a family vacay to NZ and Fiji for 2 weeks. Somehow made it work taking a 1.5 year old halfway across the world and can't say enough about how much I would recommend both places. Can't say it was always relaxing but I would do it again. Also found out we were going to be having another baby.

In the last update my job had just added on-call pay. I ended up with about $5k of this bringing me to $121k total compensation.

2020: Our son was born in early March right as the pandemic was lifting off. I still haven't decided if this was a great time to have a baby or a horrible time. Financially, our timing was (purposely) a lot better with the school schedule and combined with a new maternity leave policy at my wife's job, she didn't have to take any unpaid leave this time around.

At my job, I got another 5% merit raise plus COLA increase bringing me to my current base salary of $126k. Looks like I'm on track for another $5k of on-call pay on top of that. My company went all remote so I haven't been back to the office since the day my wife went into labor. I'm liking the work from home situation a lot and expect that I will be WFH at least 2 days a week once the office is open again.

We refinanced our house in the spring from a 30yr 4.5% down to a 20yr 3.25% loan which increased our monthly payment but saves us an estimated $120k over the life of the loan, so that's nice. I'm actually working on another refi right now to get down to 20yr 2.875% to save an additional $30k. I imagine I'll call it good here but hey you never know.

This fall when school resumed, we made the decision to drop my wife down to part-time. This has been our plan from the beginning: work 5 years to qualify for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program and then go to just 3 days a week in order to have more time for family but still accrue full years towards the pension.

On that note, we applied for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program in June as soon as my wife's 5th year had ended. Our application was rejected by our servicer Nelnet 3 times before being sent on to the Dept. of Education in September. It was a very slow and frustrating process but ultimately was worth the hard work, as we found out just last week that it was approved and $17.5k was instantly removed from our balance. I got a lot of questions on this program last time - all the details can be found [here](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher). We have just $10k of loans left now that we will let sit there until they start accruing interest again or are forgiven by the new administration.

**Chart**

[Here is our financial journey summed up in one line](https://imgur.com/VDa8UcH). It's definitely starting to look like more of a curve now. The inflection points that used to stand out just kind of look like noise now, so here are the relevant dates in list form:

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
3. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
4. 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
5. 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.
6. 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.
7. 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.
8. 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.

**Current Finances**

* $90k e-fund, $5k in an HSA.
* $326k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* $189k equity in our home
* \-$10k of student loans remaining
* Current savings rate is down to 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies.
* Monthly expenses have gone up quite a bit, looking like our budget is about $7k which seems crazy to me. Luckily daycare isn't forever I guess.

**Thoughts**

Salary

I mentioned in my last update that I was closing in on the salary cap in my current position. At the end of this upcoming January I will get like a 1% raise and be maxed in my band. Unfortunately to go higher means I would likely need to take on a supervisory role, and I'm not sure yet if that's something I want. I've been doing all the required trainings for that just in case but I really like the position I'm in now so no rush I think.

Now What

Student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. For 8 years now they have weighed on me, sometimes heavily (and that's even with knowing that our career choices meant we would be okay and get them paid off eventually). The loan forgiveness was something we carefully planned for. It's definitely a weird feeling to be essentially student debt-free after pouring so much time, money and energy into dealing with them. Luckily I can fill this void with a very long to-do list.

Near term, I need to put a priority on making a will for us and making sure all of the stuff related to that is in order. Along those same lines I'd like to get some extra life insurance going besides just the basic coverage we get from work automatically. Still haven't put a lot of thought into our strategy for saving for college. We are likely buying a minivan (please give me all your minivan tips and recommendations) in the next couple months. Longer term, we have started talking about what a home upgrade might look like for us.

**The End**

My third update (at least to me) seems even more boring than ever. Having a new baby and navigating the pandemic at the same time meant that in the past 9 months I really haven't had much time or energy to think about saving, spending, or retirement so it all just sort of happened on its own. Before preparing to make this update I hadn't logged in to categorize our transactions since June which is crazy for me. I basically stopped coming to this sub vs being a daily reader. I'm most definitely in ""the boring middle"" now.

In the last update I had said ""The financial peace of mind is extremely valuable to us as we navigate the wonderful and scary world of parenting"". Well since then, we doubled down on the parenting and added a global pandemic on top. We are extremely fortunate to still have our jobs and our health, and I don't take that for granted. To not really ""worry"" about money during this time is a luxury to be sure, but one that we worked hard for. 

Thanks for reading, everyone. Back to saving now. See you at the $1M update!",financialindependence

190,The 401k early withdrawal penalty is really not that bad,,1109,k78klb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k78klb/the_401k_early_withdrawal_penalty_is_really_not/,1607179176.0,"I often hear of those not wanting to contribute much to their 401k due it being ""locked away until 59.5."" However in my view, the penalty does not make the 401k an untouchable lockbox. All it is is a fee, not some illegal or super complicated thing.


In fact, if you were to FIRE, you could very well come out ahead by putting money into your 401k and then eating the fee vs investing in taxable brokerages. The combination of tax deferment, compounding growth, and effective tax rates could work in your favor.

**Quick and Dirty Math:**

Alice and Bob both plan to FIRE and each needs $40,000 per year to sustain their lifestyle. Alice has $25,000 gross income per year to invest and contributes it to her taxable brokerage account. Bob will take the same $25,000 gross income and invest it between his pre-tax 401k and traditional IRA. We will assume both Alice and Bob are in the 24% federal tax bracket, making about $100k/yr as single filers, and that they receive a 5% annual return. 

Using the 4% rule, Alice's FIRE target is 25x40,000 = **$1,000,000**. She does not meet the threshold to pay any capital gains taxes on withdrawal.

Bob has to adjust his FIRE target since he knows he will be paying the early withdrawal penalty (10%) plus the effective tax rate on his annual withdrawals. His FIRE target is **$1,225,825**, based on 25x ($40,000 + 10% Penalty + Federal Effective Tax Rate of ~8.4%)

|Year|Alice's Year-End Amount|Bob's Year-End Amount|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$19,000|$25,000|
|2|$38,950|$51,250|
|3|$59,898|$78,812|
|4|$81,892|$107,753|
|5|$104,986|$138,140|
|..|..|..|
|25|$906,814|$1,193,177|
|26|$971,115|**$1,277,836**|
|27|**$1,038,713**|$1,366,728|

**Summary:**
Due to the upfront tax burden at a top marginal rate of 24%, Alice can only contribute $19,000 out of the $25,000 she allocates to invest per year. She reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 27.

Bob reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 26, about a year ahead of Alice, despite having a higher target. He gets there first because:

 - He can shovel significantly more money into his investments each year
 - Compounding is working harder in his favor 
 - His effective tax rate in retirement (~8.4%) is lower than the marginal tax rate (24%) he would have paid while working

**Other Thoughts:**

 - If Bob had received an employer match, he would have gotten there even sooner
 - Bob isn't going to pay the penalty forever. At some point he will reach 59.5, stop paying it, and his nest egg will remain larger than Alice's.
 - Alice is going to have a tax drag during her working years due to dividend income, so realistically she'd perform worse (thanks to lurker_cx for making this point)
 - If Alice and Bob made between between $60k/yr and $80k/yr and were in the 22% tax bracket, Bob would have still gotten there sooner but by a smaller margin
 - If they were each married filing jointly, their marginal tax bracket goes down to 22% and Bob's effective tax rate in retirement falls to ~4-5%. He still gets there sooner.
 - It doesn't matter whether you plummet the rate of return to 0% or ratchet it up to 20%, Bob reaches his goal sooner.

**Conclusion:**
The early withdrawal penalty will not kill you. While this is a simplified scenario and your situation may vary, it's very possible you can eat the penalty and *still come out ahead* of investing outside retirement accounts. Of course there are caveats (don't eat the penalty too early) and **there are better paths than doing what Bob did** - diversifying your tax buckets, Roth conversion ladder, etc - but he committed what is often seen as a financial sin and still comes out just fine.",financialindependence

192,Visual Results of u/melonbalon's financial independence survey!,,212,k7bzlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k7bzlr/visual_results_of_umelonbalons_financial/,1607190550.0,"4 years ago [u/melonbalon](https://www.reddit.com/u/melonbalon/) posted [fantastic survey data](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4tur6p/survey_results_here_you_go/) from nearly 1,400 redditors capturing anonymous information about who they are and where they live, their finances, their FI/RE progress, and so much more. I've compiled some of the results into a [visual](https://imgur.com/a/0FRJUDi) with the hope of providing more insight into what traits tend to be shared amongst both those groups in pursuit of FI/RE as well as those who have achieved it.

A few highlights:

1. Commute times are super low. Nearly 70% of respondents had a commute of less than 30 minutes.
2. Of those who have FI/REd nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but perhaps more interestingly an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. 15% had no degree.
3. There was an even split amongst urban and suburban living environments (\~47% each, remaining 6% rural). This held true independently in both the group pursuing FI/RE as well as those who have FI/REd.

If new survey data were to be made available I would love to create a more updated version of this as I'm sure this last year in particular has altered financial behavior in a number of ways.

Note: While this visual also sits on my website (which I won't be linking out of fear of ban), I will never require a subscription or a paywall to access it given that it wouldn't have been possible without community involvement. Nor will I for any visualizations of future survey results.",financialindependence

194,Unusual FIRE Path--overcorrection,,287,k6ruxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k6ruxb/unusual_fire_pathovercorrection/,1607110649.0,"Thought I'd share in case anyone was in the same boat as me.  Essentially I started out deep in the hole, and have created a path to FIRE as a side effect of digging myself out.

Middle class kid growing up.  Went to college.  As sort of a surprise (due to family stuff), I graduate with 240k debt at a little less 6% not dischargeable in bankruptcy (due to legislative change).  This seems overwhelming on any likely entry-level salary, so I do a professional degree to ensure higher income starting out.

Next, I experience a series of unfortunate events.  My mother takes ill while I'm in school, and I start supporting her and paying her medical expenses out of pocket, which I will do for about 8 years.  This is before you could get insurance for pre-existing conditions so it's rough until Medicare kicks in.  At the same time, wife takes ill, end up doing support and out of pocket off and on for about 4, until she recovers.  At some point, I have to move to an expensive area for work.

So I do about an 80-100 hour week while being generally frugal for 10 years to make ends meet.  I also get very lucky by surviving a couple layoffs with minimal unemployment during the great recession.  Over time, through no fault of my own, my salary grows to about 300-400k/year.  About four years ago, horrible financial things stop happening (more or less), and I take off like a rocket.

Now I'm at a NW of 950k.  500 liquid-ish (not retirement) split 450k invested and 50k in cash.  200k in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (also invested).  250k in house.    700k mortgage at 3%.  One more kid to go.  Two income family, knock on wood.  \~6k/month in total expenses (factoring in deductions).  Could theoretically live on partner's salary, but only just.

Considering doing FIRE once the post-tax money is around 1m and net worth is around 1.7m.  The notion of making less than 2x expenses post tax is terrifying, but I might try a year to focus on health and family at least.

In exchange for some self-validation, I'm also going to provide as much info on my journey thus far as I can. I do things a bit differently than the mainstream consensus here, so hopefully I can spark some interesting discussion.

&nbsp;

When I logged into my Personal Capital account this morning, I was greeted by a second comma in my NW number for the first time! Breakdown is as follows:

* Checking: $9,700 (cash)  
* Self Escrow: $8,200 ($750/mo into SNSXX)  
* Emergency Fund ""Cash"": $8,700 (SNSXX)   
* Brokerage: $54,200 (70% Total US / 30% Total Ex-US)  
* Holding (Brokerage): $375,200 (70% Total US / 30% Total Ex-US)  
* Actively Managed: $96,700 (West End Advisors; Global Equity)  
* MLI's: $67,300  
* Roth IRA: $85,100  
* 401k: $296,300  
**Total: $1,001,400**

I know a lot of that doesn't look like the standard FIRE playbook, so I'll provide some additional backstory.

&nbsp;

**Student Loans**  
My parents paid my tuition for my first 2 years and I took out loans for room, board, and general living expenses. After my sophomore year, I landed a fairly lucrative internship (that I returned to after junior year as well) and paid my own way out of pocket for the final 2 years. I graduated with a Petroleum Engineering degree in May 2012 with $32k of student loans.

&nbsp;

**Early Career**  
I landed a job with one of the supermajors and was offered both a ""normal"" engineer-in-training position and a less desirable ""field focused"" position. I opted for the latter because it was a 14/14 rotation schedule (2 weeks on the rig, then 2 weeks vacation), which gave me more flexibility in my living situation and also paid slightly more once travel benefits and per diem stipends were taken into account. Starting pay was $98k/yr with a $10k signing bonus. Since I spent half of the year living on the rig and most of my off-time traveling, I only ended up leasing a storage room to keep all of my shit in. By the end of 2012, I had paid off my student loans on a gross income of ~$60k over those first 7 months following graduation.

After finishing my first 6 months of training, I got a pay bump to $120k and grossed around $135k in my first full calendar year (2013). Since I wasn't sending all of my money each month towards student loans any more, I opened a Vanguard account after finding this sub (lurked with no account for a long time) and starting depositing all of my leftover cash each month into VTSAX. After a year in the field (so halfway through 2013), I was pulled in for a short-term project that was office-based in another state. Since this was only supposed to be a 6-month ""temporary relocation"", I was provided a furnished corporate apartment and daily food stipend. That 6-month assignment turned into a 1yr assignment and then a month later that same boss found another 1yr project he wanted me for, so I ended up living rent-free in that corporate apartment for 2 years and continued shoveling all of my extra cash each month into my Vanguard account. There was also another pay bump when I started the second assignment and, including imputed income from the apartment, I grossed $186k in the second full calendar year.

The end of that second assignment happened to coincide with my completion of the training program and I was missing my old rotation schedule, so I accepted a job as an ops supervisor in our deepwater fleet and went back to the 14/14 life. I ""returned"" to Houston to avoid state income taxes while working offshore (""merchant mariner"" since I only worked in federal waters) and upgraded my storage room to a utilities-included garage apartment I found for $500/month. This new job was also a promotion, so my gross pay for calendar year #3 ended up being $205k. 

That brings us to the end of 2015. At that point, I had worked 3.5 years, had made it past the $200k comp mark, had only paid rent for 6 months ($3k total lol), and had ~$300k saved between my Vanguard account, 401k, and Roth.

&nbsp;

**Buying a House (Wtf is that ""Holding"" account???)**  
Fast forward a couple of years and I was getting burned out doing the offshore gig. All of my best friends were getting engaged, buying houses, having kids, moving into managerial positions etc. while I spent half of my year on a floating tin can and the other half either sleeping in hostels around the world or bringing Tinder girls back to the sketchy garage I ""lived"" in. I didn't feel like I had a purpose in life even though I was ""living the dream"" and making $200-225k each year. I decided it was time to put my technical education to use and transition to a more traditional office-based job. When I told management that I wanted to make a switch, I got offered a deepwater drilling engineer position that came with a relocation package and decided I would buy a house in the new city.

I had also hired a financial advisor in early 2017 when I hit the $500k NW mark and later that year was when I started house shopping. I know financial advisors get a lot of hate here, but I've been pretty happy with mine. He was a guy that had been working as an assistant for my parents' FA that I had talked to a couple of times already. He's only ~8 years older than me and was always the guy that came up with creative ways to boost wealth generation. He had decided to leave the firm that my parents were using to start his own team and was taking on new clients, so I jumped on board. 

After talking with him extensively about it, I decided to go the route of a Securities Backed Mortgage (SBM) when buying my house. This is why there is a separate ""Holding"" account listed above. I knew this wasn't going to be my Forever Home, so I also combined the SBM with a 10yr I/O ARM. What all of this means is that I was able to buy a $495k house with a 0% down payment, no PMI, and I have only made interest payments during my 3 years of ownership. When I bought in Jan 2018, I had ~$285k in my Vanguard account and had ~$40k cash from the relocation package that I planned to use for the down payment. Instead of selling shares to come up with a traditional down payment and then locking up a bunch of capital in home equity, I used the SBM to get credit for a ""20% down payment"" by giving them a lien on enough shares to be a 30% down payment (~$150k). I still have direction over that account (with a few reasonable rules), but it is tied to the house until I have 20% equity (or sell it). That $150k is the maintenance number that I have to stay above, so I moved the full $285k from Vanguard into that holding account to provide enough buffer to weather a ~50% market downturn before getting hit with a call for peace of mind. The $40k cash is what I used to open the actively managed account as a trial and set up a recurring $1k/month that is essentially what would have been going to mortgage principal with a traditional note.

So instead of a $99k down payment and a $2,400/month note ($1600 interest / $800 principal), I kept that $99k invested in index funds and pay $1,500/month in interest while voluntarily making a $1,000/month ""house payment"" to myself. Without getting too deep in the weeds on the numbers, all of this has netted me an extra ~$45k gain over the last 3 years.

&nbsp;

**MLI's**  
This is the other thing that probably looks out of place and is where I've been putting the extra monthly cash that used to get blindly shoveled into Vanguard. The offerings change month to month, but most of these are tied to either DJIA, S&P500, or European Large Cap indexes with leverage amounts in the 120-180% range with the downside being less liquidity due to 3-5yr maturities. If I have $5k that I know I won't touch for 5yrs, why buy S&P500 ETF's when I can buy a 5yr note from Barclays for S&P500 shares with 150% upside leverage? It's a small portion of my total portfolio, but it's a way to squeeze out a little bit more market performance when you know liquidity isn't an issue. My FA sends me the list of these every month and I just tell him what I want, so I'm not sure if this is something available to normal retail accounts or not.

&nbsp;

**FIRE Numbers**  
I've always carried $10k/month as my FIRE target even though it's probably a bit more than I really need (current monthly spend is only ~$6500) because I would need to be on the ""fat"" side of FIRE to justify leaving my career. Also want to have enough of a buffer that deciding to have a family down the road doesn't completely torpedo my plans. That monthly spend target translates to a NW target of $3,000,000, so I'm nowhere close to my full FIRE mark yet. But getting my second comma definitely makes it feel like I'm at least on track and being close to double my CoastFI number ($550k) could be considered the ""FI"" part of FIRE. I could realistically see myself in position to comfortably FIRE around 40-45, depending on how the whole family thing turns out.",financialindependence

I've been working towards FIRE for the past 10 years and my projections show that I'm about 9.5 years away from retiring.

I'm a VP at a mid sized tech company with a decent income (about $230k) but underpaid compared to market rates. The job is relatively low stress so I'm not too concerned about being underpaid, but it has its moments where shit can really hit the fan and it takes a lot out of me. 

I don't know if this is a mid life crisis, but like many of you, I'm really starting to feel the grind. I haven't taken more than 4 consecutive* weeks off since I graduated university.

With a baby on the way, I have an opportunity to take parental leave and step away for a few months with a guarantee that I'll have my job waiting for me when I return. My wife is a SAHM in case that matters. 

I'll miss out on about $40k in savings due to the income hit and about 4 months of expenses (another $30k). I'd be delaying FIRE by about a year. 

I do realize that I'll have a newborn through all of this, so it won't truly be a break, but I'm going to have a newborn baby either way.

I have ambitions of potentially using some of the time to try to launch my own business, but that really depends on the kiddos. 

I'm not sure exactly what I'm hoping to achieve with this post. I guess I'd just like to hear about others perspective on this and if anyone else has done something similar. Is it worth delaying FIRE?

I thought I would share my story since I enjoy hearing how other people are doing on their path to FIRE. I have laid it out effectively in terms of school years since I still think in those terms. I only discovered FIRE in the last three years so I also don’t know my net worth for most years but have included estimates that are likely close.

**College and background**

I grew up in a low income household and felt very poor. Ended up at a highly selective liberal arts school. Their financial aid was pretty great at first but fell off a bit. I remember paying only $4,000 for my first year. This jumped to about $10,000 per year for the next three years. Not bad for the experience though. I had only saved a few thousand for college and I wasn’t excited about the prospect of debt, so I worked during school. 25-30 hours a week generally. On top of a very difficult course load (40-60 hours a week on coursework) I ended up feeling very tired and stressed. Looking back I regret working so much. I didn’t even make that much money really.

I studied Physics. A friend of mine tried to get me to take Economics, but it never fit my schedule. I tried to take a Computer Science course, but I couldn’t take it due to demand. I regret both of these things.

**Year 1 (June 2012):**

**Salary $52,000 Cash $12,000 Debt $17,000 NW $-5,000**

While I had always wanted to get a Doctorate, I became disillusioned with the post graduate school job market and decided to enter industry instead. I started working at a small manufacturing company as a Physicist/Manufacturing Engineer. It turns out there are not a lot of options to pursue as a physicist. I didn’t know what I was doing but at least there wasn’t too much pressure on me. Moved to a MCOL area.

Paid off my debts in several months thanks to dirt cheap living expenses (<$1000/month). This was thanks to $400/month rent due to sharing a house with four other people in a not great part of town. I didn’t really track my net worth. I just deposited money in my checking account and tried not to spend too much. I think I put around 8% in my 401k. Looking back, I should have maxed it.

**Year 2:**

**Salary $57,000 NW $20,000?**

Not much to report here. Just worked. Started graduate school part time in Mechanical Engineering. I felt a lack of options with only a Physics degree and felt I would have more options with an MSME. Probably a great choice especially since my work paid for it. I also initially enjoyed classes.

**Year 3:**

**Salary $63,000 NW $50,000?**

I bought the house that I was renting. I probably overpaid for it, but I rented out rooms so it more than paid the mortgage. I guess I was house hacking. It really was about doing something with the money that was just accumulating in my savings account. Investing was scary to me. I borrowed $25,000 from my mother to help me cover the deposit and avoid PMI. I agreed to pay her back over the next 2.5 years.

I also got engaged this year. More on this later. I continued taking classes.

**Year 4:**

**Salary $70,000 NW $100,000?**

I got married! My wife was an artist so didn’t bring in very much money but also was debt free. We kept two renters, but they no longer covered the mortgage. Between a decrease in rent, paying for healthcare for my wife (an extra $400/month), and paying back my mother, things felt very tight. I kept contributing to my 401k though. This brought a fair amount of stress to the relationship. **I highly recommend talking about earning expectations before marriage.** We talked about everything else, but somehow this didn’t come up. I think in part because I was doing fine on my own and didn’t connect the loss of rental income plus increased expenses with marriage. What we did that helped was to budget. This was absolutely critical.

**Year 5:**

**Salary $77,000 NW $140,000?**

This was a big year in many ways. Finished graduate school. Woo! Unfortunately part way through graduate school I realized I didn’t want to be an engineer. I enjoyed the business side of work and should have gotten an MBA.

My wife applied to graduate school as we decided she needed to have a more steady career. We paid off the loan to my mother. The payment was the size of a mortgage, so it felt like we finally had some breathing room.

Perhaps most importantly, this was the year that I discovered FIRE. This was good because I really started disliking my job at some point this year.  **Started maxing my 401k.**

**Year 6:**

**Salary $87,000 NW $175,000?**

I got promoted at work and started managing a team of engineers. I again liked my job though it was more stressful. I also applied to MBA programs. Missed out on top tiers schools (screwing up my Wharton interview is a very sad memory) but got an offer for full tuition at a mid-tier. Thanks to the promotion I decided to do part time grad school again since the company would pay for it. This was painful but probably a good choice.

Started ROTH IRAs for myself and my wife. My wife started graduate school. She worked part time as well. Between part-time work and scholarships, most if not all of the cost was covered.

**Year 7:**

**Salary: $95,000 NW $250,000**

Started grad school. Sold my house and moved to a small 1 BR apartment in a nice part of the city we live in. It was nice to get money out of the house and be able to invest it. I didn’t make a ton from the house sale but it lowered stress. Home ownership, especially for an older home, requires a lot of work.

Started tracking balances every 2 weeks. Felt like this was a good balance of knowing what is happening without getting obsessed.

**Year 8:**

**Salary: $123,000 NW $325,000**

I finished grad school part 2. Wife finished graduate school. I negotiated for a much higher salary at work. Started disliking work again though. Unfortunately covid happened so my wife was furloughed and went to doing gig work. She definitely made some money but it isn’t included in salary here. Started to finally not feel poor as well. That may be silly that it took so long but growing poor leaves marks that take a long time to fade. Something about hitting a significant income level and living in a nicer spot made a big difference.

**Year 8.5 (Present)**

**Salary: $130,000 NW $400,000**

I accepted a job offer in a HCOL/VHCOL city. I will be making less when accounting for cost of living differences, but I think I will enjoy it more and have more growth options (edit: its a technical marketing role). My wife also just started work (another \~$60,000/year). The last time I checked finances we just crossed $400,000, which felt like a big milestone. Hitting six figures in a taxable account just happened as well and this was very exciting.

**My recommendations**:

1. Use a budget. I have had a high savings rate thanks to budgeting.
2. Max out your 401k early (unless it is a terrible fund or something). It will hurt but you can get used to it.
3. Talk about earnings/career expectations before marriage. Create a budget together before getting married.
4. Invest in yourself. Doing part time grad school twice was a good career choice even though it was very difficult. My company paid for it both times.
5. Home ownership can be a great vehicle for wealth building. I found it stressful and detracted from work. Investing in myself and my career will likely end up being a better choice for me. YMMV.

Thanks for reading and for all of the encouragement that this community provides!

Edit: I got a question about NW allocation:

\- Savings: $50K (about to buy a car and move so have been hoarding cash for the last few months)

\- 401K: $185K

\- Roth IRA: $60K

\- Brokerage: $105K

Further edit: target number is $1.25 million. Probably another 12-15 years of work.  


Last edit: A fair number of comments about whether or not I was poor growing up. I grew up in a single-parent family as the youngest of four children. We were below the poverty line until I was at least 12 when a second sibling moved out. I was on free school lunches until it was just me and then I was on reduced school lunches. My mother was a saver who had a full-time job and always took part time gig work as well. So once she was able to save due to her kids moving out, she did. That is why she was able to loan me money at that point (20+ years from when my dad left her). I am sure that plenty of people have worse situations than mine, but I assure you, we were indeed poor when I was young. ",financialindependence

Long time lurker, I think a lot of ppl right now are making milestones with how things are going lol, so I figured to throw my hat in and make my first post. 

Raised by my single parent immigrant dad, we were somewhat middle class. Growing up he was really hard on me to do well academically, and I did OK, but honestly didn't do much homework and instead spent most of my time drawing n' posting (honestly pretty cringey) anime/furry art on deviantART starting from age 13. 

But I loved it and took art seriously enough in HS to end up going to art school. It was really expensive and we did not have any sort of college savings, BUT he did take on a lot of parent PLUS loans (which i'm eternally grateful for) while I took out the max in loans I could as a student. Spent the 4 years in college a lot more seriously than HS, knowing how much it cost, and did well. I got a bachelors in animation in '11 and got a job offer a year later to work in mobile games in a VHCOL area in '12. 

**May 2012 - Salary $48,000 -**  Started as a jr animator at a small mobile games start up. It was moderately successful and had just been acquired by a larger company. I got **RSU**s in the company as it was still privately held. **Fun Fact:** since this was my first big boy job I was reading a lot about how to budget a salary around then, and had read Elizabeth Warren's All Your Worth and got started saving in my 401k and Roth IRA because of it. 

**Nov 2014 - Salary  $60,000 -** It turns out those RSUs would be worth something! (around 20k) and all of them would vest immediately when our company got acquired by a public company. Our game was starting to really ramp up at this point, and there was a lot of bonuses and generous raises. I threw most of my windfalls/bonuses at my debt til I paid off all my loans, but my general savings rate was pretty low due to having to balance it with rent in the bay area.

**Jul 2016 - Salary $90,000 -** My salary jumped as I accepted a role in this same startup company as an art manager. We were growing really fast, and there was a need for a lot more artists at this point. This was also around the same time I had found this reddit board and realized ""hey, my salary has gone up a lot while my expenses have stayed pretty stable. This might be possible, although I still enjoy my job"" So I started pouring a lot more into my savings. Maxing out my 401k, my Roth IRA, and saving another 1k\~2k each month into VTSAX. I also get married soon after this point! 

**Jan 2018 - Salary $100,000 - NW $120,000 -** Uh oh, corporate sells the division I work at to a different corporate overlord. Lots of coworkers end up leaving, the culture at the company really starts changing. A game we were excited about gets canned. I'm not sure I even want to work in mobile games anymore as all of them have kind of moved towards very predatory ways of monetizing. But my job was honestly still pretty comfortable and I started really getting into FI/RE. Being frugal and still trying to do my best at work to grow my salary. At this point I set my mission to **save up 900k** and then quit my job **to work on indie games**. 

**Today - Salary $120,000 - NW $333,333 -** A lot of the same feelings from 2.5 years ago, but I've still stuck around at the same company. Just hunkering down and saving. I remember reading on the reddit here that the first 100k is the hardest to make, and then after that it gets much easier. Whoever said that was SO right. It's crazy watching all my investments grow lately.

**So what's next?** I've been setting aside money from each month from my very first paycheck to give to my dad to help repay those Parent PLUS loans. My rent (crazy enough) has not gone up since 2016, so my monthly spend is around 2500\~3000 per month (rent, bills, groceries, fun money) and the rest is saved up. My husband (also an animator) has had bouts on unemployment, but finally landed a stable job last year. He doesn't plan on retiring early at all, but is very supportive of me wanting to (very grateful for him too) . At the rate I'm going I think I'll be able to retire when i'm 36? In the mean time, i've been teaching myself to code and use various game developer tools. I'm still quite a novice in areas that aren't art related, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.   


**tl;dr-** 

* Dad took on a lot of my college expenses
* I graduated and got into an industry at the right time.
* Got into management via art to make 6 figures

205,FIRE in other Countries/ Currencys,,26,k5l0e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k5l0e6/fire_in_other_countries_currencys/,1606951109.0,"Hi, im writing from México and im also interested in FIRE.

I suppose the majority of posts around here come from the USA because I read a lot about 401k, Roth, IRA, etc. which im not really into it because from another countries, retirement plans are different.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Correct me if im wrong

I have read a lot about FIRE'ing at 1M (USD) with a ""4% interest rule"". As I understand that translates into 40k interest anually (or $3333.33)  which should be enough for living. (I know it depends on which city and a budget)

A major difference about México and USA from my perspective is the salary. Ive read normal salaries ranges from $40k-$120k USD anually (before taxes?) 

From perspective, lets suppose a person earns $80k salary, after taxes it is like $60k (I dont really know how much less) and from those 60k that persons spends 65% and saves 35% each month. That translates to $19.2k net savings. 

After some many years, saving, investment, etc one can reach the 1M or desired FIRE goal.

I dont know if this is right but im speculating. What am i missing?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, from México, a normal salary would be around $12.5k to 37.5k USD(Anually). I know theres a lot of difference vs USA but living costs (Food, rent, restaurants, medical expenses, etc) are much lower. 15k-18k should be enough for living in an average city in México. The only things that are ""kind of expensive"" to us mexicans with a salary 2-3 times lower because the cost the same here or there are not indispensable things like an Iphones, computers, cars, etc  or some other non basic somewhat imported stuff.

Lets take an example of a person that earns $25k, after taxes it is about $20k. And with an speding of 65% and saving rate of 35% it ends with $7k anually.

That same person needs almost as 3 times more to reach the same 1M.

According to the 4% (which is about the interest rate in México) to get 18k anually you would need 450k USD

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

450k USD is  is 2.22 times less that 1M but you would need: lets say 64 years at 7k per year saving rate) vs 52 years for 1M at 19.2k savings rate. So conclusion, you need more time for the desired FIRE number.

Those numbers are some aproach (I guess). Feel free to make any comparisons and discuss.",financialindependence

By any discernible measure, we could spend our days doing whatever we wish, which was the motivation for FI in the first place.  Yet, our respective grinds continue.  Neither of us are particularly enamored with our work but are highly competent and thus paid well.

We ratcheted down our lifestyle a while back ""to hasten FI"" ...  which flat out sucked.  So, we ratcheted up our lifestyle again ... which has been great and a return to normalcy for us.  And, 2.5% SWR is where we presently stand, even after re-inflating our lifestyle.

I daydream about hiking national parks, reading, oil painting, learning a new instrument or volunteering my time for financial literacy causes.  Instead, I find myself making (SUPER) dull drives across the Midwest, making sales calls and staying in Marriott Courtyards.  The corporate minions are pleased but, more and more, I am not.

To change things up with work, I recently moved to a sexier division (more attractive technology) and this does not seem to be hitting the mark either.  It is the same game with a different widget and a bigger paycheck.  It is exceedingly difficult to stay motivated when we have already won the game.

If anyone has been in a similar situation then I am all ears.  How did you get off of the hamster wheel?

208,Software for maximizing Roth conversion efficiency,,8,k5dwjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k5dwjp/software_for_maximizing_roth_conversion_efficiency/,1606930501.0,"I recently took early retirement (59) and am looking for software that can help me maximize the financial efficiency of Roth conversions over the next few years.

I just collected a lump sump pension, so I'm pretty much done working (own my own home worth about $500k) and have about $5m invested.  My wife and I will both receive small pensions (total <$500/mo) and social security.  My dilemma is that I have about $3.5m in pre-tax (IRA) money (I know - a good problem to have).  I also have about $500k in Roth and the remainder is in an after-tax account.  I know the best financial plan is to start converting IRA to Roth, but the big question is how much should I be converting per year.  I know my decisions now will affect tax rates and Medicare surcharges years down the line as well as affect the eventual (I hope) inheritance to my heirs.

Is there any good software out there that can automatically (or even manually) run simulations and give me an idea what the best strategy would be to do Roth conversions now?  Ideally, it would know about the tax law changes coming in 2025 and Social Security / Medicare rules.  

I've signed up for MaxiFi - it's OK, but isn't really what I want.  I had a CPA demo eMoney software for me that seemed really good, but it wasn't ""hand's on"" - I'd have to hire him for many thousands a year to gain access to the output.  I'm looking for something I can own / run myself - ideally online, and ideally one that can pull in data from various sources (Fidelity Investments, my bank, social security) so it can update as my financial situation updates (Note: I use a Mac).",financialindependence

210,9.1% Permanent Reduction In Social Security Benefits To The 4 Million Turning 60 In 2020 Due to COVID-19 - Misleading,,154,k4rlv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k4rlv8/91_permanent_reduction_in_social_security/,1606849619.0,"**Update:** It turns out the headline is not misleading as pointed out below by /u/gregable

# Background

A co-worker sent me an article I can't seem to link to properly - https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20200912157/a-drop-in-social-securitys-average-wage-index-could-hurt-four-million-people The article purports that the affect of COVID-19 in 2020 will permanently reduce their Social Security benefits by 9.1% because of the [Adjusted Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  I read the article and found that while a good portion of it was sound, the conclusions were misleading.  I am posting here for two reasons:

* I am hoping the community can help substantiate and/or refute the article and my interpretation of it
* I assume most still working FIRE folks don't give much weight to social security (nice to have) and I also assume that they are aiming for pre-60 retirement.  On the other hand, Social Security is a complicated beast to understand so by sharing why I think this article is misleading, I am also helping to educate for those who want to understand.

# How Social Security Is Calculated

I actually found [this article](https://www.fool.com/retirement/whats-the-social-security-benefit-formula.aspx) and the [ssa.tools](https://ssa.tools/calculator.html) results easier to understand than what was on the SSA website.

# Step 1 - Determine Your Wages For Each Year

This can be done using the [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/) website and going to your earnings history.  A couple of things to note:

* If you are a high wage earner, you may find that the amount reflected in a given year is less than you actually earned - this is because there is a maximum each year after which income is no longer considered for social security purposes
* These are starting values - they get adjusted in the next step

# Step 2 - Adjust The Wages For Inflation

**This** is the step the article is saying will result in a permanent 9.1% drop in benefits but I believe is misleading.  This is done using the [Average Wage Index](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  Things I think the article got right

* The year that matters is the year you turn 60 (2 years prior to being first eligible)
* 2020 will very likely be lower than originally predicted.  The article says:  The [2020 Trustees Report](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2020/index.html) projected that the AWI, which equals total wages in the year divided by the number of wage earners, would increase by 3.5% from 2019 to 2020.  It later goes on to say: experience so far in 2020 suggests that total wages will be about 10% lower than projected in the 2020 Trustees Report and the number of workers will be about 1% lower than projected. (The number of workers doesn't decline very much because AWI includes all wage earners even if they only worked for the month of January.) If these percentage declines play out, then the average wage index will be 9.1% (1 -- 90/99) lower than projected for 2020  
* The affect will be permanent for those turning 60 this year without legislation (the article mentions 2 bills already created to address)


What I disagree with in the article is:  *Assuming these declines come to pass, about four million people will receive benefits that are 9.1% less than expected*



Instead, I think it should read:  Assuming these declines come to pass, about four million people will receive benefits that are **based on earnings** 9.1% less than expected.

**I have already made this section long enough because this is the crux of the issue but suffice it to say, the AWI is used to adjust the earnings history from step 1**

# Step 3 - Calculate Your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

* Identify the highest 35 earning years from step 1 after applying step 2
* Divide the sum by 35 and then again by 12

**This is what you made on-average per month through your 35 highest earning years and will be what your SS benefit will be based on**

# Step 4 - Identify Your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

You can think of the next step almost like reverse tax brackets.  Essentially a progressively smaller portion of your AIME contributes to your benefit amount.  There are only 3 brackets - called bend points.  [Here is a table of them](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/bendpoints.html) as they change each year.  I will use 2021 for the purposes of the example applying [the PIA formula](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html):

* 90% of the first $996
* 32% of any amount between $998 and $6002
* 15% of any amount above $6002

# Step 5 Adjust for Cost Of Living &amp; Age Of Starting Benefits

[Cost Of Living Adjustments](https://www.ssa.gov/cola/) apply but aren't really germane to the conversation.  Additionally, the amount of your PIA (monthly benefit) is adjusted based on the age you retire.  For most everyone, the PIA in the previous step is based on starting benefits at age 67.  You can take benefits as early as 62.  The benefits can even increase beyond the PIA in the previous step if you delay taking the benefits past 67 but it maxes out at age 70.

# Conclusion

Because of the way the bend points work, I don't believe the impact of the AWI in 2020 can have the impact the article suggests.  Social Security is intentionally capped in two ways

* There is a maximum amount you can earn in any given year that counts towards social security
* The last bend point is set to 15% meaning you only get 15 cents for every dollar earned above that bend point.

I did one calculation based off a AIME of 8333 (100K annually) and the difference was a hair under 4% - still substantial and worth fighting over but less than half of the number claimed by the article.

# What did I miss?

I am going to share this post with my co-worker so please provide any comments about mistakes I made or things that would be worth adding.

**Update:** As pointed out by /u/gregable below, the bend points are also tied to the AWI which means the article was not misleading after all.  2020's AWI (age 60) will be reflected in the 2022 bend points (age 62).  I had incorrectly assumed they were unrelated since it appears as 2021 values are already out when in reality they are tied to 2019's AWI.",financialindependence
211,Roth 401k for Roth Conversion Ladders?,,55,k4xw8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k4xw8v/roth_401k_for_roth_conversion_ladders/,1606868483.0,"Hello all! I think I understand the general principal of a Roth Conversion Ladder. But I have a few questions.

1. If you retired at age 45, you couldn’t begin making conversions from a 401k/IRA into a Roth IRA until that year, right? Those first 5 years of retirement, you’d need to live off Roth IRA contributions, Taxable Brokerage Accounts, and Cash, right?

2. How does a Roth Conversion Ladder work if you have lots of $$ in a Roth 401k? Is it all the same except you don’t pay tax on the money when it’s converted? Just wanting to make sure I understand that as it would guide my investing strategy a bit if I couldn’t do this ladder conversion with a Roth 401k.

3. If the answer to the above is that you CAN do this sort of conversion... I understand the theory of wanting to make sure you convert enough $$ 5 years ahead of time that you can live off of it. But can someone explain why you’ve wouldn’t just convert more every year? I understand in a traditional 401k conversion that you’d end up paying more in taxes if you did like $200k In one year vs $40k over 5 years. But not so if it was coming from a post tax source. You could just roll over the entirety of the Roth 401k into a Roth IRA and after 5 years, withdraw it? Do I need to wait 5 years still?

I’m considering the idea of ceasing contributions to those accounts (403bs for each and Roth IRAs) and putting all our extra money into other investments.  The 450k is reallocated each year following the bogleheads 3 fund strategy, but a bit heavier on VTSAX.

We also own a 4plex (180k at purchase) which about breaks even and a townhouse (250k) at purchase.  Rents are 3,000 and 1850 per month, respectively.

If we don’t contribute anymore to the retirement accounts I figure that when I’m 62, we’ll have just over 2MM in retirement fund assuming 6% annual growth.  And I think that’s enough.

In a nutshell, if your parents ran themselves flat broke because they were irresponsible - and yet you were very responsible and FIRE’d, your state may be able to come after your hard-earned finances too.  Your parents credit card debts may not be able to be transferred to you, but depending on your state their medical costs potentially could.

Has anyone consulted with a lawyer or trust attorney in order to build strategies to protect assets from these types of cases?  I wonder whether certain asset classes are beyond reach - such as retirement accounts, and a home.

218,"Time value of money, how much is your day worth? A new perspective",,0,k47gdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k47gdr/time_value_of_money_how_much_is_your_day_worth_a/,1606776799.0,"# Rule of 3600

""$1 today is worth $15 in 40 years"" doesn't really capture well what investing a dollar today actually means in terms of your goals. Most of us here aren't trying to buy more stuff, we're trying to buy time and freedom.

So, what does time cost? The formula is quite simple:

**cost\_of\_one\_day = net\_worth\_dollars / 3600**

This means if your net worth is **$3,600**, investing **$1** buys you **1 day of retirement** in the future, no matter your target number or age. This way of seeing things captures why it's so important to invest when your net worth is low (usually applies to young people). When your net worth is **$1,000,000**, it takes **$278** to buy **1 day of retirement** in the future. This gives some perspective of what it costs in terms of time to continue working; if someone works **250 days** a year and dumps their whole income into investments, they would need to earn **$69,500 net** to break even, otherwise they're valuing security or money over their time (that's okay, just be conscious of it), or because they enjoy their job more than retiring.

**Formula #2**

**days\_each\_dollar\_buys = 3600 / net\_worth\_dollars**

# How?

Each year of investing has an **expected return of 7%** of your net worth. This translates to **0.028%** per working day (**250** in a year), which is roughly 1/3571 or **\~1/3600**. So for each **$3,600** invested, you're expected to make **\~$1** per day on the stock market. By investing additional money, you're buying guaranteed returns; at $3,600 invested, you're buying 1 day of guaranteed returns with each dollar.

# Applied to investment psychology

**Stock market crashes and corrections**

When the stock market crashes or corrects, your net worth drops, and each additional dollar invested buys more time than before the crash/correction. Remember this, and you'll be psychologically inclined to buy low.

**CoastFIRE**

At a certain dollar amount, a person might decide that they value spending those dollars than have an extra day of freedom in their life. I think most people would say that they'd rather have an extra day of freedom than spend $1. Probably the same for $10. Maybe at $100 per day, some people might say no they'd rather have fun with friends, family, or buy/experience something they always wanted than have an extra day. If $100 is that threshold, then your CoastFIRE number is $360,000. If you have absolutely nothing to do with free time, such as just wasting your day browsing Reddit, ask yourself ""would I pay $100 at $360,000 net worth to browse Reddit for a whole day?"" This should hit hard on some people, because retirement is pretty boring if you don't develop hobbies to do once you pull the trigger. The more fulfilling your life currently is, the higher your CoastFIRE number should be (e.g. I would pay $500 for an extra day of cycling the Alpes vs. $5 for an extra day of browsing Reddit/sitting around/mindless activity), and vice-versa. Psychologically, this helps people with boring lives spend more/develop hobbies, and people with more exciting lives value investing more. It naturally settles onto a sweet spot.

**Asset allocation**

The higher the expected returns of an investment, the high the risk, and the more costly it is to buy a day of time. This helps adjust risk too as you approach FIRE. If you're investing in a high flying tech stock that returns 30% a year, then the rule of 3600 becomes the rule of 833. This means that at $200,000 invested, it already costs $240 to buy a day of time with that tech stock; perhaps it's more worth it to buy VTI/VTSAX for $55 a day at that point, or even earlier? Then let's say you have $400,000 invested in 50% tech and 50% VTI, your average daily cost of time is $295. If you're earning less than $295 per day, you're taking too much risk with that portfolio. Let's say you earn $240 a day net, so you want to rebalance to get your average daily cost of time to $240; sell $61,325 of tech, and buy VTI with it, now you have $139,675 of tech and $261,325 of VTI. The goal of financial independence is to reach average daily cost of time equal to your daily net income with a portfolio of 100% VTI, and whenever your portfolio has an average daily cost higher than your daily net income, it gives you a sign that you should de-risk. After FIRE, this could mean setting up bond tents, having 1-2 years expenses in cash, investing in hedge funds for the very rich.

PS: this method works for almost any investment. For example, BTC. It returns on average 130-140% a year. That's a rule of 260. If you're earning $100 a day net, your max investment in BTC should not exceed $26,000. If you're ""investing"" in call options which have an expected 3x return in a month, that's a rule of 0.0006868118945. If you're earning $100 a day net, then your max allocation to that call option should be around 7 cents, otherwise you're taking too much risk (i.e. gambling). In other words, unless you're earning $145,600 a day after taxes, you should never buy even a single call option contract of that kind (\~$100).",financialindependence

I don't really care about the pay too much.. But I am not ready to work for free. I just want to be productive, and mentally challenged at work, but then be able leave all of that and not deal with it when I come home.

I don't like the idea of being a freelancer, because then I need to negotiate how much money I will be paid, which I don't really care about. I'd prefer a project where I don't have much responsibility to a deliver a project, and instead I would prefer to be an advisor or teacher.

At the same time, I recognize, we can now afford certain services that we previously have not done much because we felt it was too expensive. A few examples:

1. Having people clean our place. (Because it gets overwhelming with kids to keep it clean.)
2. Having prepared foods be delivered to us regularly. (Although we try cooking once in a while, it is not something we really enjoy doing. And we are concerned about our kids eating healthy.)
3. Going on more vacations.
4. Getting a nanny/babysitter supplimenting the daycare.
5. Donate more money.

Currently we continue to go the same path and accumulate wealth, and are starting to spend more on the things listed above, but as the wealth accumulates, I keep getting a stronger urge to change my job to something else.. but I don't know to what.",financialindependence

I even posted a while ago about the best way to split the purchase of a home with my partner, and overwhelmingly people say it's much riskier to buy a house with a non-married partner than with a married partner. 

If there are protections, then why are pre-nup agreements recommended? It seems to me that if you're worried about pre-nups, then an option (if both people are fine with it) is to not get married and simply be cohabiting partners. But I've read and been told that purchasing assets with someone that you're not married to is risky.

So I'm trying to better understand what protections marriage offer and what they can't protect that a pre-nup could.

I used to think work was what woke me up at night, but realized that my mind is naturally anxious and then anything really took work’s place in my mind - sometimes much more concerning stuff. As such, the motivation to drop work to feel more at peace isn’t something I’ll achieve in RE. Maybe the problem is just me here, not my career nor my clients. And in a way, that anxiety is easier because it’s not really existential. So I’m getting to a stage where I’m thinking doing some work on the side to coast my way through (even beyond FIRE) might be a better option - keep my mind busy, find reasons to look at other problems than my own, etc.

I wanted to update it. I am still struggling.  I write this post AGAIN on here because I truly respect the POVs on here. If you choose to read this, please be honest. If need be, put me in my place.

-

TLDR: I STILL really am struggling to find a new challenge. I have been applying to positions but I am not having much success finding the right opportunity. I still have different and specific goals but I am unable to get them on my current path.

-

- How do people get motivated, again, after being out on their own for 4-5 years? 

-

Here are some more updates/realizations in my life:

1. We had our second child this year. We're unlikely to have another one.
2. I am still in my mid 30s.
3. I got too comfortable, I want a challenge again.
4. Our health insurance and benefits are subpar.
5. Net Worth is about $1.9 MM and the balance sheet is below.
6. We don't own our primary residence, we rent. We have been displaced due to COVID.

-

I really don't like my current business. It is more of a good side gig. I am not challenged by it either. I would rather coast with it now and find a more challenging opportunity, even if that means working for someone else.  I have been looking for a new opportunity for over year and I am struggling to find the right fit. I am not looking for a high salary, but I would really good benefits because our current health insurance is subpar and I have already had serious health issues. My goal is to be ""done"" by 45 and simply manage my business.

-

Here are my specific questions:

1. Does anyone have specific suggestions about the transition back into the system (going from being on your own to working for someone else)?

2. Does anyone have any coping suggestions about the transition? I am concerned that I am going to miss my young children so much. Working from home allows some great benefits.

3. How long did it take you to readjust?

4. Were your able to readjust?

225,Calculating SWR With Large Expected Social Security Benefit,,209,k1uizn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k1uizn/calculating_swr_with_large_expected_social/,1606452249.0,"I realize this is probably ""in the weeds"" for all those except the few out there in a similar situation as we are: Those retired or retiring in their 50s with a sizable Social Security balance...and trying to figure out how much to add to the 3.5% (or 3.25%) safe withdrawal rate (SWR) we apply to our net investable assets exclusive of the SS. The purpose of this post is to share our approach and see if others have any other methods they might find useful. It probably also goes without saying that poking holes in our thinking is fair game and appreciated :-). 

Some stats:

\>>M/57 and F/52 retired early 2019

\>>$1.9M net worth

\>>$1.6M Investable Assets (which we use to calculate our SWR...the remainder of NW being our home which we own outright).

\>>$75k/yr (today's dollars) Expected Social Security at m/70 f/65 with net present value (NPV) of $1.2M.

\>>30 year horizon. (Our plan is to make certain that the surviving spouse will have paid for home, $43k/yr SS + residual portfolio which will not allow to dip below at least a few hundred thousand dollars. 

\>>We plan to recalculate our SWR annually with a strong commitment to reducing spending if our investable assets drop substantially. We are in a fortunate position in that we would be ok with 75% of our current budget if conditions required it. This does allow us to take on a bit more risk in choosing a SWR.

If you retire very early, the SS doesn't add much to your SWR. If you retire later, you can just add your SS benefit you're already receiving to your SWR. But we're in the middle, where we have to span 13 more years to SS but want to work out a SWR that will be fairly flat for our entire retirement (though it will be funded mostly from our investments for the next 13 years and mostly from SS after that).

We've used three methods to perform these calculations. Interestingly, they all tell a similar story (which I guess is good).  (Of course we're bracing for any possible cuts to Social Security...and will adjust accordingly. But every year that goes by seems to make it more likely the changes won't affect our demographic...or if so, not much. I'm not of the opinion it will be politically feasible to just apply a 25% or whatever cut to those on SS or those close to receiving it.)

Here's what we used for SWR to reach our $105k budget for next year:

1) Backing into SWR via trial/error on [Firecalc.com](https://Firecalc.com). This method yields a SWR of around $95k (5.9%) flat or $105 to start backing down to $85K in the out years. (The ""success rate"" we were shooting for here was 95%+. This seems comfortable in that we're ready to reduce our budget as soon as next year if the market dips.)

2) Using the NPV of our Social Security account ($1.2M) as additive to our Investable Assets ($1.6M) and applying 3.5% = $98k SWR. (I realize the SS account underperforms bonds in terms of asset allocation on average, though by pacing inflation it's actually currently significantly outperforming any ""safe"" bonds or other fixed income investments. Still this probably suggests that this estimate is a little high and a somewhat lower SWR should be used.

3) ERN's tool. ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/)) It also yielded the most generous SWR of 6.3% when we calculated it last year. ERN show three levels of risk. The lowest level resulted in 5.4% SWR, the middle 6.3% and the riskiest 6.8%. We used the middle and that works out to around $104k SWR. (Note: ERN's shortest retirement period was 40 years, which we used.)

We're at the higher end of these estimates with a $105k budget for 2021....but feel that's offset by the fact we're not locking in a spending number for more than a year. We plan to 100% start over determining our SWR for 2022 with effectively no minimums. This also will effectively stretch our retirement horizon to a new 30 years each year, adding safety. 

Any other tools out there you're using? Are we looking at this wrong in any way? It's not too late to lower that budget for 2021! :-)",financialindependence

228,How does it feel to have two commas? My Thanks,,1469,k1d0gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k1d0gp/how_does_it_feel_to_have_two_commas_my_thanks/,1606386912.0,"Today I woke up with something to definitely be thankful for. I saw that I officially became a member of the two comma (or dot/space) club. How does it feel? To be honest, it feels exactly the same as it did when my NW still had one comma. 

I don’t make six or seven figures. I don’t have any crypto. Not a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or other high earner. I still make a five figure base salary as I did when I got my first “real paying” job.  For the curious, mostly admin office stuff, new media, and resource mgmt).  20s underemployed and drowning in med bills, yada, yada, yada.

My allocation is approx. 34%ish 401k, 52%ish 3 fund brokerage (VTSAX, VBTLX, VTIAX), 12%ish jumbo CD, and the rest in cash. 

My tastes and hobbies are still the same. Still have bills to pay. Still appreciate the same things: peace of mind, friends and family, cooking and eating, and enjoying new people, places, and experiences.

I don’t fully subscribe to some of the FI beliefs I see in the sub like the remaining in a particular paying job despite the high levels of job dissatisfaction and the constant questions of how one would fill their time if not working. I am ok with my job, and have plenty of outside hobbies and interests to keep me busy. In fact, I am still planning a leave of absence soon to be able to spend more time with family and in my causes. Pandemic be darned. 

All said, I still have a ways to go in reaching my goals though.

Here are things I wish I knew earlier in this journey:

Start saving and investing as early as you can. Really, as early as you can. Compounding is no joke. When I got my first real job offer, I did not sign up for 401k deductions. I now see that as a mistake. Three years and a few more jobs and unemployment periods later, I signed up for the max deductions in my new job and have been maxing it out in my jobs since. 

Don’t be afraid of a little risk.  A month after my first 401k deduction, I saw my balance declining. I freaked out and moved my money into a safer fund (but did not reduce my contributions). The money later recovered with the market and then some. This pattern would repeat over the years. Now I know that this is normal, and that we need to be in it for the long haul.

Speaking of risk, after discovering this sub three years ago I decided to open a brokerage account and slowly dump my money in there. Lots more fluctuations than my 401k but I stayed in. Good move clearly. I now see I had nothing to fear in opening an account. 

Take care of your health. Medical bills are killer.  I spent my 20s underemployed and broke, plus drowning in 10s of thousands of dollars of medical bills. The collectors are simply vicious. It took me years just to get to 0. Taking care of your health also puts you in a position to maximize work opportunities.  For one of my temp jobs it required a special physical to make sure I could handle the job.  If I failed that due to bad health, I’d not be where I am today. 

Be open minded and adventurous. I have taken jobs in the past 10 years that have come my way completely by surprise. Like that one I mentioned about the special physical. All were amazing experiences. While some I would not do again, I appreciate the experience and memories I got from them. 

Know your limits and when to stop. I have quit a few jobs too over bad bosses, bad and toxic working conditions, and when I saw the job weighing on my health. No job is worth your life. Be prepared to walk away for yourself and family if need be.

Frugal is ok. This is me. I have always been frugal. Growing up living in the projects had a part in that. But also I don’t put a lot of stock in collecting material things. I like doing things with people, from walking around together to home cooking together. These cost much less than other things. 

Value and focus on experiences and people over money and possessions. Nuff said. 

That’s my very long story in a nutshell. I may update as needed.",financialindependence

# Account Values

I started working weeks before the Lehman collapse. Didn't really know what was happening at the time. My NW before 2014 are all estimates as I was not tracking anything during that time period.

Salary and Bonus from early years are estimates. 

&#x200B;

**2008: -$20,000.**Salary: 65k | Bonus: 0k

Student loans, irresponsible credit card debt accrued in college killed me the first few months of adult life. $65k entry salary.

**2009: $25,000**Salary: 65k | Bonus: 25k

A sign on bonus, year end bonus, and tax return wiped out most of my credit card debt

**2010: $60,000**Salary: 75k| Bonus: 15k

Was making about $100,000 at this point. Didn't save anything as I was partying but decent investments propelled my net worth up

**2011: $100,000**Salary: 85k | Bonus: 25k

More of the same

**2012: $170,000**Salary: 100k | Bonus: ??

Started some side hustles that took off but really didn't save much still.

**2013: $220,000**Salary: 100k | Bonus: ??

Continued side hustles and started saving some more money.

**2014: $280,000**Salary: 110k | Bonus: ??

Combination of market returns, decent savings, and continued side hustles propelled me further up

**2015: $350,000**Salary: 120k | Bonus: 30k

Bought an apartment, discovered FI/RE. Race was on. Started maxing out 401k.

**2016: $475,000**Salary: 140k | Bonus: 50k

70% savings rate and market returns really helped, also real estate appreciation

**2017: $650,000**Salary: 150k | Bonus $50k

More of the same, making over $200k by this point, and market returns helped, real estate appreciation

**2018: $760,000**Salary: $160k | Bonus $55k

More of the same, market drop in equities and real estate

**2019: $875,000S**Salary: 120k euro | 30k euro

Moved to Europe. More of the same, got a lot of extra cash flow from relocation bonuses and performance bonuses from moving to Europe. Making about 150k euros which turns out is MUCH better than making 200k in NYC.

**2020: $1,080,000**Salary: 120k euro | 30k euro

Had a decent cash bonus at the beginning of the year and put it towards the market at the right time. Bought heavy in some tech ETFs which have nearly 2x'd since.

**2021 Outlook: $1,150,000**

I had a package offer on the table to leave and took it which will be quite a nice reprieve. I think the timing isn't ideal because i'd have preferred to just wait until the pandemic was over because there's not much to do right now. I didn't want to wait around for company's minds to change so better now than never. Plus, I'm confident i could always find something else if that's what I feel like doing.

&#x200B;

# Portfolio Breakdown 

Here is a breakdown of my current figures. Not exact figures but rough amounts. My portfolio mostly invested in broad market ETFs, and a chunk of tech ETFs. Few single name stocks just to keep things interesting.

**Cash:** 10k

**Brokerage Account:** $600k

**IRA:** $180k

**Roth IRA:** $20k

**Home Equity:** $250-300k (plan to sell this house in the next year)

**Credit card points** \~ $20k (I engage heavily in churning)

&#x200B;

# What to FIRE to?

I think the most important part of FIRE is the age-old saying to retire to **something**. It's countless times now that I've read on this sub of people having FIRE'd, getting bored, losing their way, and being a lost soul. Then there are some people that genuinely can just do nothing, but that's not me.

I always knew from day one that as soon as I FIRE'd, it would be to pursue my real interests and passions. If these interests and passions lead me to another career where I make money, then so be it, I still consider myself FIRE because I know i can peace out if I lost interest. As someone planning to FIRE in their mid 30s, it's imperative to have this figured out as doing nothing from here on out is a surefire way to an early death.

My passion has always been to travel the world full time, work as a dive instructor and have some sort of travel consultancy business. I have a blog and travel business that was on track to generate $20k+ in 2020 but as soon as COVID taking flight in March, traffic and revenue fell 60-70%. The dive industry is completely decimated because no one can travel so don't expect any cool instructor positions to open up any time soon.

It's safe to say that all of those things are on hold for the foreseeable future so whatever I was planning to FIRE to is uncertain now. It's a strange and unfamiliar feeling because as a person, I've always looked to the future, often times in a daydreaming type of way. Now, I am firmly grounded to the present, not knowing what the future holds or when the future can take place.

&#x200B;

# What to do now?

So as I write this post, I'm at my beautiful little boutique hotel on Zanzibar Island. They're open to tourists and although I've been here in the past, it's an absolute heaven right now with so few tourists and everything being half off.

I've been here for a few weeks now and have mostly been diving, chilling out, and working on the blog. In my mind, it beats being locked down in the cold back in Europe and gives me time to figure out what to do next. Plus it's just beautiful here.

For expenses, I always targeted $40k yearly expenses which I think will go quite far in most of the world, although not very far if I'm trying to go on safaris and shit in Africa. This was between a 3.5-4% withdrawal rate. My blog was looking to supplement this 50% or so but now it's more like 20% (but still better than nothing).

Think for now, I will chill here and wait it out until othe rparts of the world open and see what happens. But it would appear that I'm FIRE'd and wasn't sure how I felt about it at first but with these views, I can't complain!",financialindependence
230,This year I am grateful for $1M at age 32,,112,k14n8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k14n8y/this_year_i_am_grateful_for_1m_at_age_32/,1606350425.0,"Hello FIRE People!

First, you all have been a constant source of ~~jealousy~~ inspiration for YEARS. I read this forum every day. I always dreamed of writing one of these posts and honestly didn't have a particular milestone planned for it but today I surpassed a personal net worth of $1 million dollars for the first time and the inspiration struck as I was going through my calculations. So, here I am. Get ready to see every stereotype rolled into one in this post so just buckle *the fuck* up. Shoutout to /r/fijerk.

Now... the goods. Current rounded breakdowns of my personal net worth:

$85,000 cash

$15,000 car equity

$130,000 real estate equity

$10,000 in bonds (mutual funds)

$390,000 in stock (mutual funds)

$270,000 in individual stocks (small positions in tech that grew exponentially - mainly Tesla \*shocked Pikachu face\*)

$100,000 in crypto (small investment that grew exponentially)

Total: approximately $1,000,000

How? Tons of amazing opportunity, a genuine love of technology (and great jobs in the tech industry), a ton of luck, steadfast frugality, and relentless investing... Step by step:

1. Graduated college in 2011 without debt due to choosing a state school, financial aid, scholarships, family support, and a couple summer internships (one unpaid, two paid). 
2. 10 years in the tech industry. Started strong ($72,000 a year total compensation), moved companies three times, and was promoted once. Current compensation is now $150,000 a year after all that. I have never taken more than 1 week off between jobs and always had the next thing lined up.
3. I watched all the people my age at the tech companies I worked for spend money on eating out, fancy apartments, brand-new cars. I got a low-end apartment with roommates even after I got my first real job. Most my happiness came from spending time with my frugal spouse, playing sports, basic tech items like phones/video games, and my dog that I got after 1 year working. I still ate very cheaply and never ordered alcohol out. This left lots of money for maxing all my tax advantaged accounts, further index fund stock investing, and then that 5% or so for the high risk ""fun"" investments that I happened to hit on.
4. I read about technology every day for fun via a simple news aggregator. I scan the headlines and then usually end up reading 3-4 articles a day that interest me. I always try and think about what will affect the world the most and how it will do so... and whether or not there is an investing angle that the general public isn't yet privy to. 
5. Put most my money in 100% stock index funds as I started out as kind of an aggressive boglehead and still am in a lot of ways. As years passed I put 5% or so into ""fun""/high risk investing when I saw something cool crop up. Learned about crypto in late 2013 during the bull run up to $1,000. Invested a tiny bit of money in bitcoin near the top there and got burned - watched the price cut in half. Doubled down and never looked back (wish I had continued to dollar cost average but c'est la vie). 3 years later I finally crossed into the profitable range but continued to hold! I am a Tesla fan so over the last few years I have slowly thrown a few hundred dollars into $TSLA here and there for fun once my retirement accounts were all maxed out for the year. Looked at it as a potential charitable investment to try and help the environment and also maybe a fun fund to buy a cool car someday if it did well. Watched it stagnate for years and then eventually now this huge run-up has propelled my net worth substantially (better make the post quick before the 7 figures NW goes away!!!).

Alright... so... what? Are my take-a-ways going to be that different than everyone else's? Not really but here is my spin on it anyways.

1. **You don't have to fit in with the crowd.** I am a FIRE zealot amongst my friends and that provides an interesting perspective in the corporate world. I always try to pay my own way and (especially now) find times to be generous, but I also try and steer my friends to make responsible financial choices and overall it has been good for my social relationships.
2. **Your spouse is going to almost assuredly be the most important person in your life.** I met my significant other at a young age. When we were in college, we had no money so we got used to spending nothing and still enjoying each other's company. She is frugal too and has her own story to share. She has quite the impressive portfolio and net worth herself and we have ultimately bonded over money. It is amazing to have a hard working and financially supportive partner. 
3. **Most hobbies can be accomplished within very reasonable budgets if you plan well and only purchase things you are really going to use.** Animals are awesome. Sports are fun. Music is amazing. Video games can provide near infinite entertainment. There are a lot of cool things to spend your time on that are cheap per hour of entertainment provided (and aren't $10 drinks at the bar). Even if you love the bars, you can go to most bars with your friends for free. Be the designated driver. Drink at home and walk/lyft out to the bars with your friends (once COVID is under control, of course). It's not that big of a deal to plan a bit.
4. **Invest and Invest EARLY!** The first money I earned and paid taxes on at an internship went into a Roth IRA immediately. I maxed all my retirement accounts in year 1 of my first real job and didn't increase my lifestyle nearly at all except for social obligations with new coworkers (and even then, I found the cheapest way to do everything while still pulling my weight). Despite the fact it now looks like I am some Tesla/Crypto dude, I started out with basically ALL broad based index funds for *years*. My cost basis in real estate/index funds is probably $400,000-$500,000 while my cost basis in individual stocks/crypto is probably $40,000 after 10 years.
5. **Find hobbies that make you money!** I love looking at real estate. My spouse and I bought a property and rented out extra rooms. We made some money on rent, we made some money on appreciation. We have had quite a few small headaches and inconveniences but it still has been an adventure, and a profitable one! Plus we have learned a lot.
6. **Set a goal, give yourself a reasonable reward!** You don't have to spend nothing. I just try not to waste anything. Over time, dogs are expensive. I wanted a dog anyways. Once I had a steady job and a positive performance review under my belt, I adopted a dog! Worth every penny. After 8 years, I upgraded my reliable used car to my first new car - I just plan to keep it for 15 years and take care of it.

**TL;DR: Went to a state school and utilized whatever combination of resources I could to graduate college without debt. Found a reasonably lucrative job and supportive, frugal spouse. Lived cheaply/""house hacked"" and enjoyed people/animals/cheap hobbies. Invested as much and as early as possible in broad based mutual funds. YOLOed a few bucks on crypto and tech stocks and held on for dear life (got lucky and had it grow a lot). Overall, saved over $1M in the 10 years since college and became a walking FIRE stereotype.**

OH WAIT. I forgot. Am I fucking myself yet? I mean... Am I going to go fuck myself? Not yet! With a combined net worth of \~$1.6M, my spouse and I consider ourselves generally financially independent (as of the last couple months) but I like my job and want plenty of buffer since a large part of our net worth is in extremely volatile investments. We have been lucky because during the pandemic we have stayed healthy and been able to work from home, which has been a nice change of pace for us. My spouse is currently pregnant so she is going to quit first! We are going to see how she feels after maternity leave but she basically is welcome to leave her job whenever she feels ready (she has worked her ASS off). I will likely follow when I no longer enjoy my work or we have hit a combined NW in the early $2 million range. I hope to FIRE by age 35 with at least a $70,000 a year budget (3.5% withdrawal rate) in the suburbs. Thank you for all the advice over the years and for reading my long post!",financialindependence

232,Fun Tradition for Wealth Milestones,,306,k0x4wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k0x4wx/fun_tradition_for_wealth_milestones/,1606327138.0,"After seeing some posts a few months ago about people collecting items to signify wealth milestones, my wife(27) and I(29) decided to do the same. Our net worth recently reached a major landmark and it seemed like a good time to start. We decided at each $10k milestone we would buy a bottle of wine to enjoy in celebration. We would then write the date and wealth milestone number on the cork, and drop it in a large glass jug we found at Target. We are keeping the jug on our bedroom dresser, and it actually looks pretty great. We decided to write the wealth number in roman numerals to subtly avoid questions in case anyone takes a good look at the corks. I've linked a couple pictures of our set-up below.

[https://imgur.com/a/PJLX3JG](https://imgur.com/a/PJLX3JG)

I think this tradition will work well for us. The bottle of wine, and the satisfaction of dropping another cork in the jug, acts as a carrot on a string.

Happy savings, and happy thanksgiving!

For clarification, these $10k milemarkers will certainly have to change as our portfolio grows. For now, this seems like the right amount for us given where we’re at. Also, we’re using a “high watermark” approach where we won’t celebrate the same milestone twice, but only those which are new all time highs.",financialindependence

If you choose the right location and the smaller home isnt particularly terrible why wont it rise in price the same way? I could always sell the smaller home and move up right?

241,When life compels you to dampen the flames of FIRE,,436,jzi8uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jzi8uk/when_life_compels_you_to_dampen_the_flames_of_fire/,1606140579.0,"I suppose most people have had a strange year in 2020, but for me it has been particularly odd.  I've been actively chasing FIRE with my partner for the last ~5 years, and expected to be working on it for another 5-10 years (but said too much on my main, so here's a burner!)


Part of that plan was always to have one or two children, and I knew that would present a challenge - after all, they're not cheap, even if you're frugal, and although we could potentially both achieve pay rises to balance out the effects, it was a massive unknown.  That was a driver for RE, though, so that I could be actively involved in their lives.


In the event it has taken quite a different turn.  My daughter was born in March, and has been quite unwell ever since her birth.  To cut a long story short, her condition is very poorly understood (because it is so unbelievably rare), but the world-leading expert who is now responsible for her care believes that it can only improve - and potentially the point that no-one would know she was ill.  How long that may take is anyone's guess, but we're probably talking about a few years.


Concurrently, my employer has been quite flexible, and they gave me 6 months off to deal with the immediate aftermath.  In October they agreed to give me another 6 months off, although this time at 50% rather than 100% of pay, which I immediately accepted.  I don't know right now if I'll be able to go back at the end of that, but I also don't feel like I care that much.  If we have to scrape by for a year and delay FIRE, and then get a different job down the line that pays lower and delay FIRE a bit more, I'm suddenly much more open to that than I would have been a year ago.


It has been an interesting journey for me both logically and emotionally, and although I imagine that many people would throw FIRE to the wayside because it isn't integrally important to the problem, for me it feels just as critical as ever.  I don't think I'm at the end of this thinking process, but wanted to share some lessons that I feel I've learned and see what thoughts or experiences others might have.


* 1 - Knowing *why* you want to FIRE (and *if* you genuinely want to RE) might not matter when you're starting out, but when problems hit, suddenly it really does.  For me, one of the main reasons to FIRE is to look after my child(ren).  Admittedly, I'd envisaged cheering them on at soccer practice rather than staring at a bunch of medical equipment at 3am in the morning, but that doesn't matter.

* 2 - FIRE is not a rod for your back.  Yes, MMM might shout at you because you ordered a takeaway pizza, but he isn't going to be standing at the pearly gates with some accounting software before condemning you to a pit of angry bear markets.  It is simply an extension of trading time for money.  When life kicks you in the balls, it's OK to buy some ointment.  In this case, my high SR allows me to take a temporary salary drop that might mean skipping mortgage payments for other people.  Or to consider throwing more money at daycare once COVID gets bored and leaves us alone.

* 3 - Even if FIRE can give you enough money to cope with every black swan you've envisaged, there are some things money can't buy.  If I'd tried to work through this, I would genuinely have lost my mind.  And I probably would have compromised my daughter's health, my partner's health, and our marriage.  If I'd refused to pay for a halfway decent hotel near the hospital I wouldn't have been to help my partner through the hardest days.  So if VTSAX has to wait, wait it must.

* 4 - Luck is important, but you can push the odds in your favour.  I can't deny that my employer has been great, but I joined them because I knew we were going to have an family, and my old employer treated anything outside of work as a major drag.  I switched company for no pay rise because I knew the new place were far better - and so it has proved to be.  The old place would not have paid me, and certainly would have invited me to resign by now.  Family and friends have been amazing, but as my therapist pointed out I've bent over backwards for them in the past.  Our neighbours have been wonderful, but partly because we moved to a different part of town with lots of families and young children so that we'd fit in better.  All my daughter's care (I dread to think what the dollar cost might have been) has been fully paid by the state, but equally I chose not to go abroad for big salaries and low taxes where that wouldn't have been guaranteed.  So we've benefited from these things, but not by total chance.


I'm in no doubt that the next few years are going to be rough.  I might go back to my job and get a promotion.  I might coast.  I might quit and do something else.  My partner might quit.  We might spend a lot of money on daycare.  We might need to move to a different area.  Am I comfortable with how my FIRE plans have been altered?  No, honestly I'm not.  I want more than ever to know that I'll never spend another week working in the middle of nowhere on some pointless project, or sat with my laptop in the sun on a Saturday afternoon writing a report no-one will read.  And I have probably pushed that date back to a degree.  But at the same time I'm having to appreciate that the journey is just as important as the destination.  Hopefully in a year or so things will be much clearer, but I'm not quite there yet.",financialindependence

Every Sunday I’m reminded the freedom FI and potentially RE would give me. It’s a weekly shove to trust the process and stay on the course. 

I’d imagine my Sundays would eventually feel like Friday nights, where I can know I control the week ahead.

But I am unsure if I am able to make the argument on behalf of (most of us) to follow this living-within-means, invest, and retire ""well"" argument. Im sure my knowledge is flawed here, but I can't figure out what Im missing in defending FIR (exclude E)

I live in Miami. We have lots of ""50 K millionaires"". In the sense people in Miami believe in putting every ounce they have into cars, clothes, accessories, electronics, and houses (where almost all of these are depreciating assets), even if they can barely afford the monthly payment.

When it comes to your average FIRE, saving and investing is a big deal. The catch I see is, you live your prime years (20-50) saving, only to live your ""so called golden years"" paying for healthcare, your housing, and probably your nursing home.

**Argument:**

My spend-it-all neighbors argue that, ""if youre making 50,60,70 grand/annually (2x)- blow it on the luxuries now- because life sucks when youre old anyway."" When I make the argument that you wont have anything to rely on when youre older- the counter from them is that medicare/Medicaid social security will find them a nursing home, cover their healthcare, etc costs if they are broke.

**IS this true?**

**And if so, where does the middle class worker who maxed out his 401 K since he graduated college and lived life in moderation win?**

My father was disabled at 55 due to a stroke, and as a guy who lived in moderation, I found that (had he lived longer than just months post stroke)- he would receive 0 government assistance, 0 aid, and pay full price for every ounce of life support he needed (healthcare insurance, nursing homes, etc ).

Meanwhile, girlfriend's mother never worked past 30, has had a foreclosure and a bankruptcy. When she did work she made minimum wage, and some how at 60 she is ""Retired"" and collecting 1300 in social security.

**Is this saving, investing worth it when other people can just use the system in place?**

2015 – 70k income, 24k expenses

2016 – 100k income, 19k expenses

2017 – 140k income, 17.5k expenses

2018 – 145k income – 18k expenses

2019 – 200k income – 40k expenses -> I moved to VVHCOL city here

2020 – 250k income – 40k expenses

Expected 2021 – 250k income – 36k expenses

Most of my compensation is base salary. A small portion is cash bonus. No stocks.

**Financial Anxiety**

You’d think I would feel better/relaxed now, but I don’t. You’ll notice a common theme in this post, and that’s anxiety. I have anxiety over spending money, saving money, investments, you name it.

It’s affected my relationships a lot. At times I have been overly controlling even about my partners financial habits. Pre-covid I was seeing a therapist to help deal with this anxiety, and it has actually helped a lot to improve my personal relationships, because now I can at least recognize and feel/touch the anxiety. Before it was just hidden, unknown emotions that I couldn’t place a trigger on. I never thought of myself as an anxious person until therapy. I am outgoing, well-spoken, have no social anxiety, and don’t get anxious about presentations or speaking engagements. I do get anxious though when I splurge on a single purchase because it feels like I’m slipping into lifestyle inflation and my whole world is falling apart. I do get anxious when my partner purchases a single splurge item because I extrapolate it to the extreme - to them having given up on FIRE, and therefore we are incompatible and should break up because ‘clearly FIRE isn’t important to them’. I do get anxious when my partner didn’t want to implement auto deposits every month, because they preferred every 1-2 months just going and manually doing it. To me that just felt like it was so easy to just let everything slip and fall out of control. But they had a method and it works. At the end of the day, our annual spending is very close and I really have no reason to complain or comment on anything that my partner does money wise.

Sounds crazy when you write it out, and I’ve improved a lot in this regard. Therapy has helped. My partner bought a $300 splurge item recently and I barely commented on it. My partner doesn’t do automatic deposits to investments every paycheck and it doesn’t bother me at all anymore. Therapy helped me understand that these were not rational reactions and I was actually reacting to the feeling of ‘losing control’ and ‘things just slipping’. I still often feel the financial anxiety, but the difference is that I understand the emotion for what it is – a mental illness. I can control my reactions, even if I sometimes can’t control my feelings. Before I didn’t realize it was anxiety, I thought my viewpoints were totally justified.

Hell, I even bought a PS5 recently for $500 and it didn’t bother me that much! I’m thankful to now understand how annoyed I would be if my partner made a huge deal every time I wanted to buy something like this. We are all adults and as long as our annual spending is reasonably in line with our goals we are fine.

So hitting LeanFIRE hasn’t really done much for me either. It doesn’t feel real at all. I’m still working and slaving away. I keep trying to tell myself that I don’t ‘need’ to work, but it doesn’t feel like that. I’m not sure if this is because I know in RE I won’t follow 4% rule, likely 3%, or if I will started to feel relaxed as I gain more NW. I basically feel the same as when I was 0 NW. It might also because I feel battered and exhausted from work. If anything, I feel more like a battered, nervous wreck than I was when I was at $0 NW. Back then I felt like I had energy, and enthusiasm, and wanted to take on the world of work. Now I just want to quit. **I shouldn't feel anxiety, but I do**. To be frank I'm extremely lucky and privileged, but sometimes it just doesn't matter. Rationally I know I am very lucky and in a fantastic position. Emotionally it doesn't feel like that.

**RE plans**

I plan to work for another 5-6 or so years, but that may vary depending on a few factors. My job right now causes me a lot of anxiety. The hours are not too bad, but the pressure is high, there is often conflict, tensions are very high, and I am judged on the basis of my decision making. If I make poor decisions it affects the whole business, and I am solely responsible for making a lot of decisions. I basically hope to hold on as long as I can. Every year I am adding 130k to my investment portfolio, with an after-tax savings rate of more than 75% (I pay a LOT of taxes), so I understand the value in trying to just keep working a little bit longer. I think my goal RE number is about 1.5M, which by normal projections I would hit by 2025/2026. I also have a partner who is on the same path but a little bit younger and so is a little bit behind me. Having more cushion in my number will help my partner’s situation as well and make them feel more comfortable about RE.

I might not make it 5-6 years. I don’t know. The last 2 years have been really hard. I’m just trying to hold on as long as I can because my income is high relative to my NW. On the flip side, I might work 10 more. Trying to be flexible.

My reasons for wanting to retire are multifold

1. My job affects my mental health a lot. I just feel so much better when I’m on vacation and away from the office and away from the work stress. I’m a much happier person, my partner notices it too and says I’m a much happier person to be around when I’m away from work. This has only gotten worse as I’ve moved up in roles. When I first started my career it wasn’t so bad. Now it even affects my sleep. WFH doesn’t help this either, it actually makes it worse. It’s not the hours, it’s the pressure to succeed and the stress. I actually enjoy my work when it is lower stress periods – although not enough to spend 40 hours a week doing it. I don’t like being forced to do anything. I would consider to voluntarily work 15 hours a week even if it was unpaid, but roles like that don’t really exist for me. I don’t have enough work experience to become an independent consultant just yet, but that might be something I do down the road.
2. I want to see the world and live abroad. When I retire I will definitely move around. Having financial cushion to be flexible there helps. I don’t know for how long, or where, but FIRE gives me maximum flexibility.
3. I have a lot of hobbies and other ways to spend my time. I could sit at home for 3 months straight and not be bored. That’s not how I plan on spending retirement, but I have lots of things I want to do with my free time instead of working.
4. I probably thinking about retiring every single day. I’m actively trying to not do this, after this post and responding to comments, I won’t be coming back to this sub often. I just need to get away and focus on things outside of work to try and be happy in my day to day life.

I want to work longer and not RE yet because

1. I want more cushion because of my financial anxiety
2. I might want to spend more down the road
3. I’d be nervous about my ability to re-enter the workforce if I left and the market doesn’t do well
4. My income to networth ratio leads itself to saying I should push through as long as I can. If I was only making 30k a year with this stress, good chance I’d just quit and/or work part-time on something relaxing.
5. I have a hard time because I feel like I've struck a golden lotto ticket. Billions of people would kill to be in my shoes and I just feel like a big whiny pants sometimes. Why would I quit when I have such a nice income and reasonable hours?

I don’t want kids and neither does my partner.

**Income**

My income has gone up a lot, and I’ve taken a different route than most people who have income jumps like this. I’ve stayed at the exact same company who has treated me well. I’ve worked hard and been promoted fast. I’ve negotiated comp three times, but not that hard. My comp might be 10k less if I hadn’t. I also compare my compensation to people at my level in the company, and I am similarly paid to them. I’ve also spoken to external recruiters, and I’m being paid fairly. I think the notion that you need to change jobs every 3 years to maximize comp isn’t true 100% the time. If you spend the time to negotiate, compare to your peers, and have a company who treats you right financially, there isn’t a need to move around. Every company is different. Some companies you may need to hop around because they will treat you poorly financially if you are there too long. I’ve worked on 3 different teams in the same company. Also, in 2019 I moved to a VVHCOL city, and my income jumped as a result. I knew the \~250k role was coming in 2020, so that’s why the expense increase was worth it. My savings rate went down, but my total savings $ went up, and I won’t retire to VVHCOL city.

I won’t be sharing my industry or my location or any other information.

**Expenses**

I discovered FIRE midway through 2015 and started being more conscious of expenses then. I also had a few extra expenses such as some student debt to pay off in 2015. I was always frugal, but became a lot more focused once I figured out I could retire early. The biggest thing I changed after discovering FIRE was just cooking more.

I didn’t go to school in the US so my education was significantly cheaper. I graduated with only a few thousand dollars of debt. My parents contributed about $8000 to my education, the rest was self-funded. Worked in high school, had internships in college, etc.

Now my expenses are high, but of the 40k total expenses, over 2k of that is my share of the rent. I share a 1-bedroom apartment with my partner. I live in a very expensive city, but I could easily drop my expenses back down to the \~20k level by moving.

**Investments**

I’m roughly 50/50 VTI and VXUS. I believe in global diversification. The US has done very well lately, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will continue to do well in the future. My investment strategy is basically to mimic the ETF VT. If US becomes a larger proportion of the global stock market, so will my portfolio. Basically what I am saying is that I don’t rebalance. I purchase ETFs every paycheck, and my strategy is just to buy to get myself closer to the VT proportion. VT is around 50/50 now, so I almost just alternate every paycheck buying VTI and VXUS. I don’t need to do anything large because as my ETFs move up and down in value, they are automatically moving towards my goal asset allocation, because my goal is a moving target. As well, my post-FIRE plans lead well to holding high amounts of VXUS as I want to have larger exposure to different currencies.

I didn’t change anything during the brief covid recession. Just kept plugging along.

Real estate is too much work for me. I don’t want to be a landlord. I don’t own the home I live in because I want to move often and 5 years isn’t enough for it to be worthwhile.

**Other ideas**

I’ve toyed with just moving abroad now, and quitting my job and accepting a lower paycheck. That might happen if someday I just can’t hold on any longer. It would be hard for me to take a lower paycheck at this time, maybe if I had a larger NW. I love where I live but I also want to see the world and live abroad.

I’ve toyed with finding a different job that is lower stress, but I’m not sure it exists at this compensation range in my profession. I also enjoy that my hours are reasonable at my job. Sometimes I miss the days of 2015 where I made 70k a year and had no real responsibility. I worked slightly more hours back then, but I wasn’t the one who was ultimately responsible, and my work stress was significantly less. But I’d rather work 5 more years at 250k than 15 more at 70k.

I don’t have a networth tracker. Sorry! I have no idea. They’d be guesses.

**Summary**

That’s it. Feel free to AMA. I was a little bit afraid to make this post because I didn't want to just be another ""High income earner reaching FIRE at a young age"" post, but I think the other aspects of my situation hopefully make things more interesting. I definitely recognize rationally that I've had a fortunate upbringing and am lucky to be here.

FIRE can't control your life. Easier said than done, but I know what I need to do. I need to do things to make my daily life happier, stop daydreaming about retirement, and just be happy. I will only have my 30s once.

Also - therapy is amazing. If you tried it before and didn't like it, try it again with a different therapist! Took me 3 or 4 to find one that clicked.",financialindependence

I was one of five children living with my mom who never graduated from high school. She was a waitress, worked in a store, did odd jobs. I was the youngest kid, and I remember being 12 years old when I got my first pair of shoes that were my very own new shoes, not hand me downs. I remember being arrested for shoplifting when I was 10, and how my mom broke down when she found out I had been stealing school supplies. She wanted us all to go to college. Most of us did. When I was in college on a scholarship, she finally graduated from high school by studying for and passing her GED. She got a job at the county as a clerk, which was the first stable job she ever had.

Two years after I got my Ph.D., I had a brand new townhouse built for her. She got to pick out the granite for the countertops and the fixtures for the bathrooms and the wall color.

When I sold that place later, I lost money, but honestly, fuck money when it comes down to it. It was the nicest place she ever lived in.",financialindependence

260,Firecalc observation on taking pension and SS early vs late,,310,jvrwdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jvrwdq/firecalc_observation_on_taking_pension_and_ss/,1605614897.0,"At these advice of some other posters here I have been running scenarios in [firecalc.com](https://firecalc.com). It is really a great tool as it allows you to put in nearly all of your financial data (portfolio balances and composition, when to start retirement and how long, income needed, pensions, SS, future contributions and windfalls, etc.) and figure out historically if your situation would be successful based on all of the starting years for which they have data.

In my situation, my retirement will be funded by a combination of 401k/457b, pensions, SS, and a windfall I expect when selling my house before moving abroad. I am toying with the idea of retiring in 3 1/2 years at age 55 so I wanted to see what income I could generate.

Without boring you with the details I looked at the differences in withholding my pension from age 55 to 63 (thereby increasing it from less than $13k to more than $26k) and withholding SS from age 62 to 70 (thereby increasing it from less than $25k to more than $43k). Much to my surprise holding out those 8 years to nearly double my income resulted in a less successful retirement by every metric that firecalc shows. I ran the scenarios with a starting income of $84k running to age 90 with CPI increases to see how it worked out. The results show the early payouts (55 and 62) vs waiting (63 and 70):

Odds of success: 92.7% vs 85.4%

Average money left at the end: $8.2M vs $7.3M

High money left at end: $19.3M vs $19.2M

Low money left at end: $-1.9M vs $-3.9M

Worst case minimum number of years before being broke: 22 vs 14

I also figured out what the maximum amount of money to spend each year at historical 100% success and the early pensions/SS won there as well at $78k vs $72k.

The only situation where the late payments works out better is if I hit the worst case scenario and exhaust all of my 401k/457b. The worst historical year would put me at 14 years (age 69) so I could still end up with my pension (more than $26k, only slightly inflation adjusted) and SS at $43k (or about $40k if I had to start at age 69). I would also have another pension that would also pay out about $13k (not inflation adjusted) leaving me with about $79k decreasing effective value annually as my pensions won't keep up with inflation. Whereas if I took the more historically effective route of early payout from my pension and SS, and I still crapped out 22 years later at age 77, I would only have less than $25k (SS) + $13k (pension 1) + $13k (pension 2) = less than $51k, also losing value from inflation. It would be a lot tougher to live on that $51k than $79k if the need arose, although like I said there has never been a scenario where the early withdrawal plan didn't succeed in giving me $78k (inflation adjusted).",financialindependence

With that being said, lets start this FIRE journey!

&#x200B;

**Backstory**

I was born in (and live in) the US, and was fortunate to grow up in a home where we lived well within our means. I learned great savings and money management principals from my father, and was able to go to high school and college with scholarship + family money. This allowed me to work part time (I had a number of successful internships, and personal businesses) and put all of my own money towards personal expenses (cars, computers, etc.), travel/luxuries, and most importantly savings. Fast forward to 2019 and I am able to graduate with a well paying job, no debt, and a small pile of cash. Now that I am looking more seriously at the reason I am saving money, I figured I need to have actual goals and processes in place rather than just stowing away what ""feels right."" FIRE seems like a great goal to have, and even if life changes along the way I won't regret being closer to that security.

I will break down my budget later and there may be a line item that a lot of people don't have -- especially given the time value of money. As a Christian I believe in generous giving & tithing so you will see a significant portion of income dedicated to that end. While I must admit that at times I even find myself thinking ""what if for just this month I allocated that elsewhere...."" this is something that is a part of my life and always will be. It comes off the top out of joy.

**Timeline of Net Worth**

Jan 1, 2019: **32k** \- Savings over the years up to my last semester of college

May 1, 2019: **45k** \- A good semester of contract work & graduation gifts

June 1, 2019: **43k** \- A little dip in equities, started working with 80k salary (and opened 401k)

Jan 1, 2020: **78k** \- Enjoying the bull market, retirement matching, and raise to 105k

Today: **129k** \- More saving, saving, saving

&#x200B;

**Allocations**

Brokerage: **51k** \- Equity investments. Keeps me up at night sometimes.

RoboBroker: **17k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

RothIRA: **19k** \- Equity investments same as Brokerage. Higher risk with long timeline & tax benefits.

RoboRoth: **12k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Roth401k: **20k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Emergency: **10k** \- Roboinvesting with super low risk tolerance (2-3 / 10)

&#x200B;

**Monthly** **Budget**

Taxes: **29%** \- ouch

Giving: **12%**  \- see backstory

Rent: **12%** \- expensive location with multiple roommates

Living: **6%** \- food, gas, gym, etc.

Discretionary: **6%** \- hobbies, travel, etc.

Roth401k: **7%** \- company match 4% - I just moved this up to 14% after building my emergency savings and expecting to lose part of my RothIRA eligibility soon.

RothIRA: **6%** \- Always maxed, however I expect to have to reverse after EoY bonuses.

General Savings: **22%** \- minimum 2k/mo, any leftovers from living & discretionary go here.

&#x200B;

**Kindling the Flames**

It is likely that there is an EoY bonus around the corner but I have no clue what sized -- I would conservatively guess 10k and optimistically guess 20k. I am known to be a bad guesser though and am not going to scoff at 5k either. Hopefully I can skirt by without having to reverse any of my RothIRA contribs but I think at least a portion of these will have to get touched. My plan is to dump this straight to savings.

Having now learned about FIRE concepts I decided that I want to start putting my time, energy, and finances towards this goal. I am not going to be a masochist about it, and absolutely want to maintain a quality of life, but I also want to find better ways to utilize my income to support this. The goal for me isn't retirement for retirement sake, but rather to get to a position where I could take passion jobs without worrying about the income, go take time to serve in other communities/countries, dedicate my time and energy to family or other causes, etc.

I think there is plenty of room for growth and improvement in how I am operating things so I am open to any and all feedback, thoughts, speculations. I know I may have to swallow some pride in the name of wiser investment choices. If anything this may serve as a fun story for myself to look back on as it develops.",financialindependence

I wanted to post my first FIRE entry after hitting 100k last week.

Retirement Net Worth: **103K**

* 401K: **56K**
* Roth IRA (FNCMX): **18K**
* Index Fund (SWPPX): **29K**
* I have a savings account/emergency fund but it's under 10K.

My current goal is 200K by end of 2022. I think my current FIRE number is $2M and would love to retire before 50.

2017: Graduated University of Virginia with an Economics degree. Feel free to throw an asterisk on my story because I graduated without student loans since my parents were able to save for my higher education. I also lived at home in NY from 2017-2019 until I moved to the UK.

* Sept 2017: **55K** - Starting Salary. Bonus range 0-10%, N/A first year.
* March 2019: **63K** - Raise
* November 2020: **76K** - Raise

I won't go into my whole life journey, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments. July 2019 I moved from the US to the UK team of my company on a Tier 2 Intra Company Visa. I can't say I completely understand my pay structure, but I had my company keep me on both payrolls so I could contribute to our 401K. I pay Social Security and Medicare, and Income Tax (UK), everything else is exempt and paid (if needed) EOY during tax season which I already used a tax firm for. 

Here is my breakdown of my 83K salary (76K+7K Bonus)

I only was eligible to start contributing to my 401K after 1 year at my company, so that's when I started saving. I learned about FIRE about a 8 months ago. I'm currently just enjoying my time in London for the next 2 years on my visa. I don't expect any further big pay raises beyond yearly inflation adjustments because I'm now at the top of my Client Associate/Data Analyst ladder. Honestly I like the UK so much, I dread the idea of paying into a HSA or 529 plan because its free over here... (crossing my fingers things work out with my UK girlfriend haha)

I also work on a small Belt start up with friends but that's more a money sink!

264,Some tips to young people in this sub from a 26 y/o who has been on the journey for 5 years.,,2149,jupyqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jupyqj/some_tips_to_young_people_in_this_sub_from_a_26/,1605462566.0,"It seems like there are a decent amount of younger people on here (College/High School Age) more and more which is great! As a 26 y/o who has been on the path for 5 years now I wanted to provide some tips for younger people as they begin this journey. I don't have the experience of people who have FIRE'd per se, but I think I can help explain what worked for me. 

1. Learns the basics

Personal finance and investing is an awesome thing to get into because you can dig as deep into it as you want or stay at the surface level. There is a reason why some of the smartest investing minds in the world (Warren Buffett) read for hours on end. The finance world evolves, markets change, and the way people behave with money moves around. With that being said, you need to learn the basics. What are the basics?

“Spend less than you make, invest the difference”

Spend – Create a budget. Fixed expenses and then fun money. 

Make – Get a job that allows you to save a little bit of cash

Invest – Dollar Cost Average, 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage account, withdrawal rates. 

It will be easy to go down a rabbit hole when reading about personal finance to the point where it might even intimidate you. Learn the basics and get started. There are plenty of free online resources that will help you understand best practices like which % of your budget towards certain items and how to invest. You have some time to iron out the details. The worst thing you can do is not start. 

2. Keep it simple: Index Funds

Index funds. Index Funds. Index Funds. 

I don’t know how else to say this but I would recommend you start off with index funds. I know it isn’t what /r/stocks or /r/wallstreetbets is going to tell you but index funds will allow you to get a piece of the pie without the risk of individual stocks. The worst thing that could happen to you is you throw a grand in a stock based on a tip on Reddit and you get wiped out to the point where you don’t even want to invest in the market anymore. 

Hey competitiveduck, that is great but how do I avoid the FOMO of all these tech gains?

Understand that cycles happen. “Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered”. Look into the top 10 companies by market cap for each decade. Companies come and go. I am not anti-stock at all. I recommend that people play around with stocks to avoid FOMO but only once they have enough in index funds to where compound interest takes over. I didn’t buy a single share of stock until I had >100k invested in index funds and even now it is a small % of my larger portfolio.

3. Get the money

Get the money. You have to be selfish in your career at this point when your expenses are fairly low and you don’t have the responsibilities of a family. Change cities, change jobs, change companies. Get money. If you are all about starting a low-level job in a company with the idea that in 30 years you might be the CEO great, but there is only 1 CEO job for a reason. Maximize earnings in your 20s as much as you can, invest, and wait. If you don’t believe me, look up videos or pictures of what happens at 65 based on when you start investing. The difference in net worth is staggering. Get money. 

4. It easiest to compare yourself to others post-college

I’m not sure there will ever be a time in your life where it is easiest to feel bad about yourself than right after college. You go from everybody playing the same game in college to now everybody is in separate leagues and playing a different sport. You have a friend in law school in debt up to their ass, you have a friend crushing it at Google, you have a friend struggling to figure things out and there might be you just hoping to get enough money for guac at Chipotle. Understand that you don’t need to be anywhere else than where YOU think you need to be. Life tends to even itself out. 

“Comparison is the thief of joy”

5. Keep in touch with friends and take care of your body 

To echo on the last point, good friends are hard to come by the older you get. Try and keep in touch with them as much as possible and plan trips to see them. Some of my best friends still are my college friends. Use them as a base but don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and explore new people. 

In regard to staying in shape, there is no sense in retiring early if your body isn’t able to do things you want to do. Plain and simple. 

6. Do what works for you, not what works in a spreadsheet

You are going to hear about all the ways you can tinker with your investments or take on debt and theoretically it works in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets aren’t rooted in reality. Some of these include how it is easier to put less than 20% down on a house because interest rates are so low and invest the difference, or how you should invest 80% of your paycheck to tap into investing. Morgan Housel has a way of investing and I think it is great in that you should invest in a way that “helps you sleep at night” and in a way that you can do it consistently for decades. Do what works for you. 

7. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme

Understand the game that you are playing. Investing Twitter and TV networks react to daily moves in the market. You aren’t in it for the short term, you are in it for the long term. If you are in your early 20’s you probably have a 30-40-year time horizon. Think of all the crazy world events that have happened in the last 30-40 years alone. COVID, 08 Financial Crisis, Iraq War, 9/11, Dot Com Crash, and then the 1987 Market Crash. All of those “world is ending” type events have led to a 9.42% average return before inflation. To tap into the power of compound interest you need to stay in the market for a long period of time.

“Interrupting a favorable power law is the worst mistake you can make as an investor.” – Naval

8. Read the top posts on this subreddit but be aware of survivorship bias 

The fact that you are in this subreddit is a great start. Use the resources in the wiki to learn about investment options and what works for other people. Learn about people who have achieved FIRE and how they got there. Most of the time it is a bumpy road with kids, large one-off expenses, buying a house, changing careers, etc. Like the stock market, it is rarely a smooth ride. However, there is a lot of survivorship bias in here about people who have achieved FIRE. For every person who has achieved it, there are probably 10 who have given up, ruined a relationship, or became miserable due to extreme saving. Please understand that this is a grind and if you aren’t happy now with the hopes of being happy 30 years ago, I’d advise you to take a step back and read the below post. It is essential reading.

265,Taking a closer look at investment returns.,,5,jvfjbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jvfjbq/taking_a_closer_look_at_investment_returns/,1605561886.0,"A few months ago, someone on this sub made a post asking why people on FI journeys don’t spend more time discussing their investments. I can’t find it anymore, but I recall that the general consensus was that since we can’t predict how the stock market will perform, there isn’t much to discuss, and those on the FI path would be better served spending that time on things they can control like increasing their income and decreasing spending. While I do agree that the market is out of any one person’s control, I think it *is* prudent to spend a considerable amount of time optimizing our portfolios given that a good chunk of FI/RE is usually achieved by means of investments. 

It seems to me that the argument for a globally diversified portfolio is that there are times when the US outperforms the world and times when the world outperforms the US, and that there are too many unknowns to make an accurate prediction, so it is best to just buy a slice of everything. The underlying assumption is that there is an *equal chance* that any one group of stocks will outperform the rest, which is why we are supposed to buy a global market-weighted ETF like $VT. I think this idea is a bit flawed and unfair to historically well-performing subclasses of stocks.

Hypothetically speaking, let’s say that the NASDAQ-100 ($QQQ) has a 50/50 chance of having a repeat of the last decade (19.04%) or go to zero dollars, with nothing in between, vs. a 100% chance that $VT will repeat its last 10 years in performance (8.06%). Assuming you have the risk tolerance to accommodate both, which would you choose?

A $10,000 in $QQQ in November of 2010 would have yielded $57,137 by the end of October 2020 and $21,713 for $VT. $QQQ returned over **4x** as much in nominal dollar returns. So, the expected value of our hypothetical is:

$QQQ: (0.5* $47,137 + 0.5* -$10,000) = $18,569.

$VT: (1.0 * $11,713) = $11,713. 

As you can see, the expected value of $QQQ is STILL vastly higher even when considering a 50% chance of the NASDAQ-100 going to zero in ten years time. Not just 0% returns, but actually declining all the way down to zero. In fact, in this two outcome experiment, you would only need a 38% chance of a repeat on the $QQQ and a **62%** chance of going to zero to trump a *guaranteed* 8.06% return on $VT from a purely mathematical perspective.

This wouldn’t be an issue if all indexes both in the US and around the world returned roughly the same amount, but they don’t, there is a large gap between well-performing American indexes like the NASDAQ-100 and the global average that only seems to be getting bigger as larger returns compound over time. 

There is a large opportunity cost that comes with safety in being well-diversified that many I feel are not fully taking into consideration. Yes, past results doesn’t guarantee future returns, yes, you can’t predict the stock market, but does that mean that I should simply default to a globally diversified portfolio? In my opinion, if your risk tolerance can accommodate both, it makes sense to take a calculated risk because the reward could be so great. 

In a more realistic example, suppose that I think there is a 25% chance that the NASDAQ returns 4% in the next 10 years (less than a quarter what is was in the decade prior), 50% chance of a 10% return and a 25% chance of a 15% return, again, well below the last 10 years. I would consider this to be a pessimistic outlook. Compare that to a 25% chance of $VT repeating 8% and a 75% chance of outperforming the last decade, a 10% return. 

$QQQ:  (0.25 * $4,802 + 0.5 * $15,937 + 0.25 + $30,456) = $16,783
$VT: (0.25 * $11,589 + 0.75 * $15,937) = $14,850


It’s still not even close. My point is that the NASDAQ-100 would have to fall *really* far to justify holding a globally-diversified ETF, and even a small chance of a repeat is enough to warrant taking that risk. I think it is important to do these calculations for your own portfolio rather than simply shutting off our brains and assuming that all outcomes have the same probability in light of past performance. Again, this *only* applies when your risk tolerance is not a factor.

267,At the request of a couple commenters.. Opportunity Zones explained,,36,jv1cz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jv1cz3/at_the_request_of_a_couple_commenters_opportunity/,1605504722.0,"Two posters asked that I explain opportunity zones today and said I should post on it, so here goes... TL/DR investing in opportunity zones defers and offsets capital gains taxes

&#x200B;

**What is the** **Opportunity** **Zone** **Program?**  


As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), Congress created the Qualified Opportunity Zones (""QOZ"") program to encourage development in economically distressed communities across the country designated as Opportunity Zones by the various state and federal authorities.    
**What is an** **Opportunity** **Zone?**  
Opportunity Zones are census tracts designated by state and federal governments targeted for economic development.

**How Does the Program Work?**To encourage private investment, the Treasury, acting through the IRS, provides potentially massive tax benefits for investors who invest in Opportunity Zones through a Qualified Opportunity Fund (""Opportunity Fund"").    


A Qualified Opportunity Fund is a private partnership or corporation organized for the purpose of investing in a Qualified Opportunity Zone business or real estate development.    
**What are the Tax Benefits?**  
The biggest draw offered to investors is the chance to defer taxes on recent or potential capital gains from appreciated assets such as real estate or stocks until December 31, 2026.  
By investing in an Opportunity Fund, an investor can:  


* Defer taxes on the original capital gain until the end of 2026.
* Reduce up to 15% of the tax bill on the original capital gains if remain invested in the Fund for at least 7 years.
* Completely eliminate the tax on any appreciation (new capital gains) on the original investment after the 10-year mark in the Opportunity Fund.

The QOZ program is designed to encourage long-term investments.  The longer an investor leaves their capital gains in an Opportunity Fund, the greater the tax savings.  
Here is a summary of the long-term benefits:

The Qualified Opportunity Zones program is a tremendous [opportunity sitting on capital gains to re-invest those gains in an Opportunity Fund to reap massive tax benefits and potential profits.    


At the same time, they would be helping economic development in the neediest neighborhoods across the country by developing businesses and real estate in those communities and, in turn, providing valuable jobs for eager residents. It's a true win-win for everyone involved.",financialindependence

270,Savings Rate as a Function of Wealth to Reach FIRE,,333,jufo6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jufo6u/savings_rate_as_a_function_of_wealth_to_reach_fire/,1605412939.0," 

I found this fascinating. I'll keep this short but I thought this group might appreciate it as well.

I  was doing some light reading on wealth inequality over time and found  this gem. There was a presentation on wealth inequality that predicted  total wealth based on reported income and estimate returns for each  asset class. The thing that stood out to me was that wealthy individual  were not getting any higher return on investments than the rest of the  country and there was an interesting chart on Savings Rate (SR) for each  wealth percentile. They related Savings Rate to Wealth accumulation over time. I think this is directly related to living off of investment income and achieving financial independence.

&#x200B;

Between 1913 and 2013:

* The bottom 90% maximum SR was \~7% in the 1940's and 1980's
* The top 10-1% maximum SR was 35% before 1920
* The top 1% maximum SR was 50% in the 1980's

As the title states....

&#x200B;

I've been a long time lurker and just crunched the numbers tonight and wanted to share. I am so happy. I did it. Brings tears to my eyes.

&#x200B;

I'm 32, African American and a single mom of 1 teenager. I was born and raised in a true ""hood"", long ago, before gentrification came along. My parents were a part of the 80s crack epidemic that wiped out many families, especially African American families. I ended up in foster care and remained there my entire childhood until being emancipated and left to fend for myself in the streets of NYC at 15 years old in the early 2000s. I was a homeless and pregnant teen and immediately became a single mom.

&#x200B;

Through this turmoil and the crippling depression and feeling of hopelessness that came along with the ""humble beginnings"" of my life, I was able to graduate school early, find a job, saved just enough money to go to a trade school (it was $700 back then and every single dime that I had.) Through HARD work and insane grit and perseverance, I obtained all of my certifications and began my career at age 19. I've never looked back.

&#x200B;

I discovered the FIRE and personal finance community nearly 3 years ago and its been a God send. I am rewriting my families wealth tree and I couldn't be prouder.

&#x200B;

I am navigating the world solo (no biological family besides my son) yet I've found the will to succeed, despite all of the trials, tribulations and abandonments.

&#x200B;

At 12:15am on 7/16/19, 32 years of age, 13 years into my career, 1 teen son, and a LOT OF PRAYERS along the way....later.. my NET WORTH is $103,408!

&#x200B;

A MIXTURE of 457, 457 Roth, 401K, 529, smaller investment portfolio and pension.

I will be retiring at age 45 with a full pension and God willing a MILLION DOLLAR portfolio.

&#x200B;

This is the most I'm willing to share. Please don't nit-pick, pry more or be passive aggressive.  Just wanted to inspire someone somewhere who may not have as many or ANY resources to succeed.

&#x200B;

Long Story Short: No one thought I'd make it out from under the shitty hand I was dealt. I did and just surpassed a $100K Net Worth!

&#x200B;

EDIT #1: Some of you are super triggered. LOL. I don't see this type of responses on other more ""traditional"" postings. Y'all do know I have thick skin and come from a place where nightmares are made of...right?! I also have worked in a very AGGRESSIVE fast pace career interacting with strangers during their absolute worst moments for 13 yrs +.... read: they are with the shxts and so am I.... LOL....you do know your typed ""insults"" don't hurt...right?!

&#x200B;

EDIT #2: If I did not a THING else I would STILL be retiring with a FULL PENSION of nearly 50K + health insurance. Yes, at age 45. 25 years of service and that's it. Not 25 years of service + age requirement. 

&#x200B;

EDIT #3: Yes, a 1 million dollar portfolio is lofty for some and not lofty for others. For me, it's just an idealistic number...really... 

&#x200B;

EDIT #4: 20-30K + investments I'll continue to have yearly for the next 14 years. I am currently at 26K invested this year and we are only in July. I am nearly 3 years in to saving this aggressively at 50%+ (had it at nearly 70% for months and just lowered my percentages. It's not a race.)

&#x200B;

EDIT #4: I am a Paramedic. I also clean apartments as a side gig. My current career has no overtime cap. I have coworkers making 100% OVER their salary. 


EDIT #5: I live on 30K in NYC (by choice: frugal minimalist). I invest ALL OF THE REST. I do NOT have to invest this aggressively. God covered me and I made a great choice in trade/career and the medical field knows no recession especially in NYC. I am BLACK AND PROUD of what I am doing, no plans to stop. Thank you for ALL the comments. Positive, neutral and negative. I learned a long time ago that SUCCESS can't be denied. I will surely be back with updates.

I was wondering if I was insane. I realized, after reading all the comments, that I was a little insane/stupid for wanting to do that. That day, I deleted the Word doc file which contained my resignation letter, and decided to update my resume to look for a new job instead.

The following Monday (the day I originally planned to quit) I got in touch with a prominent employment agency in the area and had a 20 minute talk with a recruiter that afternoon. Within that week, the recruiter got me set up with 3 interviews for various finance jobs in my city. One was part-time and the other 2 were full-time roles that I found interesting because they weren't traditional finance jobs...they were quasi finance/IT roles. 

Out of those 3 interviews, I got 2 offers last week - an offer for the part-time job and an offer for one of the full-time positions. I accepted the full-time position. I chose it because it comes with WAY better benefits than my current job, more flexibility in the hours, less over time, work from home 2 days a week, and I also got a salary bump from $85k to $98k. 

I'm going to give my 2 weeks notice tomorrow...good riddance. I can't wait to leave this job. I now feel a renewed yearning to work. I'd had it up to HERE with the traditional office environment in my current job and all the crap that comes with working in an office. I realize that's the real reason I wanted to abandon working. I think this job change will make working more enjoyable and I won't be miserable. I'll at least have that pink cloud experience that comes with starting a new job. With my current job, it got to the point where I would start every work day with thoughts like: I don't wanna be here today, this sucks, these cubicles are starting to look more like prison cells, etc. 

So that's my update. I don't know if I'll truly be happier with this new gig, but I'll give it a year and who knows...maybe I'll be one of those people that love my job. Maybe I'll still hate working and I'll consider quitting again a year from now. Who knows. I'm pretty optimistic, though. I'd really like to grow my stash to around the $1 million mark in order to RE comfortably without forcing myself to make lattes part-time, for peanuts, just to get health coverage. 

Bonus win for me: I selected a start date further out so that I'll have enough time to finish out my 2 weeks, decompress for 1 week, travel for a few weeks (where? not sure yet), then decompress for 2 more weeks before I start working again.",financialindependence

EDIT: Some more details, he has a family (4) and probably spends $50,000/year on expenses. He seems to think that his lifestyle would elevate indefinitely and he could stop working if he had $1M.

First I’d like to say that I’m incredibly grateful to have found such an inspiring and supportive community with the shared goal to reach FI. You all are badass!

**My Story**

I was born and raised in a poverty-stricken neighborhood until I was 18 y/o. I’m talking drive-bys, drug addicts every other block, high school dropouts, family fights (physical), and tons of teenage pregnancies. I still wonder how I managed to slip through the cracks. My mother was and still is a low key alcoholic and never showed much affection or interest in me. My father was a workaholic, but always encouraged me to do better and find a productive way to escape our grim reality.

It wasn’t until sophomore year of high school when I started taking education seriously (aka my “Shit, I gotta get the f\*ck outta here” wake up call). I eventually made honor roll (repeatedly) and was accepted into an after school program that helped underprivileged students study for SATs and apply to scholarships/colleges. I am forever indebted to the selfless staff members who guided me in the right direction.

After applying to some colleges and writing several scholarship essays, I finally received a full ride scholarship to my dream university. I absolutely couldn’t believe it. I had a good ugly cry that day (snot in mouth, hyperventilating, the works). That was also the first time I can recall my mother (and other relatives) showing interest in me, but I knew better. At this point, I was ready to peace.

During my freshmen year of college, I met my boyfriend (9 yrs together) who’s literally my favorite person in the world. He has calmly listened to the traumatizing stories of my youth, comforted me during bouts of sadness, and has helped me let go of the past (but not necessarily forget) and move on with my life. We now live together (HCOL area) with our cat, are both debt free, and have no interest in having children. His NW is about double mine. In our free time we play video games, go hiking, and travel. We also have a shared desire to purchase a house outright later in life (no rush with this. still figuring out which state to settle down) and retire early.

Since graduating university I’ve been working in a non-tech job, earning a little under six figures, and saving about 60% of my income. I keep to myself and couldn’t care less about materialistic things (clothes, makeup, apt decor), which is interesting given the environment I grew up in (poor people trying to appear wealthy). I’ve cut off many toxic family members and friends who’ve been incredibly negative and self destructive. Distancing myself from them has improved my mental state tenfold.

I discovered FI at 24 y/o and have been laser focused on rewriting my family history. Every now and then I wake up thinking it’s all a dream and then when I realize this is really my life now I become so emotionally overwhelmed that I need to take deep breaths to manage it all.

Now that I find myself surrounded by people who have had healthy upbringings, I sometimes find it difficult to relate/connect with them. Especially when they ask about my past. But I’m learning to open up more. I guess I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me.

There you have it. After 3 yrs of actively saving/investing, my NW is $121,420 spread across 401k, IRA, brokerage, and cash.

My ultimate goal is to become a multi-millionaire and have the option to retire early in my 40s with my partner.

I hope this inspires someone who may not have the support system or resources to overcome adversity. Stay focused. I’m rooting for you.

As a FIREer, what is going for us is that majority of us who are more than half way there own large assets in stock market. I think a lot of us belong to the top 10%.

As the world plunges into chaos and unemployment is at sky high, a lot of us FIREers are making seriously good money in the stock market. If you re heavy on NASDQ index or FANNG stocks, you are killing it.

Does it ever cause a bit guilt in you that you are fairing so much better than the 90% population? That you don't even need to work and your portfolio is pulling in more money than average household income?

I do. I feel guilty. I work in asset management and I feel the whole stock market is so rigged that it's a way for the rich to enrich themselves. One of my mentors once told me that if you want to be rich, you own assets and businesses and hire others to do the work for you. One day, you will be making money while you are sleeping. I've dreamed to get there one day like him. And I did. But I have tremendous amount of guilt that I don't do shit and I make 6 figures a year just by sitting on FANNG and other Tech stocks.

281,"Why I downvote your ""alternative"" investment advice",,6710,bpdxy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bpdxy3/why_i_downvote_your_alternative_investment_advice/,1558020462.0,"Lately I've noticed a bit of a trend around here of people who are particularly bitter that index fund investing seems to be the standard, go-to investment advice, and their personal favorite type of investment doesn't get the attention they want it to. 

Often times these comments get phrased in sort of a self fulfilling way like

> The VTSAX cult around here will just bury any investment advice that doesn't toe the party line.

Which makes them difficult to respond to in a constructive way in the moment. So I thought I'd write up some thoughts on the matter outside of that framing.

Here's a list of all the ""alternative"" investment advice I see around here with an explanation for why I pretty much downvote them on site every time:

1. **Crypto** - Crypto is a speculative commodity, not a value generating asset. The fact that you, or someone you know, got lucky and made a bunch of money off of it doesn't change that. [edit] The fact that the underlying technology has potential value generating applications *outside* of cryptocurrencies doesn't change that. You're not investing. You're gambling. Crypto has no place in a serious long term portfolio beyond some trivially small amount you keep on the side to play around with for fun (the same goes for any other speculative commodity as well). 

2. **Individual stocks** - Yes, Warren Buffet can pick stocks. *You* can't. This isn't even an argument. The research on the topic is overwhelming. The average return for individual investors who pick their own stocks is something like 1-2%. The fact that you managed to outperform the market for a year or two isn't evidence to the contrary, it's [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

3. **Managed funds** - This one gets more complicated. Yes, there are good fund managers out there who can outperform the market. But for you, the individual investor, the challenge is not in knowing that these people exist. The challenge is in being able to identify them from a) bad fund managers who match or underperform the market (the easy one), b) *bad* fund managers who *outperform* the market just due to luck, and c) good fund managers who outperform the market, but charge so much in fees that it doesn't matter. This is not necessarily an impossible task. But anyone who's done enough of their research to be able to successfully do that, is someone who knows enough that they don't need investment advice from random anonymous strangers on the internet. So it's still bad investment advice to go around doling out to random anonymous strangers on the internet.  

4. **Entrepreneurship** - This seems to be the topic du jour for some reason. And though I've already mentioned it, I have to once again stress the topic of survivorship bias. *80%* of small businesses fail within the first year. The fact that *you* were successful does not mean someone else will be. Not only that, but your success is not repeatable. Someone can go out and do *exactly* the same thing you did and lose everything they had. Entrepreneurship is at the very upper end of the risk/reward scale. Furthermore, running a business is most definitely not for everyone. It takes a very specific kind of person working in exactly the right field for them. Running around telling people, who've given no hint of any inclination to start a business, that the really ought to consider doing so just because it will lead to riches beyond their dreams is just bad advice. 

5. **Rental properties** - I hesitate to include this one, because compared to the rest of this list, it's actually not a bad investment strategy. However, there is a specific, and very common, type of person who likes to pump rental properties that I will pretty much always downvote. And that's the type of person who likes to claim how much better their rental returns are relative to market returns while simultaneously glossing over things like the fact that they're: comparing leveraged returns to non-leveraged returns, not counting expenses like property taxes or maintenance, not counting risk factors like vacancy months, not counting the amount of sweat equity they put into their properties, or any combination of the above. Even taking all that into account, you like still have some small ROR premium, but it's often offset by the fact that your investment isn't liquid and isn't very diversified. Again, *not a bad investment choice* for a lot of people. But if you're one of the people who go around talking about how it's so much clearly better than equities and anyone who puts money into the market instead of rentals is an idiot, you're gonna get a downvote.

Edit: Just to clarify, I don't think the last two in particular are bad investments for a specific group of people. I do think they're often bad investment *advice* though. Particularly if you go around pumping them to people who've shown no interest whatsoever in those areas or random people you know next to nothing about. If you're responding to someone who's specifically showing interest in starting their own business or buying rentals, and if you're being honest about both the pros and cons of that investment, I have no problem.",financialindependence

You will be set for retirement after 10 years of hard work! I would at least continue to contribute enough money to get the employer match for 401k and Roth is tax-free investing. It would be a good idea to continue to work until you're 65 when you're eligible for Medicaid because paying for Healthcare yourself is extremely costly. 

It helps to stay over your folks' place for a while. Staying over their place may not be pleasant, but it beats working at Home Depot when you're old and you're forced to stay late without OT because your supervisor wanted to do your performance evaluations.

We never evolved to sit in a cubicle running from meeting to meeting 8 hours or more a day, spending the evenings thiking about things we need to do the next day, getting less than needed sleep.

Even though we are much more well off now than earlier decades, studies show we are getting more and more stressed. 

Even though I mostly enjoy my job, I still feel much more relaxed in the weekends / vacations. 

I wonder what kind of lifestyle would be more natural, living closer to what we evolved in. Perhaps a smaller house close to or in nature instead of a big house in the suburbs; staying offline most of the time limiting information overload, having friends and family over and doing things outside, mostly pratcial stuff instead of browsing the internet and watching TV all the time etc.

Have you ever thought that we might not have evolved to live like we do? Has this affected your path to FIRE? This is what motivates my FIRE journey, having the choice to live differently.

Throwaway because numbers.

I've been on this FIRE journey since I was 18. I've done pretty well for myself so far and am on track to retire by 40. But, I royally fucked up this week. This is just a reminder to everyone who can hopefully learn from my mistakes: never, ever let people find out how much money you have. Hide it at all costs & don't trust anyone. Also, I need advice.

My mom was in town the other day and, while I was at work, I let her chill at my apartment before an appointment she had. That morning, I was working on some papers for a visa application. For the application, I have to account for my current income and assets ($115k/yr, $525k) and also include copies of my account statements. Those papers were on my desk in my bedroom in plain sight.

I didn't think about it until she called me yesterday and flat out told me that she saw the papers on my desk. Then, she started crying and told me in very clear terms that she expected help. She then laid out (in detail) all the financial problems that she and the rest of my family were having. I honestly didn't know what to do or say so I just hung up.

Yes, because I am socially inept and can't handle confrontation like that, I hung up... and ignored the next 4 calls and 5 texts she sent. I also ignored the calls from my siblings and aunt. So I am thinking that she talked to the rest of my family about this and told them that I am now ignoring her. $525k is basically an unlimited amount of money from her perspective and my family thought that I was just as poor as they are so, I get it? I understand how much of a shock that would have been for her. But, I wish I wasn't so careless. I had no idea she would go snooping in my bedroom.

I don't know what to do now. I don't plan on ignoring my family forever and I can't talk to any of my friends about this so.... what would you do? OR if anyone here has actually dealt with a situation like this, advice on a way forward is greatly appreciated.

I got really into personal finance and FIRE over the past say 2 years, mostly by reading Reddit and Investopedia. After reading so much about personal finance and investing online, I figured it was time to read some of the classic personal finance books. I started with Rich Dad Poor Dad because I hear it tossed around so much.

Now, I will start off with the positives about the book. I think from a mindset perspective, it's really actually quite good. Things that I think people should take more seriously are paying yourself first, knowing how to buy assets, having your money make money, optimizing assets, etc. All of this is great advice and certainly not enough people heed it.

My main frustrations from the book came from the specific examples that Robert Kiyosaki chose to give. Just to name some off the top of my head, here are a few things that he suggests over the course of the book:

* Dropping money in penny stocks and IPOs to make a killing (he cites one example of making an absurd amount of money off one... seems like selective hindsight to me)
* Picking up foreclosed houses to flip. Sure I bet you can make money this way, but certainly not great advice for the regular person
* Everyone should join a multi-level marketing company to learn how to sell. This one made me laugh... that is awful advice
* Investing in 16% tax liens. This one he even brings up an example of his friend calling him dumb and he is so smug about it when defending himself.

Those four were particularly bad, but I remember several others that made me scratch my head. I mean, the man acts like investing in a mutual fund is for someone who wants to live on rice and beans the rest of their life (to be fair though, I know low-cost index funds weren't as widely available / know about back when the book was written).

To add to the bad advice, it also annoyed me from a stylistic perspective that he acts like poor people are all as dumb as rocks and his cunning genius is why he's rich. I can only imagine the people who read his book and went out and joined an MLM and put all their money into tax liens and wonder why they never got rich.

My Background Info

Grew up in suburbia outside of a LCOL city in the Northeast USA. Still live in the same general area. Most of my family is dead or I'm not in contact with them (not trying to be a sob story here), and have had no inheritances or insurance payouts. I went to college for about 2 years but absolutely hated it - I was never more depressed in my life than in my last year of high school and into college. I never knew what I wanted to do and majored in something I was good at (Math) but... ugh, I just hate talking about it. I hated school so much, and wish I put a lot more thought into things when I was younger, but I didn't have any direction and went to college just because it was what everyone else was doing and was expected of me. Looking back, I wish I had gone with a trade or at least community college first, but oh well. I had some scholarships but the majority of my college was paid for via loans, which I still had to pay off with no degree to show for it. I finished paying these off completely about 2 years ago.

I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. If you're in the same boat, I really hope this speaks to you, because being financially independent and retiring early is still in your grasp if you put your mind to it. I have a lot of hobbies but I feel like I've never found my passion, and I'm still looking.

Net Worth

Assets:

* $56k condo. I bought this almost 3 years ago. I have HOA fees but that combined with utilities and my mortgage payment, I'm paying a hair under $800/month (and I live alone!). I got a really good deal at the time - most of the units in this condominium were going for $60-65k and housing has gone up, so if and when I sell I will probably make more, but for the purposes of this thread I'm lowballing and just using what I paid for it originally. Living in a LCOL of living area has been huge for me.

* $55.5k in retirement accounts. This is the big one. I started investing in my company's 401k as soon as I got to my current job 5 years ago, even though I didn't fully know what I was getting into. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. $49k in 401k and $5.7k in a Roth IRA that I started this year. If you're going to stop here my biggest piece of financial advice is INVEST EARLY. Invest as early as possible. Yes, we're probably going to see market corrections soon because it's been insane lately, but if you're super worried about it I advise you to read [this](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/27/the-inspiring-story-of-the-worst-market-timer-ever.html).

* $20k in bank. I have about $13k in my saving account at the local credit union, and $7k in a checking account. This one I'm still working on - it's hard for me to not have money in my account because I'm just a worrisome Wally. In January, I am going to dump another $5.5k from this into my IRA and then figure out what to do with the rest. 

* $7.5k car, fully paid off. The range on KBB is $7,780-$8,973 for my car in good condition. Again, lowballing because I take good care of it but I'm rounding down for everything in the asset category.
 
Total is $139k.

Liabilities:

* $32.1k left on my mortage payments. This is very slightly rounded up. I've been aggressive paying this off, simply because I'm a debt averse person. Most people on this sub would recommend NOT paying this off as aggressively as I have because I'd get better returns investing, but I'm okay with this and it's given me peace of mind.

* And that's it. I mentioned I paid off my student loans, and I always pay off my credit cards in full because I only buy things I can already afford. Not having (a lot of) debt is GREAT, and something I highly recommend.

Assets - Liability = Net Worth:

$139k - $32.1k = $106.9k

I was working dead end jobs during and after college just kind of putzing around for a few years. My last two jobs I was making $8.25/hr and $8/hr. A friend of mine invited me to a job fair and I said what the hell. It wasn't a job fair, it was a headhunter/temp agency that got our information. My friend and I hit it off with the lady, and she recommended a really good company to work for and again, I said what the hell. It was a factory job and I was making $12/hour, which was awesome to me at the time. I worked in the factory for about 2 years when a position opened up in the office at the same company. I applied because again, what the hell, and got the position mostly due to my experience and interpersonal skills. It's a really boring, primarily data entry position, but with raises and such I'm up to just over $17/hour, with a monthly bonus of anywhere from 5%-20% (it's usually around 16% or so). So about $20/hour. With overtime, I've been coming in around or just under $45k/year (pre-taxes... my state income taxes are prettay prettay prettay high), and will probably be around there again this year. 

It is NOT glamorous. I kind of glossed over it, but I've busted my ass to get here over the past 5 years. I started working a hard labor job that I fell into, and lucked into a position opening up, but I got both positions and rose to where I am because of my skills, attitude, and by working hard. I do not like my job at all, but it's far and away the best job I've ever had. I have health insurance. I have a 401k, and they match up to 6% of what I put in (currently putting in 20% of my paycheck, may go higher next year). It can be high stress when I get busy but I often times find myself spending half the day on reddit, and I read a lot on the job. I have to stretch every morning and evening because I get sciatic nerve pain from sitting all day.

I don't plan on going back to school, probably never will. I don't know what I want to do with my life. But I'm really enjoying it. I don't let my job define me. I have hobbies and friends I really enjoy. I date, and I've been getting into travelling a lot more. I took two road trips this year, and next year I hope to go overseas for the first time in my life. 

I've always been a naturally frugal person, so I plan to lean FIRE. I don't have an end goal number - I just know I want to retire as soon as possible so I can spend more time on myself. I want to explore more hobbies. I want to see what the world has to offer me. I do eventually want to find something I'm truly passionate about, but at this point I don't think I'll be too upset if that never comes.

My thoughts are kind of all over the place. I'm writing this while watching Night of the Creeps because it's October, and I'm not a great writer to begin with. If you take anything away from my post, take away these 3 things:

1) Enjoy and live your life. Your happiness, no matter what triggers it, is paramount. 

2) Your path to financial independence doesn't have to be like anyone else's. Use the insane amount of resources available to you on this sub and online, but don't get discouraged if your decisions and what's available to you is different.

3) Fuck work.

EDIT: I'm signing off this throwaway, appreciated reading and responding to you guys in here. I hope this reaches people that need it - I never would have believed I'd be in this position even just two years ago. It gets better, keep working at it. I love this sub and am so I glad I found it, not just for the advice and good conversation but because it's so nice to be understood by like-minded people. 

EDIT2: Well it's safe to say this got a tad more exposure than I thought it would (2nd highest upvoted thread on this sub all time... holy moly). I decided to log back into the throwaway and will be commenting on a few more posts. Most notably, a lot of people seemed to be interested in my condo and especially the price, so I made a [standalone post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/744o7e/28m_single_cross_100k_net_worth_this_year_no/dnx0i0i/).

I just want to thank everyone for reading, it was fun to share my story and read through all the posts today at work. I kind of forgot about the topic and then checked the sub at work on my break like I usually do and was blown away. I'm especially tickled pink about the posts people have made about being in the same or similar situation, past, present, and future. It's always so nice for me to find people that I can relate with, and when I saw all the posts about people just starting out at a similar salary and talking about how my post gave them motivation, it warmed the cockles of my heart. Apparently I also have a few long lost twins out there. ",financialindependence

Things I mercilessly cut spending on: clothes, restaurants/bars, furniture, cars, and new tech/devices. These things don’t really affect my happiness.

me, and that’s great! My point is just to make it clear what you care about, and allow yourself to direct money that way. Even though I spend on things I love, my monthly spending has taken a nosedive by saving on things I don’t care about.

Edit: Wow thank you for the love and awards on my first-ever Reddit post. As many of you pointed out, the quote is from Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich. I also wanted to clarify that “extravagant” doesn’t necessarily mean “luxury.” When I say I spend extravagantly on things, I still do so responsibly.

Throughout the years, I've paid off debt aggressively, starting with the highest % loan first, and made a game of it. I seriously got a thrill out of figuring out how I could either increase my income, or reduce my expenses to put more money against debt each month. 

Just last year, I knocked out my mortgage at age 33. That kicked my savings/investing into high gear, essentially giving me that much more to invest each month.

Today, when I ran my summary, my total net worth crossed just over the $1MM mark. I have to say, I sure as heck don't feel like a millionaire. I still live somewhat frugally, but thats the life long habit that got me here.

As if all of that wasn’t obnoxious enough, now simple texts that shouldn’t involve $$ now do. Example: We’re going on a road trip soon and instead of asking if I’d be willing to drive, she sends this: “Any chance we could take your car but I drive?  I get so car sick if i don’t.

301,Timing the market: The absolute worst vs absolute best vs slow and steady,,4200,c02ml4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/,1560409612.0,"I downloaded the historic S&P 500 data going back 40 years. I dumped everything in Google Sheets and modeled the three different portfolios, named after three fictional friends Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah. All three saved $200 of their income per month for 40 years for a total of $96,000 each. But after 40 years they all ended up with different amounts based on their investment strategies.

###Tiffany's Terrible Timing

Tiffany is the world's worst market timing. She saves $200/month in a savings account getting 3% interest until the worst possible times. She started by saving for 8 years only to put her money in at the absolute market peak in 1987, right before Black Monday and the resulting 33% crash. But she never sold, and instead started saving her cash again, only to do the same at the next three market peaks. Each time she invested the full amount of her saved cash only to watch the market crash immediately after. Most recently she put all her money in the day before the 2007 financial crisis. She’s been saving cash ever since waiting for the next market peak.

With this perfectly bad market timing, Tiffany still didn’t do too bad. Her $96,000 she saved and invested over the last 40 years is now worth **$663,594**. Even though she invested only at each market peak, her big nest egg is thanks to the power of buying and holding. Since she never sold, her investment always recovered and flourished as the market inevitably recovered far surpassing her original entry points.

### Brittany Buys at the Bottom

Brittany, in stark contrast to Tiffany, was omniscient. She also saved her money in a savings account earning 3% interest, but she correctly predicted the exact bottom of each of the four crashes and invested all of her saved cash on those days. Once invested, she also held her index fund while saving up for the next market crash. It can’t be overstated, how hard it is to predict the bottom of a market. In 1990 with war breaking out in the Middle East, Brittany decided to dump all her cash in when the market was only down 19%. But in 2007, the market dropped 19% and she didn’t jump in until it fell all the way down to a 56% drop, again perfectly predicting the exact moment it had no further to fall and dumped in all of her cash just in time for the recovery.

For this impossibly perfect market timing, Brittany Bottom was rewarded. Her $96,000 of savings has grown to **$956,838** today. It’s certainly an improvement, but interesting to note that when comparing the absolute worst market timing versus the absolute best, the difference is only a 44% gain. Both Brittany and Tiffany have the vast majority of their growth thanks to buying and holding a low cost index fund.

### Slow and Steady Sarah

Sarah was different from her friends. She didn’t try to time market peaks or valleys. She didn’t watch stock prices or listen to doomsday predictions. In fact, she only did one thing. On the day she opened her account in 1979, she set up a $200 per month auto investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Then she never looked at her account again.

Each month her account would automatically invest $200 more in her index fund at whatever the current price happened to be. She invested at every market peak and every market bottom. She invested the first month and the last month and every month in between. But her money never sat in a savings account earning 3% interest.

When Sarah Steady was ready to retire, she signed up for online access to her account (since the internet had been invented since she last looked at it). She was pleasantly surprised with what she found. Her slow and steady approach had grown her nest egg to **$1,386,429**. Even though she didn’t have Brittany’s impossibly perfect ability to know the bottom of the market, Sarah’s investment crushed Brittany’s by more than $400,000.

### Recap

 * Amount Saved/Invested: $96,000 each
 * Investment: Buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund
 * Tiffany (worst timing in the world): $663,594
 * Brittany (best timing in the world): $956,838
 * Sarah (auto invests monthly): $1,386,429

So if you’re worried the market is too high and we’re due for a crash. Or you want to wait for the inevitable drop before you put your money in. Think about whether you’re so good at predicting the market you can do it better than Brittany who knew when to invest down to the exact day. And even if you are that good, realize that it’s still a losing strategy to the early and often approach that Sarah executed so flawlessly.

The pattern the authors found is that two incomes increases the risk of bankruptcy because the family consumes on a level that requires two incomes to support. However, two incomes means twice the chances of something going wrong like a lay-off, health problem or pregnancy. The authors go into much more detail on the inflation of costs like health care and housing over time as well as changes in consumption patterns like 2+ car families and larger housing. It also debunks myths like spending on luxury food and electronics as being the major cause of bankruptcy. It's all very numbers driven and geeky in a way I think this forum would like.

I read [The Two Income Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Two-Income-Trap-Elizabeth-Warren/dp/B0076AQQ6E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1549132882&sr=8-2&keywords=two+income+trap+elizabeth+warren) for the first time 12 years ago when I got married.

I'm the guy who quit his job in the US in June 2018 with naive dreams of frugally solo traveling the world by air, frugally solo traveling North America via van camper and spending more time with my friends and family in between.

Background: I'm 40 now, ethnically Chinese guy in Texas. I started working in my early 20s after getting out of grad school. Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession ten years ago.

I spent my first year in Thailand, I accepted a non-paid, volunteer teaching position with a Ministry of Justice program there that teaches English and job skills to low-level convicts and former prostitutes. Click my previous thread below to get a breakdown of my expenses and experiences living in Bangkok, traveling weekends through SE Asia on dirt cheap airfare costing as little as $20 a flight sometimes, the cheap street food and so forth.
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

My monthly expenses came out to about $850 with free housing. Would have been up to $1,350/month if I got a fancy flat and paid my own utilities, which is still crazy cheap by western standards. That includes heath insurance, eating out every meal, mass transit/taxi fare and spending money for shows and nicknacks. My net worth increased from $2.3 million from when I quit to $2.6 million when I came home from Thailand one year later, entirely from paper stock gains.

Year 1 went almost 100 percent according to plan. The first six months of Year 2 did, too. I took separate trips from the US to the UK, Spain, Mexico, Florida, New York and Minnesota, all on heavily discounted fares. Because when you're retired, you can take all of the odd-hour fares discounted at over 60-70 percent off, right? I stayed with friends, got cheap Airbnbs or used my hotel points to cut costs. It was great.

2020 comes and COVID-19 hits. My trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong was cancelled. A trip to Italy soon after, too. Then separate trips to Nevada and Boston, too. My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million.

My current expenses ... I own the house outright so no rent is great. Health insurance is covered by my old employer (while still in SE Asia, I was offered a remote work job by my old boss, like set aside 60-90 minutes a day to answer email and have him bounce ideas off of me. I originally said no but was swayed when told I could get health insurance covered and my 401k matching when I moved back to the states, have done it since. A nice side hustle for a fraction of my old salary.)

* $480 a month for property taxes and home insurance. That's right, per month. Property taxes are high here, the joys of home ownership.

* $70 a month for auto insurance, two cars, two drivers.

* $130 gasoline and auto maintenance. They're Toyotas, maintenance is really easy and the engines will run forever.

* $220 water, internet and power.

* $120 a month for four smartphones on a Sprint family plan. Yes, Sprint sucks but it's a great price that I've been grandfathered into for several years. I get a free Hulu sub and a free AAA sub with it, too.

* $140 groceries. I shop mostly at Aldi and grow several greens and fruits in my backyard.

* $60 for random upkeep around the house. Replacing a broken sprinkler head, buying wood chips, replacing a broken weedeater guard, batteries, light bulbs, buy a bag of potting soil, stuff like that.

= $1,220/month. I'm not including eating out or going to shows or movies because I'm inside the house all day every day. My $20 gym membership is suspended, I don't want to work out in an enclosed space until there's a vaccine or proven treatment.

Plans for Year 3 are wait out the pandemic for a vaccine or treatment. Stay home in the meantime. I miss flying. I fully expect flying to be a more miserable experience with less competition and higher prices when is does bounce back. It's unavoidable, I get it.

I'm still looking at a van to custom build a camper for one to travel to state and national parks in. I've ridden in my friend's Sprinter a few times and I'm now convinced it's too much room for one person. I've also decided that a camper van with on-board water, shower and toilet is unnecessary for me, I can just use a Planet Fitness membership or pay for showers at truck stops or campsites. The custom builds being offered for Nissan NV200 cargo vans with pop-top roofs are intriguing. Would cost about $23,000 for a new NV200, then another $20,000 to $30,000 for the camper build.

I am also intrigued by the ""camper mode"" being offered in the Tesla Model 3. It basically allows you to run the car's AC all night without killing the battery, meaning a climate controlled room. The backseat can be folded down and you have a completely flat floor to lie on, with your legs in the trunk of the car. Third-party vendors now sell mattress and bedding kits for you to use to sleep in the back of your Tesla all night, it's amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjC_ggNqbWA

At age 30,,4042,iscqef,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iscqef/truck_driver_i_will_achieve_financial/,1600052667.0,"I’m making this post mostly for myself so I can come back and look back at it in a couple years and also to inspire others in similar situations.

A little backstory: It was the year 2018 and I was a lost 22 year old that was going to community college because I thought there was no other way to get out of lower/middle class. I was attending full-time community college, while also working 50-60 hours a week as a full-time uber/lyft driver. I was making around $250-$350 / week after car expenses. I was basically wasting my time since I had no time to myself and was working just to pay the bills. One day I was driving, my brother texts me a book that I should listen to while driving. The book was called “Rich dad poor dad”. I listened to it and all the information went in the left ear and out the right ear without registering because I was too stressed from attending college and working full-time. 2 months or so go by and I start watching youtube videos on (FIRE) financial independence, retire early. I liked the idea but 99% of the people I watched had all these high paying jobs and right then that idea seemed impossible. Im stressed out again.

Around June, 2018 one night something clicked in my head that I can retire at a early age if I leave the united states and move to a low cost of living country. Since my parents were from India and I was raised in India and came to U.S at the age of 9. I would be very comfortable living there without any issues. I knew the cost of living there is so much cheaper than in the united states and I can retire early at age 30 if I really wanted to. I started doing my numbers to see how long and how much money invested it would take for me to achieve these goals.

As I became more invested in this idea, I decided not to continue my education after community college because I didn’t want to take out student loans that will eventually put me in the rat race where it would be difficult for me to get out of financially. Plus, I was only going to college for money. I started doing more research on careers that pay high income without a college degree and came across on-the-road trucking. At this point, I did not care how hard my life might get because I was set on one goal and that one goal was to retire by age 30 out of united states to a low cost of living country like india. In June 2018, I decided not to continue my education and instead went to go get my CDL Class A license. 

I got my license, got my 2 weeks of training and then drove for a company until August 2019. I saved up every penny after food expenses since I was living out of the truck. In August 2019, I purchased my own truck/trailer and got my own authority to become my own boss on the road. This is the month where my real journey starts. I have been Trucking with my own authority for almost 1 year and lived out of my truck and only went home to see my family couple times a year. I have cut out 99% of my expenses. No car, no debt, no mortgage, no rent and the only thing I have is food expenses and Netflix account and my truck/trailer payment. I finally saved up a good chunk of money that I am ready to buy my first real estate investment property cash. 

So far, my plan is perfectly on track and I should be able be able to retire at the age of 30 without a college degree. 

My numbers:

Current Age: 24

My FIRE number: $1000/month but I am going for fat fat fire and shooting around $4000. Even $2000 is close to impossible to spend in india a month. 

My pay: $260,000 / year gross and around $123,000 net after all expenses. I own my truck and trailer and have my own authority.

I am planning on buying 1 real estate property cash every other year and rent the property out. I mostly look for 9-14% ROI. I am currently looking at properties and waiting for the right one to come on the market.

In 2026, I will have 4 properties that I bought foreclosed at around $130,000-$150,000 price range and which will now be worth around $200,000 fully paid off and all rented out bringing in $4000 passive income and at that time, I should be able to leave the country and live my life freely in india and also travel the world because there is no way I’m spending any where near $4000/month in india. I will have property management company that will look after the properties and I will be available on call if I am needed.

I'm a long time follower/lover of this subreddit and the FI/RE movement. I happened to have retired at 36, though maybe not via the totally traditional route. I shared my story on my instagram page and it struck a chord so i thought you guys might want to see it here. The imgur link below has the story!

https://imgur.com/a/xjs2c7K

This really isn’t supposed to be a ""see how easy it is"" or ""anyone can do it the way I did"" post. I fully acknowledge I had a huge amount of privilege and unfair advantages. Graduating from college debt free thanks mostly to my parents is something that was simply gifted to me and allowed me to start a company. And living below my means and buying and holding index funds didn’t get me here alone.

That said, I did grow my net worth to over $100K on $36K/year living in high cost of living San Diego, and was well on my way to millionaire status within another decade or two. Also, had I taken that Microsoft job and lived at a similar level and invested, I’d be almost where I am today. So, just because I had a windfall, don’t write off the most likely and efficient way to build wealth: Live below your means and buy and hold index funds.

For you track fans, I ran the 400 and 800 in 46.8 and 1:49.8

Hope some of you might find this interesting! I'm happy to answer any questions if you have them! :)

My Story...",,3873,84g4p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/84g4p6/fi_cancer_and_dying_young_my_story/,1521055312.0,"Let me just start off by saying everything is going to be OK. I am going to try and make this short and sweet. I am not the best at writing, it was never my strong suit. I have been going back and forth if I should post this or not, but I think it will help a few.

When I was 27 years old I was diagnosed with colon cancer. I spent the next 3 years in and out of hospitals, had about 10 surgeries, lots of complications from said surgeries. I could have a rolodex of doctors and surgeons names that somehow have been involved in trying to fix me. I had sepsis twice (one time very severe), 12 months in a hospital bed being fed and hydrated through tubes (seriously never got to taste or drink anything for about 7 months), blood clots from my PICC lines and all sorts of the weirdest, gruesomest shit happen to me. I was about 170 pounds when I started, down to 115 in the hospital.

Anyways, after those awful 3 years I am finally home for good. It was hell but it is past me. I go in for my annual scan and my lungs lit up like a Christmas tree. Given my medical history and how late the cancer was when removed they assumed the worst.  I was given a year to live, or a year and half with chemo. They decided to a biopsy on my lungs, more as formality to confirm the cancer. I had about a 30 days before the biopsy. 30 days to start picturing how I want to live the rest of my short life.

This is where I want to relate with the rest of my financial independent people. I know some might feel nervous about never getting to experience the life you worked so hard for due to dying before reaching your goal.

I want to say that not once did I ever regret saving and building a nest egg for my future. I still felt like I lived a good life even though I saved a good portion of my money. In fact, I was relieved that I did. Knowing that I had a decent size portfolio that my wife would take over was such a relief. Knowing that she would still be taken care of, at least financially, when I was gone was a huge weight off my shoulder. I would not have changed anything in my past, even knowing I could have took bigger vacations, nicer cars and a bigger house. I was very content with the life I had. I seriously had not one ounce of regret that I saved so much of my income.

Just like I said though at the very top, everything is OK. The biopsy came back and it was negative for cancer. I have another condition named Sarcoidosis, which will look like lung cancer under a CT. Myself, the doctors, my wife, and family were all shocked. If it was in fact lung cancer, as of right now, I would probably be close to dead.

I am sure some of you on your way to financial independence considered the possibility of not surviving before reaching your goal. At least I know I did. What happens if you die young? What happens if you don't get to enjoy your nestegg that you worked so hard for? Now I know what it feels like. I had a nice, little townhouse, a wonderful wife, a little bratty dog, and took nice vacations with family and friends. Life was and is still very good. Just make sure you still live a good life on your journey to FI and I assure you will have no regrets.

Edit: I just want to thank all of you for the nice comments, stories, inspirations and of course the gold! You guys brightened up my day. Seriously, thank you, it is greatly appreciated.

310,Wealth is getting more and more concentrated among households that are averse to spending it.,,3855,ctyjyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ctyjyk/wealth_is_getting_more_and_more_concentrated/,1566485707.0,"""Your more typical millionaire, though, is tightfisted.""

Here's an interesting read from Bloomberg that notes people who have a lot saved up are not spending as much as they could. Furthermore, this tendency increases with age.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-22/nervous-retirees-with-money-to-spare-are-sitting-on-their-wealth

""BOTTOM LINE - Wealthy retirees’ reluctance to draw down their savings is trapping millions of dollars that could be stimulating the economy.""

My takeaway is that it is HARD to balance spending against both security and happiness.  And that is reflected here daily in arguments about what is a big enough FI number and what SWR can be used.

The affluent have formed accummulation habits over time; they literally save more than they spend.  They may experience hedonistic creep over time, but they manage to minimize the creep relative to their income.  The result is they are satisfied by minimal hedonistic creep and don't need to spend any more to be happy.

And as pointed out in the article, there is a lot of risk in the world - investment returns, medical costs, and longevity are mentioned.  The accummulators are reasonably protecting against these risks.

Th article argues that they should spend more to stimulate the economy, but there's no real discussion of metrics - how much savings is enough.  That's what I like about this community, that it gets into the weeds on this question.

311,Retiring in Southeast Asia might be a lot harder than you think,,3759,7trwzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7trwzo/retiring_in_southeast_asia_might_be_a_lot_harder/,1517228309.0,"I am a European guy, lived in Southeast Asia for over 10 years, worked and travelled a lot in Vietnam/Indonesia/Philippines/Thailand. 

Occasionally, a thread comes up where people discuss the naïve and romanticized idea to retire in one of these places on an Ultraleanfire budget. 

**I have seen this idea go horribly wrong countless times.**

**Mistakes to avoid when retiring to Southeast Asia**

* **#1 - Under-budgeting.** Many people vastly underestimate their costs and end up being broke. Lots of English teachers in Thailand are too broke to go home, forums are full of these stories (see more below at “income needed in Southeast Asia). Also: remember to budget for the move (temporary accommodation, sorting visas out, buying necessities in the new country). 
* **#2 - Bar girls.** I am not kidding. I work in a Fortune 500 company and there is an unofficial “policy” not to allow married guys to live in developing Southeast Asia without their spouses on a split-family delegation. Single guys get “the talk” from HR warning them, most of the time to no avail. At some point in time you will meet some nice lady in some bar and that is when all types of trouble start. Before you know it, you must help her out and buy her father a Toyota Hilux. Hyperbole aside, the huge difference in incomes leads to many people desperately looking for a partner from the West as a solution to their problems. There is a huge number of scams, but also desperation on both sides. Most often these situations end badly. The amount of drama I have seen… 

* **#3 - Relocating to Southeast Asia as a single Western female**: somehow it is mostly guys who want to move there, but I met many female expats as well. They tend to lament the fact that all Western guys seem to want to only date local women. At the same time, Western women typically are not into the local guys. I am sorry for the lack of political correctness in this statement, but it is really an issue you cannot ignore. 
* **#4 - Mental health**: a lot of people greatly underestimate the impact of moving yourself to a foreign country across the globe. Once the holiday is over, culture shock tends to set in. If you have never lived outside your home country you will 100% underestimate this. I have seen quite a few people who underestimated the challenges and became disillusioned. Many expats form enclaves in these countries and only talk to other Westerners in their bubble and/or resort to:

* **#5 - Alcohol/drugs/vices.** It is easy to get drawn into the party culture in some of the places. The amount of US people dying in countries like Thailand (drugs, drunken scooter riding etc.) speaks for itself. I remember a number of cases where the company had to bail people out. It can be the wild west out there and it is all fun and games until it isn’t. 
* **#6 - Running away from your issues by moving**: your issues will normally move with you, leading to compounding problems in #2, #4, #5. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of suicides. If you must you can google “Farang Deaths” for examples of #4, #5, #6.

* **#7 - Open a bar**: seriously, this is always a shitty idea that many people seem to have. It will most likely lose you money in your home country, but in a foreign country the odds are even more stacked against you. Also it will most likely lead to issues described in #1, #2, #4, #5.

* **#8 - Not to plan what to do there**: many people do not plan anything productive for their time living there. They just want it to be a never-ending holiday with beaches, parties and relaxation. In 95% of the cases that will lead to #2, #4, #5, #6 or even worse #7. Plan something productive to keep you occupied! 

**Further challenges of retiring in Southeast Asia:**

* It is **difficult to integrate** in some of the cultures, especially Thailand, Vietnam, Laos. Many western tourists treat Southeast Asia like a playground with natural beauty and cheap thrills, but do not understand the culture or the background. They have a great time, people smile and are friendly to them, but they truly do not understand the culture. It is not easy to make local friends and takes a lot of initiative and effort. 

* **Different values**. Even beneath the ""Western"" appearance of cities like Singapore there often is huge difference in values and culture below the surface. I am always surprised by how many of my coworkers advocate beating their kids and so on. 
* **Language:** Thai, Vietnamese, Mandarin are some of the hardest languages to learn because they are tonal. This is not like another Roman language that you could easily pick up. 

**Monthly income needed in Southeast Asia**

* **Basic living:** rent a cheap apartment, ride a scooter, basic healthcare, local food, little to no traveling: USD 1,200 a month. This is the bare minimum. At this budget, you will basically be stuck in this country and a plane ticket to the US will set you back 1.5 months of living expenses. You will be poor.  
* Comfortable life: At least USD 2,000 per month is needed.

**OK, you still want to go. How can you make it work:**

* **Most importantly: Do not give up your old life to live in SEA.** Try it for a few months. Learn the language. Try to make some local friends by being active in the community. 
* **Local partner:** If you happen to have a local partner you will have a much easier time. Cases where I saw people succeed were normally when there was a local partner in the picture. 
* Get sent there for work: try to get some type of expat assignment there. If you cannot get one, try and find a job. 

Maybe some other long time expats can help and chime in.

#The Story of Morgan and Hannah

To illustrate this point, I’d like to tell the story of friends, Morgan and Hannah. They each bought a home in 1989, exactly 30 years ago. And they both had identical assets at the time and identical incomes their whole careers. Specifically both Morgan and Hannah had:

* $30,000 in cash
* $2,000/month available for housing and investing

Where they differed was in how much house they bought.

###Morgan bought a mansion.

Morgan believed real estate was a great investment, so she went big. She bought a house for $150,000, the biggest house she could afford, believing it would go up in value. She used all $30,000 as a 20% down payment and took out a mortgage for the remaining $120,000.

###Hannah bought humbly. 

Instead of buying the biggest house possible, Hannah bought a more humble home with a lower down payment and lower monthly mortgage payment. Hannah bought a $75,000 house putting 20% or $15,000 towards the down payment and getting a mortgage for the other $60,000.

###Invest the rest.

Both Morgan and Hannah are believers in investing as well. So after all their housing expenses were paid from their budget, they invested the rest in an S&P 500 index fund. Hannah also dumped her remaining initial $15,000 in an S&P 500 index fund in 1989.

###Real estate did great.

Both of their homes more than doubled in value over the last 30 years. They both increased by the US average over that time, gaining 3.5% per year, and are now worth $415,587 and $207,794 respectively.

###The devil is in expenses.

While the home values both went way up, they also had to pay the expenses of homeownership along the way. Those expenses scaled with the cost of their homes, so Morgan ended up paying a lot more. Here’s a look at the breakdown of their monthly expenses and what was left to invest.

###Monthly Expenses:

|                |  Morgan ($150K home)| Hannah ($75K home)|
|:---------------|---------------------:|-------------------:|
| Monthly Budget |              $2,000|             $2,000|
| Mortgage       |                $743|               $371|
| Insurance |   $111|   $56|
| Maintenance | $589 | $295 |
| Property Tax | $285 | $143 |
| Total Monthly Cost | $1,729 | $864 |
| Left to invest in S&P 500 | $271 | $1,136 |

###Hannah indexed more.

As you can see due to the lower cost of living, Hannah was able to invest more in the S&P 500 index fund every month.

###Stocks did even better.

Over the last 30 years the stock market is up about 9.5% per year. That means Morgan’s $271/month investment grew to an impressive $419,032. But Hannah really did great. Her $15,000 lump sum plus $1,136 monthly investment grew the stock portion of her portfolio to a whopping $1,937,244.

###How it shook out.

Both women invested their whole $2,000/month in their primary home and the US stock market. But because Morgan bought twice as much house, she was saddled with twice as many home-related expenses. That means higher expenses AND more of her principal payments going into an asset returning 3.5%. Meanwhile, Hannah kept her sunk costs lower, and was putting more of her income into the stock market returning 9.5%. After 30 years, despite identical starting cash and monthly investments, Humble Hannah ended up over 2.5X more wealth than Morgan in her mansion. In 2019 Hannah’s net worth is $2,145,038 compared to Morgan’s $834,520

###Even worse for FI/RE.

Hannah's net worth was over 2.5X that of Morgan's but her *invested assets* ended up 4.6X higher. Compounding the problem even more Hannah's living expenses were lower. That means Hannah hit her FI/RE number years ago and Morgan still can't retire on 4% of her investments.

###The forced savings account.

You often hear that your primary home is an investment. That’s true, but it’s more akin to a forced savings account with a negative return. Over the 30 years each of my friends owned their homes they both paid in 1.5X the home’s final worth in total payments. So while they were paying down the principal on that loan, the net result after expenses was effectively a savings account paying -1.5% interest per year. That doesn’t mean buying is bad. Your primary residence is an expense however you live. But don’t fall into the trap of believing a bigger home is a better investment.

314,Timing the market: Absolute worst vs absolute best vs early and often (Updated),,3686,iq30q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iq30q8/timing_the_market_absolute_worst_vs_absolute_best/,1599743569.0,"I downloaded the historic S&P 500 data going back 41 years. I dumped everything in Google Sheets and modeled three different portfolios named after three fictional friends Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah. All three saved $200 of their income per month for 41 years for a total of $99,000 each. But after 41 years they all ended up with different amounts based on their investment strategies.

# Buy and Hold

Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah all knew the value of buying and holding. And they all invested in the same thing: an S&P 500 index fund. Once they bought, they never sold and always reinvested dividends. But they had different strategies about when to jump into the market.

# Two Market Timers

Tiffany and Brittany were aware that the stock market could be very volatile and they wanted to avoid market crashes. It turns out they were right as there were five significant market crashes during the last 41 years as shown here:

# Tiffany Top invests at the top of the market

Tiffany, it turns out, has the world’s worst market timing. She saved her $200/month in a savings account getting 3% interest until the worst possible times. She started by saving for 8 years only to put her money in at the absolute market peak in 1987, right before Black Monday and the resulting 33% crash. But she never sold, and instead started saving her cash again, only to do the same at the next five market peaks. Each time she invested the full amount of her saved cash only to watch the market crash immediately after. Most recently she put all her money in the day before the 2020 COVID crash, only to see it immediately drop 34%. She’s been saving cash ever since waiting for the next market peak.

With this perfectly bad market timing, Tiffany still didn’t do too bad. Her $99,000 she saved and invested over the last 41 years is now worth $773,358. Even though she invested only at each market peak, her big nest egg is thanks to the power of buying and holding. Since she never sold, her investment always recovered and flourished as the market inevitably recovered far surpassing her original entry points.

# Brittany Bottom invests at the bottom of the market

Brittany, in stark contrast to Tiffany, was omniscient. She also saved her money in a savings account earning 3% interest, but she correctly predicted the exact bottom of each of the five crashes and invested all of her saved cash on those days. Once invested, she also held her index fund while saving up for the next market crash. It can’t be overstated, how hard it is to predict the bottom of a market. In 1990 with war breaking out in the Middle East, Brittany decided to dump all her cash in when the market was only down 19%. But in 2007, the market dropped 19% and she didn’t jump in until it fell all the way down to a 56% drop, again perfectly predicting the exact moment it had no further to fall and dumped in all of her cash just in time for the recovery. Just this year in 2020, Brittany wisely waited until March 23rd to dump her savings into the market, buying at a steep 34% discount.

For this impossibly perfect market timing, Brittany Bottom was rewarded. Her $99,000 of savings has grown to $1,123,573 today. It’s certainly an improvement, but interesting to note that when comparing the absolute worst market timing versus the absolute best, the difference is only a 45% gain. Both Brittany and Tiffany have the vast majority of their growth thanks to buying and holding a low cost index fund.

# Sarah Steady auto-invests every month

Sarah was different from her friends. She didn’t try to time market peaks or valleys. She didn’t watch stock prices or listen to doomsday predictions. In fact, she only did one thing. On the day she opened her account in 1979, she set up a $200 per month auto investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Then she never looked at her account again.

Each month her account would automatically invest $200 more in her index fund at whatever the current price happened to be. She invested at every market peak and every market bottom. She invested the first month and the last month and every month in between. But her money never sat in a savings account earning 3% interest.

When Sarah Steady was ready to retire, she signed up for online access to her account (since the internet had been invented since she last looked at it). She was pleasantly surprised with what she found. Her slow and steady approach had grown her nest egg to $1,620,708. Even though she didn’t have Brittany’s perfect ability to know the bottom of the market, Sarah’s investment crushed Brittany’s by about $500,000.

# Recap
* **Amount Saved/Invested**: $99,000 each
* **Investment**: Buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund
* **Tiffany (worst timing in the world)**: $773,358
* **Brittany (best timing in the world)**: $1,123,573
* **Sarah (auto invests monthly)**: $1,620,708

Tiffany, Brittany and Sarah aren’t real. No one can perfectly predict market tops or bottoms. But these numbers are real, based on the exact returns of an S&P 500 index fund and a 3% interest savings account over the last 41 years. [Here is the spreadsheet I used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBDkD9Zrjb3VZJy6ZjmPCd3ehoagKMIkw6m3WZvxeTw/edit?usp=sharing) to generate these results.

If you’re worried the market is too high and we’re due for a crash. Or you want to wait for the inevitable drop before you put your money in. Think about whether you’re so good at predicting the market you can do it better than Brittany who knew when to invest down to the exact day. And even if you are that good, realize that it’s still a losing strategy to the early and often approach that Sarah executed so flawlessly.

315,38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,,3651,8pv2yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/,1528571370.0,"Link to my thread from six months ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7eo4wi/38msingle_crossed_2_million_today/

Long story short, I have had this job for over a decade out of grad school. Pay is solid, hours are great and I didn't hate the work, but my heart has been out of it for awhile. As I approached FIRE in recent years, I allowed myself to travel up to eight times a year. Did zero travel before then, my singular focus was FIRE. I absolutely fell in love with southeast Asia, Thailand in particular.  Rich culture, dirt cheap cost of living, cheap airfare to the rest of the region. A close friend saw all my photos that I posted and decided to go herself, fell in love with it too and joined a non-profit that helps to teach English and hospitality and computer job skills to former prostitutes. They offered me a volunteer job and sponsored my work visa application, which was approved by the Thai consulate last Monday. I sat on my resignation letter for the rest if the week since my boss just returned from vacation and I didnt want to drop it on him right when he returns.

They will provide me a studio flat in Bangkok to live in with their other expat volunteers. My work visa is valid for a year. I am expected to teach and work four days a week and my three day weekends are free for me to explore. Food will be dirt cheap, street food is everywhere in central Bangkok and one to two bucks USD at most. My health insurance there looks to be reasonable, as well.

I have been putting off FIRE for a few years due to my parents being uninsured immigrants with no retirement savings, I have always planned on helping them retire comfortably. They are now reaching Medicare and Social Security age so the numbers make sense for me to FIRE safely. They have no idea of my net worth, nor does anyone else other than my little sister who has to know as executor of my will.

All I need to do now is tie up my affairs stateside, study conversational Thai and order a one way ticket. My long term plans are to stick out the entire year no matter what, come home, buy and convert a used Sprinter van and spend the year after that boondocking through Alaska, Canada and the lower 48. We shall see. 

[edit] I never even considered travelling abroad until I began watching Anthony Bourdain's first show, A Cook's Tour, over 15 years ago. My mind was already made up to do this long before he died yesterday, sure. But it makes me all the more sure of what I am doing. I look forward to my trips to Vietnam, his first love. Round trip airfare from Bangkok to Saigon or Hanoi on AirAsia or Jetstar or Nok Air is as low as 50 bucks USD, IIRC. Cheap to Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia too. I can't wait.

[edit 2 ] I'm an ethnically Chinese American. Have lived in the south all my life, so I do have a southern accent. Can speak Mandarin and Spanish. Fun fact - I have learned people are very wary of tourists from China due to their track record of poor behavior. In Dublin, Zurich, Doha, Miami and LA, I have had amusing interactions with hotel staff who expressed relief I am an American instead of from China.

[edit 3] The guy that originally got me interested in Thailand is Mark Weins on YouTube. I can't link his channel directly because I am on my phone - I urge you to add him and watch his videos. His enthusiasm is innocent and his reactions are borderline corny, but it is highly entertaining and informative.",financialindependence
316,"14 years ago I was 27 years old. I paid off my debts, saved $4,000 for emergencies, lined up a new job with a 30% pay cut, and took a one way flight to Australia out of Philadelphia.",,3634,8t7reu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8t7reu/14_years_ago_i_was_27_years_old_i_paid_off_my/,1529730654.0,"I spent 7 years in Australia, living relatively frugally in Sydney, an expensive city. The weather was always wonderful and there were miles and miles of beautiful beaches.  I biked to work and had a flatmate (roommate).  We lived by a bay where I watched the sun setting and the pelicans flying in for the night.

I saved $100,000 living like that.  Then, after 7 years, I became a naturalized citizen of Australia.  Around the same time, I lost my job due to the economic downturn, but I got a severance package.  So another $100,000, straight in the bank, still there too, with interest.  Found a new job a week later and got a $10,000 per year raise too.

My fiance dumped me when I lost my job (when it rains it pours), I didn't like the new job so much, and this was at the same time US real estate had crashed to the bottom.  My brother's wife was selling foreclosures for Fannie Mae through a contract company.  She was pregnant and couldn't keep up.  My brother said come on back and help us out.  So I moved to the Rocky Mountains and learned to be a real estate agent, mostly taking the courses online.  I sold foreclosures and short sales, bought a condo of my own, and found a regular job on the night shift at a local factory.  This condo was right downtown, new construction, a luxury condo, near everything good, but the building was only half full.  Nobody was buying them, except fools like me.  I thought it was awesome and it seemed cheap for what it was with floor to ceiling windows and spectacular views of the snow covered Rocky Mountains.  It had a swimming pool, hot tub, a gym, and I could walk to bars and restaurants.  

Two years went by and I just kept on saving.  Still biked to work, but also bought a motorcycle.  I was the only real estate agent who used a motorcycle, lol.  I didn't really see myself as a real estate agent, that was always temporary.  In my mind, I was just helping people sort their way out of a crisis.  My real job was on the night shift, in the factory.  Then a facebook friend from my old job in Australia (the one that laid me off) told me she'd just turned down a job offer in Indonesia with our old boss.  She had little kids and couldn't do it.  It sounded great to me, so I sent him an email.  

I got the job, incorporated myself one afternoon, and moved to Indonesia.  Suddenly I was a genuine independent international consultant for a big time Dow Component company, on the preferred vendor list.  The deal was I worked for 1 month, then I was off for 1 month, then another month of work, another month off.  I did that for 4 years.  During that time, I spent 800+ days in hotel rooms.  I never went home.  I rented out the condo.  It's been occupied 100% of the time since then and the rent covers all the costs, plus I make a little bit too.

Then I got married.  I was 39 years old by then.  I rented a house on a golf course in Indonesia, adjusted my contract with the company, bought a minivan, and started working full time again.  We had two babies almost immediately.

After the second baby was born, the company offered me a full-time in house job in Singapore, maybe the best city in the world all-around.  Since mama didn't raise a fool, I left that consulting gig behind.  It was a good run, but trading the chaos of Indonesia for the stability and lifestyle of Singapore with two babies was a no-brainer.  

So now I'm 41 years old and I live in a rented apartment in Singapore.  My savings is just shy of the 2 comma number, but not by a lot.  We have a live-in maid/nanny.  My wife doesn't work.  My job is pretty intense at times, but I am proud to have it and enjoy the opportunities for learning that it provides.  They pick me up for work with a shuttle service in the morning and drop me off again at night, so I don't need a car.  After the sun sets, I put my 2 year old on the back and we bike ride a little ways down the bike path and up a hill and look out at the boats floating by on the South China sea before bedtime.

Before lunchtime today, I have heard my 2 year old greet his visiting grandparents in Arabic, count in English, express his thanks in Mandarin, ask for food in Javanese, and tell his mom he was finished taking a bath in Bahasa Indonesia.  He only turned 2 this month.

I don't really aspire to retire, I just want to do what I want, or what I like.  Ever since I had no debt and $4,000 in the bank for emergencies when I was 27, that's what I do, what I want.  Work brought me to all these places and plugged me into the community, made me a contributor.  Every place I went, I made it better and contributed somehow. I made real friends, people I worked with and lived with too.

Airplanes changed the world, and that's only really happened in the last 50 years.  People buy a round-trip ticket and they go on a tour and take some pictures.  I do that too.  It's really fun, but I sometimes think how it's really different from how it used to be.  Not so long ago, people got on a boat and left, maybe forever.  They didn't look back.  That's how I thought of it, I just don't look back.  I might go back, but not in a backwards direction, just because the world is round.

I got a lot of passport stamps I guess.  I don't know how many, fewer than a lot of people though since that was never my goal.  I think probably 20, maybe 30 countries.  Here's a picture of how I multiplied my US passport since 2004. There's a lot of access represented in this photo to education, healthcare, ownership of homes and businesses, etc.  I couldn't put a number on what it's all worth, priceless I think.

317,My experience of FIRE five years in.,,3570,7ggla6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7ggla6/my_experience_of_fire_five_years_in/,1511988841.0,"I posted this in part because I hope it will be of some use to those of you who are on the road to FI and because I am interested in the perspective of others.  

I am in my 40’s, live in a large US city.  Never married, no kids.  

I stopped working about 5 years ago.  The experience has been largely good, but mixed.  

The good:

—If, 15 years ago, someone had asked me to design the ideal life, I would have described the life I am now living.  I spend my time indulging in my passions and other healthy pursuits, I have traveled the world extensively, I have done most of the things that I always wanted to do and I am continually thinking up new ideas.

 —Living an authentic life.  Some people think I am a bit of an oddball (middle aged, never married, no kids).  So be it — I am not struggling to fit into someone else’s mold. For years I was faking it so that I would be well regarded by some boss/girlfriend/professional community, etc.   No more.   Employers want you to be one thing, your girlfriend wants you to be something else.  So does your church.  So does the community into which you were born.  They all want you to be something—often they nudge you to become what they mistakenly believe will make you happy.  Sometimes they just want to live their lives through you.  Regardless, when I was employed I was somewhat pressured by my employer to live a life that was not entirely authentic. FI means I am as free as I choose to be—I am not beholden to, or dependent upon, any person or entity. 

—Finantial peace of mind. I have virtually no financial restraints. I don’t have unlimited money but I have much more than enough to do whatever I want.  I love having steady income (bond yields, dividends, rental income) without having to work. The securities are easy, the RE has a manager.  I probably have to put about ten hours of work per month into making decisions, signing documents, talking on the phone, etc.  Almost everything can be done with a laptop, a phone and the occasional visit to a notary.   

—The clarity that came with financial independence, including freedom from the delusion that more money would solve everything. I used to think that my life would radically improve if only I had more money.  I now have much more than I need, and while FI has improved my life in some areas it has also helped to clarify the degree to which money has a very limited impact on the things that matter most to me.  Including:

1-Health.  Money does not eliminate most health threats, including the physical and/or intellectual decline that eventually comes to everyone.  However, FI frees me from stress inducing and soul crushing bureaucracies and people.   I also have effectively unlimited time and money to pursue a healthy lifestyle

2-Interpersonal relationships with family and close friends.  Aside from health, nothing is as important to me.  An abundance of high quality and meaningful relationships is absolutely essential.  Money has had virtually no impact on the most important relationships in my current life, although it has complicated some important romantic relationships.

3-Meaningful activities.  Helping the people I care about.  Doing good for others, even for strangers.  Working every day to be a better version of myself.  Living a life consistent with my values.  



The bad:


—Deceit.  About half of the people in my life don’t know that I am FI or how much I travel.  I may be gone for a month but they just assume that I have been in town and they just have not seen me in a while, or that I was traveling for work.  I am effectively deceiving/lying to them.  When they ask about work, I am vague and circumspect.  Why? I am a private person.  I am wary of envy, animosity, judgment etc.. No good comes from people knowing that I am rich.  Most of my life long friends know.   A few recent friends know, but very few.  Some suspect but we don’t discuss it.  The deception is stressful for me.  I am looking for a way to resolve this and live more honestly with everyone. 

—Loneliness.  Traveling the world and doing whatever I want to do whenever I choose to do it can be lonely.  My friends usually cannot join me on my adventures due to various limiting factors (family, job, finances, health).  So I go alone.-sometimes for months at a time.  I am sometimes lonely when I am away.  And when I am home I am often lonely as well—I don’t work and that means I don’t have the regular day to day interaction with my old colleagues.  Most of my friends are now married and have children so even on weekends it is hard to get together.  I seek human interaction through my pursuits, volunteering, travel, etc, but its not the same as regular contact with a group of people who have known each other for years.  

—Lack of structure or goals. I work very hard at imposing structure on myself because the lack of structure that FI facilitates can be disorienting.  I plan trips, take classes and engage in lots of exercise. I go out of my way to initiate social activities with friends.   But creating structure takes a lot of effort and sometimes I get lazy and spend days alone with little to do.   Further,  living alone with no career makes it hard to envision a future.  I don’t have any idea where I will be in 20 years.  If I had kids I would envision my relationship with them when they were grown and had kids themselves.  If I had a career I would look ahead and plan a career path and objectives.  I have had several careers, none of which was a true calling.  One of my main goals in life was to be completely financially independent. OK, I’m there, and I live the life I have always wanted.  But I have no long term goals.  Like many people, I need goals, so I set up little goals for myself like exploring Bolivia or Singapore, but I don’t have any long term goals.  


So it has been a mix.  My focus now is to increase my social network and interaction and try to develop new long term goals.  I encourage everyone on the path to financial independence  to maintain and develop passions, hobbies, health and relationships along the way.  When you get there, these factors will be as important to you as your FI.   

 I welcome all comments or questions.  

-----------------------------


EDIT:
I am humbly astonished at all of the positive feedback.  

In response to some of the trends in the comments, feel free to contact me anytime.  I am always happy to give my perspective with the caveat that I am not a qualified financial professional of any kind and you should take what I say with a grain of salt. For all you know I am a 13 year old compulsive liar with 35 cents in my pocket and a stolen laptop



With respect to the conflicts between the benefits and struggles inherent to FIRE, sometimes the good and bad go hand in hand. Imagine  that you are in exactly the situation you dream of. The ideal location, engaged in your passions, completely FI.  Its great.  But after a little while feelings of discomfort develop and you reflect on this supposedly perfect situation, and you think to yourself: is this it? Is this really as good as its going to get?

When I was striving to get to my ideal situation I thought that I would one day achieve some sort of perfect existence of happiness, contentment, fulfillment, etc. I felt deprived of X,Y and Z and I wanted to indulge in all of the things that I thought would fulfill me.  And getting there has been great and I have had five years filled with some extraordinarily meaningful and enriching experiences, relationships and growth. But a lot of it has also been somewhat lonely, self indulgent and meaningless.   So, having achieved my goals, I am confronted with an uncomfortable reality-life is never going to be perfect and the grass is always going to be greener.  I now look back on my years of struggle with nostalgia. 

There is a conflict between, on the one hand, unlimited freedom, autonomy, wealth, etc, and on the other hand, community, meaning, and the fulfillment that comes with giving to others, joining with others, committing myself to a noble endeavor, etc. 

Finding the balance between the two impulses (self indulgence vs. generosity/community/interdependence) is a continual struggle.




Thanks for your comments, insights and advice. Its been helpful.  I will consider an update in the future.  And thanks for the gold, strangers!

Didn't get to posting until today because I was too busy doing whatever the fuck I want.

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!",financialindependence
320,"Making what I used to consider a ridiculously stupid purchase, but realized some things are worth it.",,3488,9vljmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9vljmv/making_what_i_used_to_consider_a_ridiculously/,1541778720.0,"So I'm usually the guy who puts savings over all else. Every cent of extra money, I'm trying to stuff into retirement savings or my brokerage account. I agonize over every dollar. I want to FIRE so badly someday. I look to see where I can save at every turn, and I would normally NEVER consider buying a motorcycle again, as it is a lot of money for very little use (especially in WI). So here's where things changed:

My dad is a vintage Harley guy. He's always had one and I remember riding on the back of his many times when I was a kid. When I graduated high school, I had money from working every summer and decided to buy a used one. I owned it for two years and my dad and I rode often those two summers. It was awesome, but I was in college and needed money for other things, so I sold it. I sold it for maybe 500 less than I bought it, so not a terrible financial decision by any means. My dad was pretty down about it at the time, but understood why.

Fast forward 5 years later, I make good money, have a fiance who I'm going to marry next summer who makes good money, and have a hair over 125k in retirement accounts and cash at 26. I feel like I'm doing quite well. My dad asked me if he could store his Harley in my garage for the winter, and said ""Hey, I don't really ride much anymore, your mom doesn't like it anymore either and I have no one to go with. Would you want to buy my bike?""

I've always had that urge in the back of my head to get another bike, but my FI desire always outweighed it. At first I thought this was an awesome thing though. My dad would give me a good deal, and I would know what I'm getting. Then I realized, one of the main reasons I wanted a bike again was to go riding with him. I don't want to buy his and go by myself. It was about spending time with him and sharing a hobby. I asked him if I got another one, if he would keep his and ride together, his eyes lit up. ""Hell ya!"" Well that was all she wrote. I decided I'm buying a bike again (nice used one). My dad is getting up there and we only have so much time to do stuff like this together again, so I'm pulling the trigger.

Wanted to share this because it has been a huge shift in perspective for me and it seems like a common theme on this sub about balancing life and happiness with FIRE. I decided this is something I'm willing to trade time for at the end of my career.

EDIT: Just want to thank everyone for their responses and sharing their stories. Reinforces I'm making the right decision. 

I'll try to answer some of the more common questions I saw:

* My old man rides an 03 100th Anniversary Heritage Softail Classic (Sorry I don't have any photos right now)
* I received full tuition remission to college and got a comp sci degree. This is the biggest factor in my fast early savings. No loans of any kind.
* I have considered many other bikes than just Harley's, but I've got my heart set on one now...",financialindependence

Some of you may have seen the recent hurricane that hit the Texas/Louisiana border. It was a massive storm that completely ruined the city of Lake Charles, LA. My town was going to be ground zero until a couple hours before the storm hit. It veered East and we were spared the complete devastation.

We evacuated Tuesday because our mayor begged people not to stay behind and risk their life. My company drug it’s feet on whether we would be “allowed” to evacuate. It wasn’t until the judge issued a mandatory evacuation that we weren’t forced by work to stay. 

I woke up today and found out that our town and home were safe and sound. The storm passed around 5 am. I got a call from my boss around 10am asking when I was coming home. Our regional manager is now furious that we are not at work today (5 hours after the storm passed) and that we are abusing this to take a vacation. I told my boss that this was no vacation. Wondering if the house I’ve worked my ass off to have would be ripped to shreds. Wondering if the nursery we have put together for my future son would still look the same. Instead of sympathy from management, the employees were treated like an enemy of the company for trying to keep their family safe.

I ramble so much about this because I work with people who have to take this treatment. Paycheck comes in, paycheck goes out. They have to endure it. I’m not close to my FI goal, but I know that on the horizon I will be able to walk away from a company that has reduced me to just a production number.

It is important to keep strong on the journey. I have questioned if it’s possible to be free one day, but now I know that not only is it possible, it’s necessary.",financialindependence
324,"Confession: I panicked, it cost me a lot. Don't let it happen to you, even if you have to pay for it.",,3288,imoao6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/imoao6/confession_i_panicked_it_cost_me_a_lot_dont_let/,1599253476.0,"**TL;DR** I panicked, sold it all, went to US Treasuries, lost about $300k (compared to doing nothing).  I'm still not fully back in the market.  Don't be like me.  

We all know how it should work.  Pick your asset allocation.  Squirrel away.  Rebalance.  Do some roth conversions. Keep living costs low. Build a tent to mitigate sequence of returns risk.  Sail off into the sunset.   

I could go into why I decided to sell everything and buy US Treasuries, but by this time in my journey, I should have known better.  But I did on April 1, 2020.  

Fortunately I had a plan to get back in, but that plan did not indicate re-entry until August 1, 2020.  But by then psychology was already working against my best interests, ""I can't get back in now! Near the highs?""  

So I determined to reinvest in 5 chunks.  I would set limit orders 2-4% off recent highs and if those didn't trigger by month end I would change them to market orders to ensure entry.  Well August saw no such pullback.  7% higher.  

$#@!  I put in August's 1/5 chunk and set orders for Sep, which all got filled yesterday in the sell off.  So I am 40% back into my standard 80/20 portfolio.  

I made a spreadsheet with my positions on March 31, 2020.  I compared that to the same portfolio on August 31, 2020.  The portfolio I liquidated was worth $1.4M.  That same portfolio would be worth$1.7M untouched on August 31.  

I missed out on $302,659.98 of capital gains.  To say nothing of the dividends I missed out on nor the tax implications of what I did in March.  

Some perspective: 

* That money invested would pay for college tuition for my 2 children just about anywhere for 4 years when they turn 18.
* That loss will likely push off my retirement by 3-5 years
* Or if I keep the same target date, I will have to spend about $25k/year less in retirement.
* Or I could have just quit my job, bought a yacht, and sailed the world for the last 5 months and have been better off.  

I know we like to say that financial advisors are too expensive, not worth it, etc, but someone who had simply said ""Don't be a muppet and stay the course"" would have earned 19 years' worth of fees.  

This is the behavior gap: the difference between what an asset class earns and what an irrational/fearful investor earns investing in the same asset class.  It is real.  It is expensive.  Good luck closing it.  

Stay safe out there.  Learn from my stupidity; I hope I have.",financialindependence
325,How do I make money when I inherently hate the system?,,3273,khzymp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/khzymp/how_do_i_make_money_when_i_inherently_hate_the/,1608619029.0,"I’m Black and from the hood. Me and everyone I know has been stuck in perpetual poverty our whole lives. I articulate myself, and I suppose I’m fairly clever. But as far as knowledge on how to make money work for me, healthy work patterns, wealth building habits, and financial literacy I have none. 

Many people born in my situation never put effort into anything. I’ve been reading books, trying to save money, seeking mentors/apprenticeships/resources since I was 13 (I’m 23 now). 

I’m at a loss. I’m traumatized, so it’s hard for me to trust. I don’t have transportation, or a house. I have ONE living family member who has Schizophrenia. I haven’t been homeless, but I’ve been staying in a friends laundry room for 2 months. There’s always a factor that comes up in my life that prevents security. 

What do you do to build ANY type of consistency for yourself when you:

1.) Don’t have a car or license 
2.) Don’t have a house
3.) Don’t have financial literacy
4.) Don’t have a degree 
5.)Don’t have a computer (I have a phone). 
6.) Are Black with one face tattoo
7.) Have aspergers Syndrom (I also have aspergers, though I am high functioning)
8.) I do have multiple visual arts skills (graphic design, painting, embroidery, screen printing, composing murals, but I don’t have a income stream to fund any pursuits that take money to operate). 
9.) I don’t have any felonies luckily. The face tattoo is from a time when I had to do dirt for survival at 16 years old, and I haven’t been in the streets for over 7 years. 

Any advice is good. I wish I was anyone else daily. I’ve been asking this same question for months. In the mean time I’ve been doing odd jobs to save money, but cost of living vs money I’m making doesn’t add up. When I say I’m smart, and a good addition to a team I mean it. But corona is impacting my legitimacy. I have the type of mind where, I’m great at making other businesses better.",financialindependence

A lot of people are having a rough time out there, and it makes me determined not to squander this amazing gift.  Yeah, I worked hard, but so have a lot of others.

Last week was a whirlwind of farewells, parties, happy hours and friends taking me to lunch to celebrate.  I left on very good terms, and everyone was genuinely happy for me.  They made it clear I was welcome to return later should things change.

I spent a few minutes looking around my old haunts, shook hands with my boss one last time and drove home.  It feels really weird right now, and I'm still getting out of the mindset that I have to finish something before Monday.  I hope to never again set eyes on an Outlook calendar.

Maybe a little dorky, but this was my retirement farewell speech for the reception at work:

We don’t recognize it at the time, but a year comes along where summer is spent working, then in school, then career, and after a while summertime is just walking across a hotter parking lot at work.  My last summer was 1974, with my two best friends -- playing and swimming at the lake.*

*Today I’m restarting summertime, after a 45 year interruption.*

So no firm plans for now, just short term.  Since it's the 4th, I have an appointment with my boat, Jimmy Buffet, and a full cooler of beer.  That might be my plan for the next week too!

I'm unhappy in my job, I feel out of place in it. It's paying me 120k a year for 40 hours a week with great benefits. It's unfulfilling, stressful, and unrewarding. I'm debt free, house paid off, under 10 years to FIRE, paid off cars, healthy family, good work/life balance in terms of time off... but damnit, I'm feeling a lot of despair. I wonder if it's because my biggest goal is just a matter of time and beyond my control. Paying off the mortgage, cars, cutting spending, enjoying not buying things, having free time, I have all those things, all those goals are met. I can't shake this feeling of restlessness and even fear about FIRE because that means I'm going to be older and might have just 'gotten by' until FIRE which concerns me. I'd like some meaning in my life but working and waiting until fire are not that meaningful like I thought they'd be.

From the outside looking in, I'm living the dream of so many people when it comes to status in the middle class and the fact that I'm feeling down makes me feel even *more* down because I think to myself that I'm acting like a spoiled brat, that I should just shut the hell up and be thankful I have a job at all and not think about meaning in work.

Here's My Story.,,3198,atx838,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/atx838/just_hit_300k_nw_26_years_old_82k_income_heres_my/,1550939831.0,"Hi guys. I've been a subscriber and lurker here for over 5 years and one of my favorite things to read are the ""how you got to where you are"" stories. I told myself that once I hit $300k, I'd tell the first \~5 years of my FIRE story. I hate lack of transparency and ambiguity, so I'll try to be as open as I can. I tried to include everything that I would want to know if I was reading someone else's post. Feel free to ask me any questions.

**There is a TLDR at the bottom of this post. You probably want to read that first to see if you're interested before investing your time in conquering this wall of text.**

**Also, you can skip the wall of text below about my childhood/college/relationship stuff if you're just interested in the ""numbers"". I just wanted to include this background to provide context and credibility.**

* **Age:** Current age is 26. Discovered FIRE via MMM in October 2012 at the age of 19. It blew my mind.
* **Childhood:** I come from a rural, solidly middle-class background. I owe all my success with my academics, career, and finances to my parents. My dad is a mechanic and my mom is a nurse. Both are very frugal and they passed that down to me. They are natural savers and maxxed out their 401(k)s and IRAs every year on their modest incomes. We never had the ""nicest"" things growing up, but they gave me an amazing childhood. They also valued ""experiences"" more than ""things"", so we would grow up going on trips to Washington DC, NYC, Philadelphia, San Francisco, etc. instead of buying me the latest video game console or Abercromie clothes. They also pushed upon me the value of education. They had high academic expectations for me and I was always at the top of the class because of it. #thanksmomanddad
* **College Years:** I received a bachelors in business from a top public in-state university. I was in-state, so it was already a great value, but I was also very fortunate to receive a full-ride academic scholarship from the university. In high school I was valedictorian. I also had good test scores and very good extracurriculars. My parents saved about $20k for me to go to college in a 529 plan. They gave $10k of that to my sister since she didn't receive any scholarships and gave me the other $10k as a college graduation gift. This is the only ""windfall"" that I've ever received (other than my scholarships). I also received another \~$1,000 a year from a couple other small scholarships that I won. Those scholarships obviously covered my tuition and books, but I still worked a few jobs in college to pay for living expenses and save the extra. My last 3 years of college I was an RA for campus housing. The way this worked was that I lived in the dorm with freshman students as a student leader and in return I got my dorm housing and meal plan paid for. Since I already had a full scholarship, I essentially got to ""bank"" this money (roughly $4k a semester) for 8 semesters. Starting my 2nd year of college I also got a job working 10 hours per week at a local law office making $10 per hour. I did this job for about 2 years. After my 2nd year I got a summer internship working for a local Fortune 500 company making $19 per hour. I worked this job all summer and then convinced them to let me stay on part time working 20 hours per week for my entire 3rd year of college. So my 3rd year of college I worked as an RA in student housing (very little ""work""), at the law firm 10 hours per week, at the Fortune 500 20 hours per week, and took a full course load (\~15 credits). This was the first time in my life that I really started making money and was getting addicted to making money and saving money. At the end of my 3rd year of college I left my corporate internship and got a different summer internship at a different local Fortune 500 company making $29 per hour. I quit working at the law office around this time, but was still an RA. I worked this internship all summer and at the end of the summer I received a full-time job offer to work for this company once I graduated the next May. I really liked this company and this industry so I accepted the offer. I also convinced them to let me stay on part-time working 30 hours per week while I finished my last year of college. My senior year I was only working this internship and my RA job while taking a full course load. This only worked because I would work from \~7am-1pm every day because I scheduled my classes so that they were all in the afternoon. Because of all these jobs and the scholarships, I graduated with no student debt and was able to save \~$60k after my other expenses. I maxed out my Roth IRA my last 3 years of college and also put some extra money in a taxable account. The rest I saved in cash. I didn't graduate with a perfect GPA, but it was still above a 3.50.
* **Relationship:** The most important part of my life is my SO. We went to high school together and college together. We've been dating for 9 years. She is (now) very frugal and a great saver. She comes from a low-income household and received a few grants and scholarships every year, which paid for most of her college. The other half was paid from her working a co-op ($16/hr), summer internship ($18/hr), and part-time job on campus ($8/hr). She graduated with no debt, an engineering degree, and $20k saved up. We've lived together for the past 4 years (splitting rent!) and are getting married in a couple months. Since this is a financial subreddit, I'll just go ahead and tell you that our wedding will cost $9k-11k. All of the numbers below about my budget/income/savings do not include her numbers. We split everything 50/50 even though my income is a little higher. She is dead-set on the path to FIRE (after a couple years of brainwashing ;D) and she has a similar budget. She just crossed over the $100k net worth milestone last week, so together we're right at $400k net worth.
* **Income:** I graduated college at age 22. First full-time job was making $55k. Now I make $82k at age 26. I'm a typical ""financial analyst/project manager"" for a Fortune 500. It's a pretty low-stress, 40 hour per week job, with 10-20% travel to support clients. If I had never negotiated twice for more money, I'd be at \~$68k right now instead of $82k. I'm still at the same company that I started at and not necessarily looking to change anytime soon. I really love my team, boss, work-life balance, and the work that I do. I also live less than 1 mile from my office, so I walk to work everyday.
* **Home:** We live in a lower-cost-of-living city in the south (not the crazy HCOL areas like NYC or SF). Our rent for the first two years out of college was $1,500 per month ($750 each) for a 1-bedroom apartment in the nicest area of the city (and walkable to my office). About 1.5 years ago we bought a 435 square-foot, 1-bedroom condo in the nicest part of the city for \~$125k. We did this as a way to maximize the efficiency of our monthly budget, not necessarily as a long-term investment. We plan on living here for at least the next 5 years (we want to have kids in our early 30s), then keep it as an investment property. After living here for 1.5 years we absolutely love it. It seems ""too good to be true"".
* **Monthly Budget:** $821
   * Mortgage/Property Taxes/HOA/Home Owners Insurance: $361 (my half)
   * Utilities: $50 (my half)
   * Phone: $24 (Republic Wireless 1 gb plan)
   * Internet: $25 (Google Fiber, my half)
   * Food/Dining/Groceries: $100 (my half. Since it has been a common question, take a look at my replies to several comments below to see a deeper explanation on how we only spend $200/month for 2 people. TLDR: Shop at Aldi and Kroger, always buy generic, eat out less than once per month, cook every meal, and bring lunches to work everyday).
   * Car Insurance: $61 (2004 Scion xB with 180k miles that I bought for $4k in 2015. This will go up because I want to start paying for umbrella insurance soon...)
   * Gas: $0 (I walk to work, rarely drive, and when I do, its normally for my job and I get my miles reimbursed).
   * Vacation: $100 (carries over if we don't use it)
   * Fun Money: $100 (my catch-all category if it doesn't fit in a category above: video games, concerts, movies, Amazon Prime, Netflix, extra vacation money if we go over, etc.)
* **Debt:** Our only debt is our $98k mortgage.
* **Net Worth:** $300k
   * I have 11k in cash in an Ally savings account, $251k in index funds with Vanguard ($124k in my 401k, $54k in my Roth IRA, and $73k in my taxable account), $38k in home equity.
      * Here's the Mint breakdown: [https://imgur.com/bFV0gEx](https://imgur.com/bFV0gEx)
   * Here's a Mint graph of my net worth over time (going back to my 2nd year of college when I first learned about the concept of FIRE from MMM): [https://imgur.com/GvsF7vM](https://imgur.com/GvsF7vM).
      * Age 20: $1k
      * Age 21: $20k
      * Age 22: $61k
      * Age 23: $84k
      * Age 24: $161k
      * Age 25: $213k
      * Age 26: $300k
* **Savings Rate:** My savings rate has been between 70-85% pretty much every year since college. I don't have an ultra-high income, but I do have pretty ultra-low expenses. My SO's savings rate is around 50-65% because her income is a little lower and expenses are a tad higher.
* **FIRE Goal:** $1.5-2.0 million. Right now our expenses are very low, but we expect them to rise in 5 years when we have kids and move into a larger house in a good school district. We hope to hit this amount by age 35-40, but we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
* **Post-FIRE Aspirations:** I've always dreamed of being a high school US History teacher. I'd like to at least try it once to see how I like it. Since I'm FIRE I could easily quit If I don't like it. I've also always dreamed of being some kind of not-for-profit financial adviser for the ""Average Joe"" American. More of a ""financial coach"" where I could help people everyday with the basics (budgeting, index investing, etc.). Never sell any products. Just share my story and try to inspire people to make positive change. And most of all, I want to be a great dad. One of the biggest drivers of our FIRE goal is to be very close to FIRE by the time we have kids in our early-mid 30s. I just want to be a part of my child's life every step of the way and just be ""there"" the way my parents were for me. And of course I have a ton of ""bucket list"" items that I'd love to try out (thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, thru-hike the John Muir Trail, thru-hike the Vermont Long Trail, summit Kilimanjaro, build a camper-van and road trip to all the National Parks again, etc.).
* **My Advantages:** Amazing parents who taught me the importance of education, frugality, and having a good head on my shoulders; a frugal & fulfilling childhood that showed me what's most important in life; being born in the U-S-of-A baby!; a full academic scholarship to college; a SO who shares my values and aggressive FIRE goals; the 2013-2019 bull market; supportive friends; learning about FIRE at such a young age; and many, many more things.
* **General Habits Worth Mentioning:**
   * I've maxxed out my 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA every year since starting work, plus invested the excess in a taxable account.
   * I've never invested in bitcoin or anything like that, just boring old Vanguard index funds. Vanguard is showing my personal rate of return since 2013 as exactly 10.0%, which is only slightly better than the S&P 500 during that time.
   * We love to travel. We go on 3-5 trips per year to National Parks, European cities, etc. that we fund via ""credit card travel hacking"" courtesy of /r/churning.
   * Unlike a lot of people on this sub, we've introduced the idea of FIRE to most of our close friends. Our parents, siblings, and close family also know our FIRE goals, but we set clear boundaries. My family is very understanding (my parents are basically FIRE-ing next year at age 53). Her family still thinks we're a little crazy. We're pretty open about our journey and try to help others if they are interested. Because of this, our 10-20 closest friends are all into FIRE as well. We hang out with friends 2-3 nights per week, but instead of ""going out for drinks"" (we don't drink alcohol anyways...) we go over to each other's homes for home-cooked dinners, board games, and video games. I say this because we have a good social network, but don't have to spend a ton. Having a like-minded SO and like-minded friends have been two of the most important contributors to my happiness and high savings rate.
   * Saving this much and maintaining a 70%+ savings rate hasn't been ""hard"" for me. I don't have to try very hard to accomplish these goals - it's just who I am. I'm a natural saver. Saving EXCITES me. I don't feel like I make any sacrifices in my life to meet these goals. I buy everything that I want...I just find that I don't ""want"" a lot of the typical things that other people ""want"" (luxury cars, eating out, 5-star hotels, brand-name clothes, $30k wedding, huge home, etc.).......And the best part is that I can't believe that I found a SO who is arguably more frugal that I am.

EDITS: 1) Added a little more explanation in the budget section about spendng $200/month on food for 2 people since that has been a recurring question. 2) Added a section on my post-FIRE aspirations since that was another question that people kept asking.

**TLDR: Hit $300k net worth at age 26. Frugal, middle-class upbringing. Got a full scholarship to top in-state university. Worked 2-3 jobs every week while attending college to pay for living expenses and saved the rest. Got degree in business. Graduated with no debt and $60k saved up. Parents gave me $10k as a graduation gift. Made $55k/year at my first full-time job after college. 4 years later I currently make $82k at the same company. My monthly budget is \~$820/month. I have been dating my SO for 9 years, living with her for 4 years, and I'm getting married to her in a couple months. She's dead-set on the FIRE path as well. #blessed**",financialindependence
329,I lost the love of my life because of FI. Don't be me,,3197,7qough,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7qough/i_lost_the_love_of_my_life_because_of_fi_dont_be/,1516066741.0,"I should be clear, it's because I obsessed over FI and ignored my life goals.

Together for 7 years, living together for most of it. She was perfect for me and was also very frugal. I had it all.

I read the stickied post. ""Find the live you want to live and save for it"", or whatever it's called. But I didn't take it to heart. I thought I was doing this. I didn't understand. I was so wrong. I was blind. I was living the life I wanted to but I was ignoring the life that my partner wanted.

I didn't spend money with her to do the things she really valued. I didn't buy plane tickets to go visit her family with her when she desperately wanted me to come. My whole life I said I wanted kids and then discovered FI and changed my mind because they were too expensive. I refused to buy nicer furniture for our apartment and made her embarrassed about our place and not comfortable in her own home. Over and over I made this mistake and we drifted apart. She wasn't asking for much, just for things she really valued. She is frugal. I was selfish. And I lost sight of the fact I always wanted kids.

I realize this all now but it's too late. I told her all of this but it's too late. Don't be me. Examine every facet of your life and think about it. I regret it all.

FI ruined my life, but it's my fault, not FIs fault. It was my obsession. So here's my advice. Focus on the life you want to live, but compromise with your partner too because I'd trade all the money in my bank for that relationship back. And once you are in the boring middle, get off this sub and go out and focus on what makes you and your family happy today.

Don't be me. Don't get obsessed. Live in the present.

Edit: thanks all for the well wishes. Unfortunately it's too little too late. My words are just words to her. Which I understand, I mean, actions speak and words don't. I take away from this a valuable life lesson and hopefully will be a better partner to my next partner. Harsh lessons lead to the best results. I laid my heart out for her and explained how I know what I did wrong and how I was going to fix it. Too little too late.

I made this post to help people and put things in perspective which I think I did. I'm glad I was able to remind people that it's ok to spend money on the things that make your partner happy.

And my FI is delayed actually because she made a great salary and we shared many expenses. Horribly ironic! 

Edit again:

Looks like I'm undeleted. I want to add that in any breakup it's due to a variety of reasons. I'm isolating this reason for the purpose of this subreddit because I know it had a material impact in driving her away. My selfishness to not think about my partner's true wants.

331,Can we take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to be financially literate?,,3162,ek22ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ek22ci/can_we_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_how_fortunate/,1578170134.0,"Everywhere else I look, besides this sub, I see people worrying about debt, complaining about cost of living, fighting for wage increases because they “don’t get paid enough to survive,” etc. And every time I look at the numbers they quote, I think to myself I make not much more than that and I live in a HCOL area and I was pulling a 70-80% savings rate before having a baby. Even now, when we can choose to coast, we are still pulling a 10% savings rate. 

And people get so defensive when I try to advise them on better financial decisions (e.g. living below their means). These situations used to enrage me but now I just feel sympathetic towards these financially illiterate people. If they refuse to make lifestyle changes and want to keep believing that they’re being under-compensated, they will never achieve FI, and they will never be happy.

TL;DR: we are a very fortunate people to have been educated in personal finance and to have a plan to achieve FI.

Have a great 2020, everyone!

Edit: To answer the questions about my savings rate numbers, here's what I did: When I was single, I lived with my parents rent-free (yes, I was very lucky to be able to do this). After I moved in with my wife, we pooled our money together and bought a modest 2-bedroom condo. We then rented out one room so the rent pays for a good chunk of the mortgage payment. We split the rest of the mortgage payment across the two of us. In addition, we cooked at home most of the time and we find free or very cheap entertainment. As a result, we could put away a huge chunk of our paychecks. After we were comfortable to just coast until retirement, we decided to have a baby. To our surprise, even with the baby's added expenses, we've still been able to contribute about 10% of our paychecks to our retirement accounts (401k, 403b). And no, we are not techies getting paid through the roof nor were we born into money. I was working two jobs and going to graduate school in my 20's (roughly minimum wage), and my wife and I are both currently being paid just under the median income in our region.

I sincerely apologize for sounding arrogant or condescending in my original post. That was not my intention. And yes, I do know some people go through hardships and do not have the capacity to save. I did not mean to call every poor person irresponsible. I was just feeling extremely grateful. Peace!",financialindependence

You know that people are going to think better of you if you have the fancy designation, the fancy car, the big house. But you choose to say – “Hey I don’t care what people think. I choose to NOT chase status. I’ll chase freedom and fulfillment instead”.

&#x200B;

What that does is it makes our journey lonely. We crave connect, we crave to be told we’re still valuable and important, we want people to tell us we are doing the right thing. So we come here onto this sub and talk to people like us.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately – this sub has slowly changed from a place where people came to seek connect, to a place where people come to seek validation. People have a void in their life from not being able to brag about their car, which they come here and fill by bragging about their income and net worth.

&#x200B;

So we have two kinds of posts, again and again with monotonous regularity: the first is the humblebrag (I have $2.8M and an income of 200K – can I retire?). This makes majority of the sub insecure and apologetic, and we have the second kind of post (I’m not an engineer in the Bay area – can I even think of retiring? I’m from a third world country – can I even dream of FIRE?)

&#x200B;

**We are the new Joneses**

&#x200B;

From being a powerful rejection of the status games that society plays – FIRE has become the ultimate status game. We now have incredibly intelligent, competitive people playing the game of “Who has the highest net worth”.

&#x200B;

We need to stop. We need to change. The sub no longer holds the values that made the FIRE path what it was. We no longer have that spirit of crazy rebellion, that heady feeling of freedom and power that comes with creating our own path.

&#x200B;

How do we change? I’m not sure. Maybe we refuse to state absolute numbers and net worth – phrasing everything in savings rate percentages or multiples of expenses saved. Maybe we recognize that the need to humblebrag is a natural human one, but restrict it to a daily thread.

I am very fortunate to be in the position I am in and definitely owe it to my parents who taught me strong personal finance values and paid for my education. 

Current assets: 

* Checking: $3,160
* Savings: $18,713 *- should I move this into an investment fund?*
* 401K: $32,376
* Roth IRA: $35,167
* Investment fund: $12,489

**Total: $101,905**

&#x200B;

**2018**

* January - Graduated college with a net worth of $20k, my parents paid for my college and I was lucky to not have student loans. I took extra classes to graduate a semester early in order to save my parents some money
* I was able to grow my net worth to $20k by graduation by always working throughout college. I went to school in a large city and worked year-round. On top of a full course load, I alternated between working for the school and completing external internships.
* I opened a Roth IRA my sophomore year and maxed it out annually. I remember thinking that once you put in money, it would just grow automatically... it took me over a year to realize I needed to actually invest the money. 
* August - moved to a HCOL city and started a job with $85k salary and $10k bonus. My rent was $1500. I have 3 roommates in a 2 bedroom apartment and my rent is considered pretty average for the location and space.

**2019**

* Throughout the year, I targeted a savings rate of \~40% (post-tax, pre-401k contribution). Being in a HCOL city, I was surprised that I was able to save so much while still feeling like I am able to enjoy my time with my friends and enjoy what the city has to offer.
* My work provides most of my weekday meals which greatly reduces my costs. However, I still cook on the weekends and would like to think that I would bring in at least half my lunches to work if it wasn't provided (may be wishful thinking)
* I religiously track my spending in excel and group my expenses into different buckets. I use these buckets to determine which credit cards are the most beneficial given my spending habits. I use credit card bonuses to pay for my vacation flights. 
* I also churn bank accounts and estimate an additional income of \~$2k from this.
* Being in a populous city also has the benefits of lots of app promotions and deals. I subscribe to lots of different websites/apps that offer discounts to activities and restaurants in the area, and I use these quite a bit. I try to regularly remind myself to only use the discounts on things that I would've done anyway, but I am curious if this one is actually saving me money or not.

**2020 and onwards**

* Received a bonus of $25k and salary bump to $100k, savings rate increased to \~55%
* I want to maintain my spending habits for the next 1-2 years. Although my living situation is not ideal and would really like to move to a no-roommate apartment, I anticipate potentially changing jobs soon. In the case I have to take a pay cut, I just want to make sure I don't lifestyle inflate too much just to deflate it later.
* Having an SO with a similarly frugal mindset helps a lot. We do a lot of stay-in cooking dinners and enjoy each other's companies just walking around the city and doing free activities.
* Although I realize I am very fortunate and have a high income level, I am still very proud to have saved this much. I try not to talk about finances too much with my friends, but I am consistently shocked at how little my peers are saving with similar income levels.",financialindependence

Quitting a job with status to be retired can be challenging. Status is a game we play in social interactions all the time. Since I retired, I notice this game most when meeting old friends.  They want to know what I have been doing since I left work. I feel slight internal pressure to have interesting things to tell them. 

Retiring from a 40+ hour/week can be challenging. The 40+ hour work week organized my life in so many small insidious ways. Every choice about how I spent my time/life was anchored in the week vs weekend and how long is PTO and how long will it take to get to my job in the morning. Giving that up leaves you in great jubilation (for months), but eventually I had to build some anchors into my day (morning ritual, exercise, long term projects and short term goal setting). 

I think for my siblings, these two barriers (status and time) are enough to keep them working no matter how much money they have banked. They will eventually quit work, but they may have a rough time.  The work to do before retirement is (1) learn how to feel good about one's self without the status of being a ""boss"". (2) Identify and pursue passions outside of work that will give wings to one's days when the 40 hour/week shackles have fallen away.",financialindependence

My goal isn't to retire at 60, and this doesn't factor in social security, but it's a huge relief to know at a minimum I should be able to retire at a ""normal"" age and not have to worry about retirement the way my parents do. I have the security to take a lower paying job in the future if I want, because I won't have to ""catch up"" just so I'm not required to work in my old age.

It's not the numbers some people are posting here, and I have a good job (military) that doesn't bring in the money some other posters do, but large savings are possible. I just wanted to share my milestone with people who may appreciate it, because I'm sure it would bring me some dirty looks from people at work who don't save as diligently.

EDIT: There's been a lot of comments about inflation. This is normalized in 2020 dollars. 10% historical equities growth minus 3% historical average inflation equals 7% real growth yearly.

Before I started, I would have guessed it would be between 5% to 10%. I was actually shocked how high it was. Nearly everyone I know has kids or planning to have kids.

Please know, this post is not anti-kids. I do like kids and have many lovely nieces and nephews, but for personal reasons I decided not to have my own. The decision was nothing to do with FIRE, but it did make it quicker to achieve.

This is my first post and first account after reading posts for months, I decided it was time to share my thoughts. We actually FIRE’d before we knew this was an actually thing!

&#x200B;

**Section 1: Our FIRE journey**

I met my husband at 30 (he was 31) and we had 2 years of dating, spending, travelling and going out 4-5 times a week.

**Age 30-32**, our joint take home pay was not massive and we had no family money. He is a journalist, I am an accountant.

* 42% went on mortgages (with modest over-payments) we already had our own one bedroom apartments.
* **58% went on “expenses / living / entertainment / stuff”.**

At 32 we eloped and got married. No friends. No family. No stress. No silly fights. Very romantic. That saved us so much, our FIRE journey had begun. Most of our friends were having the big fat wedding, buying a large house, 2 new cars and having 2 or 3 kids.

I squeezed into his small apartment and put tenants in my larger one. We also had a MAJOR life style change. Our nights out reduced, travelling nearly stopped, and buying “unnecessary things” totally stopped. We also did usual money saving things.

**Age 32 to 41**, from our net salaries and the one rental income

* 85% now went into repaying the two mortgages (with large over-payments).
* **15% for “expenses / living / entertainment / things”.**

**Dropping from 58% to 15%** was down to sharing one small property, economies of scale, the incoming rent, long hours and salary increases AND the major life style change. In our 20’s we were single (on and off), carefree, partied and travelled extensively. So we were now happy to be a boring married couple.

With both mortgages repaid at 36, the savings climbed quickly. We both did not really enjoy our jobs much due to the long hours and stress, so it was amazing to resign. FIRE at 41. We sold both properties and moved 180 miles where properties were much cheaper.

We both could still have work for more years and saved more money, but what is that saying: **“You do a job you hate, to buy things you don’t need, to impress people you don’t actually like”.**

We are now 48. For the last 7 years, very chilled and live a humble simple life. NW c$1.95m (Is that classed as Lean? Some of you guys have a huge net worth!)

&#x200B;

**Section 2: The “kids” vs. “no kids” debate and the 17.9%:**

Yes, our FIRE was achieved quicker by not having kids (joining the 17.9%), but FIRE was not the reason for the childless decision. On our first date, I don’t know how or why it came up, but we both said we did not want kids. We both had our personal reasons and difficult family histories.

The average statistics from random reports (see Note 1 and 2 below) covering the USA, Canada and UK:

* **80.1%** have children.
* **17.9%** are childless. (USA 17%, Canada 19.5% and UK 19%, see Note 1 below)
* **2.0%** cannot have children. (see Note 2 below)

It is not an exact science, due to timing, margins of error – so still very subjective. I guess out of the 17.9% there are women who actually wanted kids, but circumstances were against them.

**Bringing up one kid to age 17 can cost up to $390,000** – depending on your earnings / lifestyle (see Wikipedia “cost of raising a child, Note 3): Again – very subjective and no calculation for opportunity costs and all those expenses for a kids 18+ (university, weddings, boomerang kids, grandkids etc.)

FIRE is harder and takes longer with kids. We have huge respect for those who achieve FIRE with kids.

So it is down to you in the end. What do you want? There is no right way or wrong way! With or without kids. FIRE quick / slow / fat / lean. If you have a FIRE partner, it also helps if you are on the same page!

Good luck to those just starting out!

House is paid off, wife is still working full time, and I'm going to go on her health insurance for the time being. 

It's been a ride. I left my long-term position in Fortune 100 IT after 8 years, because they completely re-wrote my job description from SAN Engineer to Automation Coder. I suck at code, I hate coding, and I'm no good at learning it. Plus, the way they were handling the ""culture shift"" was... Out of touch.

So I did a 6-month contract, and hated it. It was obvious that they thought of contractors as ""the help"", despite it being a 20% pay raise from my last, generous job. You don't pay someone like that to publish email newsletters. 

Got my ""dream"" job, at the local university. Finally, no more long commute. Very ""The Monkey's Paw"" situation. I got what I asked for, in the worst way possible.

My starting annual salary was 34k in 2000. My highest annual salary was about 2 years ago, 110k. I live in a large American city. I have never worked very hard (office job, 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, or less). I have always invested in the stock market (even during the low-salaried years).

I bought and sold a house in Large American City for profit. I buy used cars exclusively, high miles ok (currently a sweet $6k convertible, bought 3 months ago).

People are writing to me asking for advice and encouragement, my main advice would be to automate your savings, the old ""pay yourself first"" strategy, preferably into stock index funds. My second advice would be not to buy dumb stuff, no ""keeping up with the Joneses"". My third advice would be not to buy new stuff, if it costs more than, say, $100, and it's not made with any kind of cloth or fabric. (That's right, leather seats in the cars...) My final advice would be to eliminate and reduce, as much as possible, the cost of your monthly bills. (When you buy a car with cash, there's no monthly payment.)",financialindependence

I had $2000 starting in 2017 with a networth of -$16500.

My finances were awful lots of credit card debt and no savings. After I solidified a Job working 48 hours a week making more than I did before I started saving aggressively to hit my goal of $0 networth by the end of 2018. I cant wait to start hitting more of my goals. 

More info:
I currently made $16 an hour as a supervisor at a restaurant making 250 in tips bi weekly for the most of 2017.

No one knows I’m in such a good spot. 3) Earning $400K + nice benefits, and I’m just gonna walk away? 4) College for my kids will be taken care of, but I’m not sure I could be so selfish as to spend down savings on wife and I, while kids might potentially start with little (just like I did, but... I admit that a huge part of feeling “successful” is that I can pay it forward to my kids as well as charitable causes close to my heart). ",financialindependence
344,The real costs of aging and impact on adult children planning for FIRE,,2824,kqwm36,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the_real_costs_of_aging_and_impact_on_adult/,1609845911.0,"I have been experiencing some of the hardest days of my life and wanted to reinforce that conventional FIRE planning does not do a great job of considering the challenges of old age and a child’s role in helping their parents. My fathers expenses have more than doubled since my mother died. He has a degenerative disease and has to pay for people to come to his house to help with things like making food and getting dressed. My FIRE budget certainly would not cover these kinds of expenses. In our area, its impossible to find reliable home aids who would be covered under Medicaid after he runs out of money (which will happen this year). So his only other option would be a nursing home. Until he is vaccinated, that is not an option. My family lives in a small home and we have lived a frugal lifestyle. I have no where to put him in my own home and he wouldn’t want to move here anyway. My expenses have also increased as I travel often to see my father and help in any way I can. For those who already live a conservative lifestyle, don’t fall into the trap of planning a retirement budget of 80-100% of your pre-retirement expenses. I am adjusting my approach and setting 150% as my new target. This is causing me to have to completely rewrite my plans. Most elderly people are not going for a walk in the park one day and dead the next. The process can be ugly, time consuming, and expensive. That mini-retirement I was planning may be spent as a caregiver for a parent. If you successfully apply the FIRE principles, people will know it and will come to you for help. Even if they don’t ask, you may feel compelled. Maybe not a parent, but someone close that you care about. Are you prepared for this?  (I wasn't)",financialindependence
345,BLACK MAN ON FIRE,,2812,gxz5g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gxz5g4/black_man_on_fire/,1591477924.0,"Before you ask, no this isn't Denzel Washington's burner account. I've lurked here long enough and with the pandemic, social unrest, and tropical storm all conspiring to keep me indoors I figured now was as good a time as any to contribute to the community. 

Background: Grew up disadvantaged. Mom institutionalized schizophrenic, dad had other priorities so grandparents took me in and literally saved my life at 9 months old. Neither could read or write very well but managed to own two homes(that I now own) and were small business owners(maid and landscaper). Dad lived on the other side of the state but paid for catholic school which helped me avoid some of the pitfalls associated with abject poverty: busing, overcrowded schools, overworked educators, etc. So let's just say that I started the FIRE race a bit further back than most and had to navigate a few obstacles along the way. 

Graduated high school with a whopping 2.38 GPA and an 1170(old scale) SAT score. I wanted to go to college but didn't have the pedigree to make it happen. Oh yeah, I was the president of my high school's computer science club. I wasn't dumb, just distracted. Long story short, I joined the Service to pursue an ROTC scholarship and with a bit of remedial work and a fair amount of institutional motivation(read threats and punishment) I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and started my professional life. 

The Plan: At this point in my life (early 90s), I had a gig and was making the most money I had ever made in my life: $18,795.60(before housing allowance). I was finally housing and food secure and at 23 I had transitioned from poverty to the middle class. The plan was to complete my service commitment and join my peers in industry. 

You all know about the best laid plans of mice and men. Four years became \~20 years and add a wife, two kids and a couple wars to the mix. Outwardly my life resembled the Jones'. We had a single family home in the burbs, two great kids at great schools, and a couple of almost paid for cars. But we were net worth poor. In the late 2000s I would return from my final deployment to 22K of credit card debt, a rental property that was upside down and not cash flowing, while living in a rental across the country that we couldn't afford.

 Side note: In the early 2000s I stumbled across a book called The Wealthy Barber, and although I knew nothing about personal finance let alone FI, I knew that my finances were a mess and that I was mentally and physically tired. Something had to give. 

The Plan 2.0: The gory details aren't as interesting as the outcome, but starting in the late 201Xs and over the period of about 12 months I retired from the Service, divorced my now-ex, and founded an IT consulting firm. I hasn't been easy, but over the last 10 years the firm has grown to 40 engineers with annual sales in the mid seven digits. I've heard every possible version of no and been told on several occasions, to include by my now ex-wife, that I would never make it as a small business owner. Failure only occurs after you stop trying. I've also started up a new company that is product oriented. I'm getting to learn all about manufacturing and production. For a software guy this is uncharted territory and exciting to say the least.

FI: YNAB tells me that I'm well on the path to financial independence. For you YNABers out there the age of my money is over 30 with a buffer over 100. For the non-YNABers, I live below my means. In practical terms, I'm debt free with about 4 years to go on my mortgage in a medium to low cost of living area. I have liquid assets over 1MM. I can almost go tell my boss to GFY(oh wait.. that won't work).

RE: Like many others here. I'm not certain what retirement looks like for me. I'm receiving my military pension now(high 5 figures), and absolutely love running my company. I work on average 3 hours a day from home with the bulk of that mentoring and leading the team. It's something that I enjoy and can do from anywhere in the world. I travel as much as I like and when I like. Life is good.

I'll humbly ask that this story be added to the collection of others like it. The magic of this community lies in the ability to be more open about finances. My neighbors and all of family members see me as the youngish, lucky, retired military guy. If they ever read that Tom Stanley book they might take a second look at this black man on fire.",financialindependence

My project's contract got delayed. The cheap people could hide on other projects. The expensive people (though not the managers, of course) had to take vacation.

349,"I went from -$28k to $72k NW in approx. 2 years, making less than 100k/yr.",,2786,js9m5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/js9m5b/i_went_from_28k_to_72k_nw_in_approx_2_years/,1605106845.0,"I would like to share my story. I want people to know you don't need to be a ""tech bro,"" or have a $100k/yr salary to start the journey to FIRE. I am a 24 y/o woman who came from almost nothing, and I am setting myself up for greatness. 


I didn't have the best home life growing up. I grew up in an impoverished area where 80% of people have no education beyond high school, my family included. A child of divorce. I have parents whose bodies broke down at a pretty young age. The works. I took some community college classes at 15. I moved out for university at 17 with some scholarships and lots of different jobs to keep me afloat.


At 20, I dropped out of university without a solid plan. I hated my major. I hated my research. I also struggled with a lot of health problems, including a brief period of (oral) chemotherapy. I rotated a bunch of little jobs and ran a small ebay business to pay bills. I eventually got into another school for a 3+1 program, but I had to wait until the next school year.


At 21, I was doing full-time unpaid clinical rotations and for a brief point, did not have a roof over my head. I slept in my car, crashed on couches, and relied almost exclusively on expired food from the sweets/bread truck from a guy at my site who drove bread trucks as a second job. The program before the rotation was HARD, but less impactful. 



I obtained a STEM degree on my 22nd birthday (yay!) with a -$28k NW. I quickly got my certification and started a career in healthcare with a pretty average salary, but almost unlimited potential for more money to be made. I work exclusively nights, weekends, and holidays. I have above average exposure to COVID-19. The job satisfaction is unreal- I can save lives without people ever knowing my name. The rock-solid job security doesn't hurt either.


At 22, I lived in an 80 sq foot room in a place with 5 loud roommates, 3 dogs, and a bird who lived on dayshift schedules. My sleep schedule was a wreck. However, I made it a goal of mine to not leave this place until I paid off every penny of my student loans and landlord, who was kind enough to waive my security deposit and provide basic furniture (she wasn't great in other aspects, however). I deprived myself of a lot, but I was able to pay off government loans before the end of the grace period and knocked out personal loans soon after. In addition, I created a rock solid emergency fund. Lastly, I contributed to the employer match in my 403b.



23 is boring. I started to contribute more to my 403(b), a teeny pension (I was an adjunct for a semester), and developed a Roth IRA. I got a place of my own to rent close to work. Same thing at 24, but Im trying to max my accounts out. After the market going up and down due to current events, I can say with confidence that my retirement funds reached and stayed at $50k. I could not be more proud.



Here are some stats. 

Career: Medical Laboratory Scientist

Location: Northeast, HCOL area

Base hourly (Fixed): $26.70/hr now, was $26.18/hr from Jan-Oct 2020

Bonuses/Differentials/Overtime (Variable): $20k-$30k/yr- differentials are the majority of this

Income from adjunct (2020 only): $1,920

Roth IRA, pension, and 403b as of 11/11/2020: $53,630.74

Additional things of value: I own my vehicle and have 6 months of living expenses in my emergency fund- about $18.5k total (using the KBB trade-in value to estimate the worth of my car)

Debt: $0

Expenses: $2.5k-$3k a month. This includes fixed expenses, variable expenses, and saving for my Roth IRA.

After tax savings rate is ~45% for 2020. Im not sure how much that raise will change this number.

FIRE goals: $70k/yr at 3.5%. Healthcare is expensive and I dont want to burden people with my long-term illnesses. I would love to transition to coastFIRE sometime in my 30s and let compound interest take over, if possible.

My future goals include: following my passion for art, mentoring young females in my family, finding a good life partner, having an easier work schedule, and FI

I'm about as stereotypical as it gets on this sub. 37M engineer, 15 year career doing R&D for a giant corporation. Wife worked for the first couple years, then was a SAHM for our 4 kids. I went to school on a scholarship but my parents gave me the money they had saved for my college anyway, so between that and the second income for a few years we had a huge headstart. We're both frugal by nature and have had a SR over 50% for my entire career. I've been borderline FI for quite a while, part-time for the last 3.5 years, since my youngest was born, but now I finally consider myself RE.

It was easier to tell people I'm going into teaching, so that's what I told people. I enjoy subbing and volunteering in the schools and I might even get a certificate, but for now I'm taking the summer off to camp, go backpacking, and catch up on the HoneyDo list. 

Wife still works one day a week and I do expect to have a little side income, but ignoring that the WR is a bit under 4%. We give a lot to charity, so I have some flexibility if the long-awaited crash actually materializes.

I turned in my badge less than an hour ago, so I'm still waiting for it to feel real. Maybe Monday morning it will finally kick in psychologically.

Anyway, it's a happy day. Thanks for letting me share:)

ETA: Lots of people asking about health insurance. That was the biggest concern. I'm in upstate NY, my kids will cost $27/mo total for CHP, and my wife and I will pay $800-$700=~$100/mo after Obamacare credits. Next year when I don't have 5 months of salary we'll qualify for an even cheaper plan.

ETA2: This is reaching outside the regulars of the sub. Google ""the shockingly simple math of early retirement"" and click the Mr money mustache link, and ""the ultimate guide to safe withdrawal rates"" and click the early retirement now link. Those two make a good primer for why what I'm doing might not be crazy.

ETA4: Several people have requested some numbers. I typed it all out, but I can't bring myself to post it, not sure why. Self-conscious, or feeling a need to justify/explain stuff, or something. Here's the best I can do (and even this is making me uncomfortable for some reason):

|---|---|---|---|
|2003|22|~$100k|Got married! Started working in 2004, wife was already working in 2003|
|2008|27|~$250k|By dumb luck we liquidated stocks to pay off our first mortgage, dodging some GFC, but still, that year was tough. I got ulcers. Stayed 80/20 for as much of the recovery as I could, but eventually (2011ish?) went to 60/40|
|2013|32|$620k|Started reading MMM around this time, and planning for FIRE. Went 65/35 around 2015ish|

I decided to pursue FI not so much for the RE but rather for the peace of mind and the psychological effect of knowing that I can retire whenever I want to.

When I paid off my mortgage my mind set at work shifted from working my butt off and trying to please everyone to working smart, putting in less hours and being vocal about alternatives to my manager.

In the past I would of put my head down, do what I was told and hope to get a good review at the end of the year.   Due to “work smart” mentality, I spent more of my companies money to hire qualified people at a high price so that they can make my life easy.

I then got the $1M mark and accelerated my “work smart” philosophy and pushed to spend way more money on quality hires.   My company is kind of cheap and this was a big deal especially since I was putting my neck out if it didn’t work, but I had $1M saved so psychologically I won’t be homeless if things went wrong.   So I kept on pushing.

Recently just had a meeting with the president of my fairly large company and they want to promote me due to my “strategic” mindset.  This new job pays more than double my current compensation and is going to be a life changing jump.

The best part is that I see my wife and kids every night for dinner and never work weekends anymore.   This is all because of you guys and having my FI give me the courage to catapult myself.

I continue to learn a lot by reading this subreddit daily and promise to not splurge on a bigger house, expensive cars, etc.   I hope to build more confidence at work and who knows maybe RE when I’m tired of working.

Cheers to all of you on your journey.",financialindependence
352,"Hit 300k NW. My story as a 27 y.o. female, immigrant, minority, and growing my income from 32k > 150k.",,2708,htlk4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/htlk4h/hit_300k_nw_my_story_as_a_27_yo_female_immigrant/,1595097224.0,"I’ve been reading this sub since 2015 and with the encouragement of my partner, finally decided to post. Throwaway so I can share #s and answer your questions.

Background: daughter of two immigrants, I was born outside the U.S. but raised here from a young age. My parents are some of the most disciplined and frugal people I’ve ever met - probably due to growing up poor in rural India. We were low income as I was growing up but my parents worked hard and are solidly middle class now. I got what I needed as a child but rarely anything more. 

College: Luckily I loved school and got good grades. Landed a generous scholarship and went to a small liberal arts school. Thinking I wanted to be a lawyer, I got the equivalent of a poli-sci degree. Graduated at 20 years old, and became the first person in my family to get a college degree. 

Post college: Had a crisis while taking the LSATs and applying to law school. Decided being a lawyer wasn’t going to be for me and withdrew my applications. 

So at 20, I had a network of 5k, a “useless degree” and no direction. This was the first time in my life I felt aimless, without school to guide me. But, thanks to my on-campus job in college, I had a few thousand dollars to my name. 

I had the realization that when your parents work manual labor jobs your whole life and haven’t gone to college, you don’t get a road map like other kids. I had no idea how the corporate world worked. But I was willing to work hard and learn, because that’s what I’d learned from my parents. 

Start of my career at 20 years old: 
- Left the suburbs where my family lived and moved to a HCOL city nearby. I got a job as a content writer at a startup paying 32k a year. 
- I was barely scraping by this time and without the help of my partner, I literally wouldn’t have been able to pay rent. 

Lucky break during this year at the start up: I discovered FIRE and realized how much it aligned with my values, and how much I was already living that lifestyle. My partner and I were already sharing a 500 square foot studio to save money.

From there, my goal became to grow my income and stay frugal (not that I had a choice with my income at this time lol). My partner was 100% on board and to this day, I consider that my luckiest break of all: I met someone whose financial values align with mine. 

Job changes and networth for the next 5 years: 

- Content writer (32k) &gt; contract role doing content (40k) &gt; got converted from contract to full time in marketing dept at the same company (53k). 

These two years were HARD. My budget was strict and had almost 0 discretionary spend. Still sharing the same studio apartment with my partner. But I worked hard to prove my value at work and saved every penny I could. Networth went from that initial 5k to 50k over two years, thanks to lots of stock market growth. 

- Left the company where I was making 52k &gt; to take a contract marketing type role at Microsoft (74k). This move was entirely to get the big name on my resume.

Thanks to four years of scraping by, STILL living in a studio apartment and a really strict budget, I broke 100k at the age of 24. 

Finally started to indulge a little in “fun” purchases like coffee shops and date nights. 

Early 2018:
- Started applying to content marketing roles at FANG companies. I had Microsoft on my resume and a better understanding of what non-tech roles existed at big tech companies.
- After 5 months of rejections, I landed a FANG job with a salary of 130k!! 
- Had to relocate to another state for the job
and it was now mid-2018, and my net worth was just about 150k. 

Moved into a 1-bedroom apartment for the first time. Expenses went up in my new VHCOL area but my salary increase offset that.

Been at the same company for 2+ years now and went from 130k to 150k in total comp thanks to two generous raises and working hard to be a “top performer.” 

Hit a net worth of 300k this week. Having a high income, spending less than 40k a year in a VHCOL area, a generous employer match, and the “trump rally” all contributed.

The last 7 years have felt like a whirlwind. I didn’t even learn English until I was 5 years old and now I’m working at a top tech company. 

The events of the last few months made me feel compelled to share my journey and maybe inspire other people on the FIRE journey who are minorities, don’t come from a secure background or are struggling through the corporate world. I feel INCREDIBLY fortune to be in this position. 

Anyways, thank you for letting me share my story with you all. Ask away if you have questions and I’ll do my best to answer throughout the day.

1 year ago I decided to quit a job that was essentially work from home or out of my private office downtown. It was literally the best job a person could have. (They made all kinds of weird exceptions to recruit me. It lead to resentment at the company and I would never suggest getting into that arrangement.)

The past year has been horrible for me. The lack of socialization, need to get out of the house and even impulsive urges such as drinking at home have taken their toll on me. This year long experiment is over. Hopefully I am still hire-able.

We will see. It will be fun to get back into the workforce for a bit. I'll be curious to see how it works out.

354,"Just because your path to FI/RE isn't straight and smooth, doesn't mean you shouldn't take that path. Here's my story:",,2698,j6x1y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j6x1y8/just_because_your_path_to_fire_isnt_straight_and/,1602097382.0,"Here on /r/financialindependence I read a lot of stories of many people's rather smooth transition from high school to a good college and into an immediately well paying career path that will set them up for life with little worry.  Some of us however have taken more unconventional paths.  

Here's a summarization of my adult working life:

Straight up - I was very unsuccessful financially for the first decade of my adult life.  

In college I was not a hard worker, most of my spare change went to beer, and a serious bout of depression almost flunked me out and took me several extra years to get my grades back up.  I had grown up with helicopter parents that severely limited my social life, so I viewed college as an escape from their grasp and as an excuse to have fun more than a way to get educated and set up my future.  I ended up barely graduated in 2011 with a degree that had been completely neutered by the 2008 financial crisis (Urban Planning).  I had worked intermittently in college during my breaks and also on an on-campus job and was able to pay cash for my first car (a used Toyota Corolla) that I still drive today.  Other than that, I was broke when I graduated.

I didn't get a job straight out of college.  I had an internship opportunity through a family friend that had been rescinded due to slashed budgets.  I had to move back home with my parents to a VLCOL small town where there was no work to be had; I couldn't even land a 3rd shift gas station attendant job.  After 10 months of unemployment and lots of boredom and depression, a chance encounter actually landed me an entry level job in my field: $11/hr conducting surveys for the local planning commission in a MCOL city; a far cry from the standard starting salary of $50k/yr that career path would have afforded me had I been just a few years older but hey, it was a job.

Over the next year I did everything I could to be as frugal as I possible: I lived in a friend's partially finished attic for $100/mo, I biked over driving every chance I could, grocery shopping was only done at Aldi and Walmart, I limited my recreational activities to free events and sports, and my only vacations were either to my parent's house or to visit my sister in another city two hours away.  I managed to save up $4000 that first year and opened up my first Roth IRA.  Very exciting!

The problem is that I realized that I hated my field of work.  The education I received didn't properly set me up to work in this new post-2008 financial and political world.  I didn't like the prospects of my future career, the culture of the workforce, and the fact that our work was continuously blown up by politicians routinely making poor decisions.  I realized that my dream of making utopian cities would never come true.  I grew to hate the city I lived in and the people I interacted with.  I needed a change.

In late 2013 I quit my job on a Friday and by Monday I had packed my car and was off to a new VHCOL city to start over with $3500 in my pocket and no job prospects.  A friend there had offered to let me sleep on the couch and I took him up on it.  Would I ever recommend anyone does this?  No, but in a way I was desperate and still pretty young so I chanced it.  Unfortunately, this VHCOL city also had almost no job prospects in my field, and for the next year I desperately applied to every job I could while taking little side jobs here and there to generate some cash flow.  

By October of 2014, I once again was broke.  Here I was, 26 years old, college educated, and I was sleeping on a couch with no money, no job, no girlfriend, no prospects in life, etc.  I hadn't contributed to my Roth IRA at all in the past two years.  My parents sent me $400 to get gas and an oil change so I could move back home.  The local factory had picked up and they had job openings; my future as a assembly line worker was being solidified.  

On a stroke of sheer luck, I found my drunk neighbor outside one night; he had lost his keys at a bar and was locked out of his home.  I called for a locksmith to come, and I stayed with my neighbor while he waited.  We got to talking and I told him the story I just told above.  He very drunkenly took sympathy and offered me a temporary job in the warehouse he managed for $10/hr.  He was clear that the work would suck and many people didn't last long, but I didn't care.  I was elated and took him up on it immediately.

I busted my ass for the next month working every moment I could and saving every penny.  The company liked me so much that they decided to keep me around. 
 Within two months I was off the couch and was moving in with a friend....into his sunroom.  But it wasn't the couch and it was only $250/mo!  I was able to open up a new bank account with $1000.  I was going places!

The next several years were still tough: I only received small increases in pay, I was passed over for promotions by other more well connected people, and I was still living quite literally in a closet.  Through overtime I was barely crossing the $30k per year mark.  And hanging over all of this was that I was still living in a VHCOL city, so that income did not take me very far.

At the beginning of 2017, the promotion finally came.  My income increased 50% and I was able to move out of the closet and into my own bedroom.  I was able to now start saving money at a good tick.  The problem was that I was so scared of returning to my old financial situation that I kept all of my money in cash.  2008 and all that it did to me and others still scared the fuck out of me.  I had worked so hard for that cash and I was not going to lose it.

2018 comes and my pay increased another 25%, and then that summer I decided to log in to my Vanguard account for the first time in years.  What I found was that I had totally forgotten to invest that $4000 that I had deposited in 2012 and had been sitting in a settlement fund.  The growth over the years meant that that $4000 had turned into $11000, which is great, but I did some calculations and found that had I put it in VTSAX, it would have become ~ $30,000.  I was pissed!

From that day forward, I have been very focused about saving and investing my money.  I found a pretty cheap little apartment for my area ($1000/mo with all utilities included) and I save about 50% of my take home earnings.  Last year (2019) I crossed the $70k income threshold for the first time and I payed off the last of my student loans.  My emergency fund grew to be big enough to cover a full year of expenses which has removed a ton of stress.  I have a separate CD fund set up that will allow me to buy a car either for cash or with the help of a small loan once my trusty Corolla finally dies.  I have been very lucky through the pandemic and have not only maintained my employment but also picked up a side gig.  I expect to cross at least the $85k income threshold this year (2020).  It's still not a ton of money living in a VHCOL city, but I've found little ways to stretch my money further than it should.  Purchasing a home is nowhere in my near future unfortunately, but that's just the way it is right now when the cheapest housing unit of any kind for sale is +$600K.

But what I'm most proud of financially is that for the first time in my life I recently crossed the $100,000 net worth level at the age of 32.  It's hard to believe how far I've come in the last 5 or 6 years from when I was straight up broke.  Index funds are absolute wonders!  At my current pace I expect to become a millionaire by the time I'm 43.  I've faced a lot of failures both internal and external so the prospect of this to me is elating.  I took risks that few would advise, and was willing to take on jobs that many would consider beneath themselves.

I share my experiences because I'm sure like many others I see the stories posted here about the full scholarship magna cum laude software developer that immediately gets a job at Google and will be able to retire at 35 and this can be very discouraging for us more ""average"" folk.  The path isn't easy for most of us, but it is worth it.  Luck can and does play a big role for us all; don't try to hide or avoid it, just embrace it and take advantage of the opportunities that come your way.  I don't know if I will ever fully achieve the Retirement Early part of FIRE, but I am damn proud that I can see the Financial Independence part in my future.",financialindependence

Backstory:

Started my career in the beginning of 2011 at 22 years old with $9k that I had saved up from working part-time jobs throughout high school/college. My parents supported me financially through college, so that obviously put me at a great place to start out independently upon graduation.

First couple years out of college I made good money and had a lot of fun, but spent a bit more than I was comfortable with (lots of unnecessary eating out, drinking, etc.). I got more serious about the FI mindset in 2014 and split rent with roommates at a cheaper place, so was really able to rein in my spending. Basically continued this for the next few years while slowly earning more and more.

I've always been a fairly frugal person. I'm the guy who never gets sodas at restaurants and only adds guac at Chipotle for special occasions. I track my expenses in Mint religiously. 

I've always pushed a lot of my money into investments (pretax as much as possible, taxable for the rest). It's easy to look back now and say that's a no-brainer, but you can pretty much pick any point in time over the last 8 years and find reasons why people though the markets were overpriced and going to crash. No different than today. Stay the course, it works.

In 2017 I got a new job at a higher position in a large company.  I also discovered that I now had a strong enough skill set that I could do some work on the side as a freelancer.

In 2018 I was lucky to be connected to a few more clients and took on more freelance work. This growth continued in 2019 as I built a stronger freelance portfolio and found more clients. Between my ""day job"" and freelancing I am putting in a huge amount of hours weekly, but I enjoy the freelance work, I like my clients, and it's a lot more productive than sitting around and watching Netflix all the time (which is what I used to do).

In the future, I hope to keep the traction that I've got going in my freelance work, and maybe turn it into a full business. I like my day job, but 9-5 M-F is just not my cup of tea (not to mention the drag of corporate bureaucracy and politics). I have relaxed a little bit to enjoy some lifestyle creep. No longer stress about adding guac for $2, not worried about overpaying for a trendy drink if I'm spending time with friends. I can feel my ""value"" shifting to being focused on ""time"" rather than on ""dollars"" and it's awesome.

**TLDR: Set your plan, stay the course. Be open to opportunities to make more money (by switching jobs or side gigs). Keep your spending in check as best you can.**",financialindependence

Landed my first job in entertainment at 24 as a PA making $450/week and have been slowly working my way up over the last 6 years to junior Producer level. Living in a HCOL (LA), it was always tough to save on such low salaries working project to project but I checked mint last night after I got my paycheck deposited and I saw the number.

Having followed this sub for awhile and working my ass off to save and pay off debt, it feels good to finally be on the right side of the zero. Looking forward to that FI some day. Baby steps.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and for the generous soul who gilded this! To go into a bit of detail since people are asking, here's how I did it:

First off, I am not completely out of debt. I still have payments left on the student loan, but I was able to refinance through my universities credit union and got a phenomenal rate so I've slowed down on paying it off (still pay more than the minimum each month). In lieu of aggressively paying it off, I've maxed out my Roth IRA for the last 4 calendar years since the market has been so hot, and that has made me a decent return. I put about $100/week into my savings account for my e-fund and use programs like Acorn to invest with money thats automatically rounded up purchases to the nearest dollar.

I had one $25k loan that I HAD to pay off in five years through USAA (I got the loan as part of another program I was involved with in college). That disciplined me from the start. I knew I had very little spending money so the only entertainment subscription I had was Netflix and internet. I ate very meagerly, cooked most of my meals at home (though work tends to pick up lunch quite often), picked up hobbies that didn't cost me too much money (like running and hiking). Over the course of the 6 years, I went from about $23k per year to $100k per year through promotions and different projects. I'm frugal. I don't spend money on shopping or clothing outside the essentials. I drive a 2008 Nissan Sentra thats fully paid off. My commute the past few years has been very short, saving a lot of money on gas. I lived with 2 other roommates for 4 years before moving to my own place, getting a killer deal on rent. I have no kids or significant other.

I try to keep a mindset of not ""how much I have"" but ""how much I have left"". That helps me keep a tight budget and not spend extravagantly. I know that I could have saved a lot more over the last several years, but as I made more money, I treated myself a little more to things like travel and electronics. Overall, I'm very comfortable with where I'm at and these past 2 years have allowed me to aggressively save more than I have in the past. I am so excited for what the future will bring. If I can do it as someone who has a degree in theatre, I know others can too!",financialindependence

I was surprised at how many people came up to me at work when they found out I wasn't leaving for another job, curious about how I'm doing it, asking how did we come to that decision, telling me how miserable they are and wish they could do the same...I think I made more than a few converts today!

Edit: Some requests for details so here goes. Guesses below are wrong - not real estate or tech. and Im in the boston area not SF. (BTW i didnt count the house in my numbers, to me it doesnt help unless/until we sell). Went to med school, practiced for a while, got burnt out, got a job in pharma, turns out was pretty good at it. But grew to hate the corporate BS, the commute, and wanted to spend my time the way I want to spend it. We didnt live like paupers, but were relatively frugal and saved our asses off -- \~75% post-tax. Put every extra dollar towards the mortgage, the kids college funds , and retirement. We did not, and I cant emphasize this enough, worry at all about keeping up with the Joneses. We have the smallest house out of everyone we know, a normal kitchen with normal appliances, we buy our cars with cash and drive them into the ground, no summer home in the cape (I know this sounds crazy but a vacation home is like a standard thing around here). When i got a bonus, it all went to house or savings. 

&#x200B;

I tracked our spending every month on a homemade spreadsheet, not to the penny, but the general categories. Didnt have a budget, per se, but I kept an eye on things, and like i said we werent big spenders anyway so didnt have a need to put controls on ourselves. 

Also tracked my investments monthly, and after some early attempts at ""diversification"" eventually wised up and put everything into S&P500 index funds (except for a small portion into a  tax-free bond fund).  Took advantage of everything my company offered: ESPP, 401K match, deferrred comp, etc. Eventually it reached a number i liked, and some events at work made me decide the time was right.",financialindependence
358,Am couple years away from 40. Time for some reflection and asking for advice.,,2646,bsxrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bsxrat/am_couple_years_away_from_40_time_for_some/,1558808837.0,"TLDR: just some thoughts as I reflect on my 20s and 30s. Lessons learned and mistakes I made. Maybe it helps those younger than me. In the end I ask for advice from those older than me.

&#x200B;

**Lessons I've learned to help those in their 20s and 30s:**

* Wish I had invested earlier. I invested in a big way starting in 2011+. Big mistake. Should have been investing every dollar that was just sitting in a savings account earning 0.05% (yep - did not have online savings accounts back then, and I didn't understand CDs etc.).
* Diet and Health. Incredibly important. NOTHING is worth a damn without health. Don't abuse sugars, carbs, meat - get a balanced thing that works for you. Get a ""good"" amount of sleep (I'm targeting 7 these days...usually average 5-6). Get an exercise routine that you can make a habit out of and that brings you some joy.
* Focus on skill maximization in 20s and 30s.  I worked *very* hard. Obnoxious hours every day. Was working for ""the man"" the whole time, and I focused on making myself more valuable and the company more successful. Figured I'd get my fair share over the ""long term"". The trade off was little to no fun travel, almost no social life, family relationships withered. Yes - the trade-offs were real for me and I was making them consciously. The millennials that I see around my company are doing it SO MUCH BETTER. The younger crowd seems to be doing an awesome job of balancing travel, family, and fearlessly negotiating higher wages. So...I guess I don't have much advice here. If anything, I see the younger folks that are investing in their skills and *giving the impression* that they are focused on organizational success get better promotion odds and leverage in negotiating better pay, benefits, etc.  I see those that are creating startups being successful too. Based on the cases I know of, the success-rate is better after a few solid years in a related career.
* Take your time and choose the right partner. Pretty self-explanatory. Don't get caught in the ""I won't find anyone better"" BS mindset and it shouldn't feel like settling. Looks are not that important - being on the same page with important things like finances, family, kindness, sexual chemistry (not same thing as looks) etc. - are far more important.
* Market timing and security selection...are impossible. If you think you know how to do it, take my money and escrow-guarantee me a return above market. If not, STFU. If I sound bitter, I am. Spent too much time chasing that rainbow. Now it's SCHB4Life (or similar). I still have a play-money account where I pick stocks that I am trying to get below 5% of my invested funds. I'm not perfect and like many others, will constantly have to work on fighting urges to ""do something"".
* Check your 401k fees. Do NOT PAY ANYTHING OVER **0.15%**. Move your funds to the lowest fee, broad-market index fund available with your 401k provider. You will save MILLIONS in compounded fees (remember, the loss isn't just the fees you pay today, it's the compounded returns you miss out on if you had saved on the fees and kept that money invested).
* Happiness/Purpose/Meaning. This is not a destination...no achievement unlocked is going to change your base-level of feeling good about yourself and your life. You have to work through your feelings of emptiness, lack of purpose, weariness with all the bad news you consume with your digital hoses - and *create* your own meaning and happiness. No, you are not alone in thinking that this world is shit and unfair. Tragic things happen everyday for no fucking reason. The universe doesn't give two leptons about your ambitions and dreams. Only you do - and while the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you, you can *create* your own meaning and purpose (good start is focusing on the things you love).
* Your only 'race' is with yourself. It matters not where you get, but how far you go with the resources & opportunities available to you. I've struggled with feelings of failure when those around me think I am ""successful"". It's because I know I can contribute more to the world with my skills, intelligence, and ambition. Contrary to popular opinion, I think people have *different* potentials - and you are in the best position of knowing what yours is at different points in your life. Take steps to realize your potential and you will feel great, and forget about anyone else's journey (whether they are ahead of you or behind you). The worst thing you can do is try and live somebody else's life (it won't bring you joy, and you won't discover the life that would have).
* I have chased financial security ever since I was 14. I was surprised by my feelings after I GOT EVERYTHING. There was an initial euphoria and release of stress, but then this sort of temporary malaise became a visitor. I have my dream car, wonderful wife, beautiful paid-off house, financial independence, at the top of my profession. Almost like a ""survivor's guilt"", I feel bad for family members and others stuck in bad situations...and sometimes feel like I don't deserve the good fortune I enjoy. The feelings are temporary, I quickly move on to something I do enjoy - but I recognize that they are there. This is just a continuation of the earlier point that ""getting everything"" is not the same thing as being happy. Happiness comes from progress. You always need to be making progress *towards* something, improving yourself in some way that holds meaning for you. Whether it be financially, relationships, intellectually, physically, etc. Progress is the only pill that helps. I think I learned this trick wayyy too late.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text. Was interesting for me to write on a weekend morning, maybe helps someone out there. Happy to answer any questions. My situation: single income, married, no kids yet but planning on one within a year.

Am all ears for advice from those in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond. Any words of wisdom? I think the older I get, the more I regard advice from those older than me. In my teens and 20s - I thought people in their 50s knew jackshit against the backdrop of a fast-changing world. Yeah...I was wrong.

It seemed to have a lot of responses and that's how I felt/feel so I thought I would share my recent ""revelations.""  

I write this as a word of caution and as a learning experience. My name is MrLlamaSC, and I'm a save-aholic.  



About 3 1/2 years ago I graduated college and moved into the typical software engineer position in a low cost of living city like so many others here. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't 100% in love with IT work, but I knew saving money to retire early sounded like a wonderful idea so I started down that path. I maxed my IRA, 401K, HSA, and opened up a taxable account for additional savings. My expenses had always been pretty low (paid off used car, cheap rent, not materialistic, etc) but I had read about lifestyle creep and what not so I really made sure to avoid that and maintained around a 75% savings rate.  

After about 8-9 months, I met up with a girl I had dated a couple of years prior, and we started dating again. She was absolutely lovely, was a pretty good saver herself, and had an amazing job bringing home more than me. I ended up teaching her a lot about finances and helped show her how she could pay off her loans quickly so we could start building towards a future to retire early and then live life doing whatever we wanted to do.  

She worked a lot of extra hours to make more money to pay off her loans, and I ended up picking up a side hustle (streaming) just for fun that ended up working out to make a decent amount of money. And of course, the more time/energy I put into streaming and the more time she put into working extra shifts, the more money we made; So that's what we did.  

Her goals were more focused around loans and a house, while my goals were more focused around retirement, but regardless both of us had savings goals and I thought things were going really well. Then after 2.5 years of dating, she broke up with me and I had to evaluate my life and I found the following things:  

1. We didn't have many experiences together considering how long we dated. I would sit in my chair and daydream about one day when we were retired traveling to Japan for a month or taking a cruise to the Bahamas or whatever, but often those things didn't happen. Additionally, a lot of smaller experiences never happened because it was always cheaper/easier to just stay at home and watch TV than go out to the bars with friends. Don't get me wrong, we didn't do NOTHING, but there was definitely less activities out because there was a focus on saving money.  

2. I wasn't living a happy/healthy life myself. I worked 176 hours a month, streamed another 120-140, tried talking to her every night, threw in random workouts, etc. All in all I only slept on average 4 hours a night and that exhausted me to where I had no energy for anything else including keeping my apartment clean, cooking food, taking her out dancing, etc. This played a big piece into the lack of experiences as well. I was making great money, but there was a cost to it and that cost was my relationship and my life. 

3. My mood about work and other things had become a lot more negative. I simply didn't have the energy to care and it for sure affected my performance and happiness. Every day I sat at work thinking about how quickly I couldn't wait to retire and be done with it and how much better life would be in the future. Any free time outside of work I did get I just wanted to try and nap.  

What's amazing to me though is how I NEVER realized this until she broke up with me. I had focused so hard on my retirement goal that I almost based my life success on how well I was doing on getting to that. I was seeing my investments and bank account grow and I got so focused on the potential future that I stopped living in the present. Not only is this not attractive/fair to my partner, but it didn't grow me as a human being either. I never realized (until the break up) that if I'm miserable during the accumulation phase, I'm still going to be miserable afterwards. Because having 100K, 200K 500K, 1M means nothing if you aren't happy and not doing stuff you love/being with people you love.    

FI is super exciting to learn about and pursue but after you get everything setup all you do is wait and then continue waiting. That waiting is your life and during that time is when you need to find out who you are and what you enjoy. During that time you need to figure out life that you want and then adjust your savings/goals to meet it. Live your life like you're FI but just in smaller ways (weekends, holidays, after work) and see what parts you enjoy and what you can live without.  

I look back at the past few years of my life and at my bank account and I would gladly give away a hefty chunk of it and work longer if it meant I could have experienced more of the world and found more passions I could have for the rest of my life, especially with someone I had loved so much. I built my savings, but I never built my life.  

What I found has helped me start down the changed path is simply 2 things:

1. Ask yourself questions and answer them. Without thinking about money or access or whatever, find out the things you enjoy in your life. Do you like renting an apartment, or would you rather have a house? What challenges do you enjoy in life? Who do you look up to? Etc.  

2. Be open to new experiences, and allow yourself a decent budget for these. For my budget I went more extreme as catch up for the past few years so I'm allowing my friends to choose new experiences for us to share from things like climbing mountains in Canada and scuba diving in Hawaii to free/cheap things like driving to the Grand Canyon and spending a day geocaching around the city. Sure this is going to knock my savings rate down a little bit, but it is going to build my life up tremendously so that one day when I do retire I'll have somewhere to retire to instead of somewhere to retire from.  

By doing this I'm not only improving my life and happiness now, but I'm shaping a life for my future and actually starting to see goals beyond ""save $X and retire in year YYYY.""  


FI is amazing and we are so fortunate to even have the chance to attain it, but don't lose sight of your life. Make decisions that aren't just financially right, but also emotionally, mentally, and spiritually right for you as well.  

Build the life you want, then save for it.

360,I have achieved poverty FIRE.,,2635,bggyur,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bggyur/i_have_achieved_poverty_fire/,1556029400.0,"In 2018 the US the poverty level for a single individual was $12,140. With a 4% SWR that means if you have $303,500 in savings/investments then you're essentially set to live the rest of your life at the poverty level. 

I do not think it's realistic for anyone to actually ""poverty FIRE"" as you're very much at the mercy of the markets at that point and living at the poverty level can't be very fun. But I think it does make for an interesting ""milestone"" to reach/aim for. 

I'm not interested in providing specific numbers or details about myself because I thought of this as more of a discussion than an actual brag post. 

So has anyone else reached this milestone without realizing it?

361,My Story: Reaching $250K Net Worth as 27 year old Black Gay Male,,2630,i9x3r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i9x3r5/my_story_reaching_250k_net_worth_as_27_year_old/,1597448757.0,"As of today’s market close, I surpassed 250K net worth. It’s been an arduous journey filled with a lot of suboptimal decisions made along the way but I’m very excited and blessed to have achieved such a pivotal milestone.  I believe my story is worthwhile sharing and my ultimate goal behind this write-up is to add to the existing collection of stories shared here that detail how FIRE can be achieved despite one’s background or demographic.

**Trials and Tribulations**  
I grew up in a VHCOL location in a single parent household as my dad died when I was very young. This certainly had an impact on the financial stability of the household. Growing up, my mom leveraged many of the welfare programs such as food stamps and section 8 to help stay afloat. Unfortunately, my mom didn’t finish high school nor go to college. So not only was she a single parent, but a single parent with limited employment prospects and low income potential. All of this, coupled with a lack of financial literacy, resulted in my mom living paycheck-to-paycheck as she struggled to make ends meet.

**The Inflection Point**  
Growing up, my mom was determined that neither me nor my siblings would replicate her path. She is a shining example of a parent who wants the best for their kids and for their kids to live a better life than they did. From young, my mother always emphasized the importance of education and aspiring to greatness. I am eternally thankful to my mom for guiding me through my childhood and keeping me on the right path. My mom never had to beat these concepts into my head nor stay on top of me — I just “got it” very early on. I made good marks throughout primary and secondary school; got into my dream school on a full ride scholarship, where I continued to make good marks, and became the first person in my family to go to — and graduate from — college (a Top 10 Liberal Arts college); and hustled my ass off senior year of college to ensure that I had a full-time job lined up after graduation. 

**The Journey**  
Before getting into my career details, I want to first acknowledge the fortune I had of graduating in 2014 — a time where the economy was healthily growing and long removed from the Great Recession and where the job market was bustling. These two factors certainly played a huge role in my ability to secure a job during the spring of senior year of college. I started my career at 22 where I worked at a small analytics firm. I had a quantitative major in college so that aided in me securing an entry level role at this analytics firm (shocking, I know). I had a decent time where I stayed for \~4 years and was promoted several times. After losing interest, I hopped jobs twice more before landing at my current company where I work in a hybrid analytics and consulting role. I truly enjoy my current role much more than any of my previous roles. However, the most jarring lesson in my career movement is how much my compensation has grown with external moves. At the end of my final year at my first company I made \~$96k. At my second employer I made $115k. At my current employer, I’ve made \~$180k so far (annualized) — and I still have one more bonus due before year’s end which will push me to about $190k-$195k total compensation. I would have ***never*** gotten this far this fast had I been at my first or second employer. I’m aspiring to break through $200k compensation next year, which should be achievable if the economy doesn’t crumble again.

**Current Financial Situation**  
As mentioned in the title, [my current net worth is $250K](https://imgur.com/p1XxQ9y). Since the start of my career I’ve been living at home, so that definitely has played a major role in my ability to save aggressively while living in a VHCOL. Here’s some context behind my net worth:

* 401ks are in a mix of VFIAX and VIIIX; the rest of my net worth is in VTSAX
* 100% of my Roth 401k is funded via Mega Backdoor (no direct contributions)
* [I didn’t start investing in my taxable brokerage or maxing out my 401k, IRA, and HSA until 2019](https://imgur.com/jBSgu2x)
* Net worth composition: 47% taxable; 30% tax-deferred (traditional 401k); 22% tax free (Roth 401k/IRA, HSA); <1% risk stock (triple-leveraged ETFs)

**Mistakes Made**  
Firstly, I didn’t start investing (excl. 401k) until 2019 despite starting my career in 2014. In the early stages of my career, I was primarily saving cash as my goal at the time was to save for a down payment for a house for my late twenties/early thirties. In hindsight, even with that goal, I should’ve still been active in the stock market as my time horizon was far enough out (8+ years). Between June 2014 and February 2019 — the time I was out of the market — [the S&P500 grew \~46% with dividends reinvested and accounting for inflation](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/). As I didn’t start investing until March 2019, I missed out on some decent gains. My portfolio would probably be $100k higher (give or take) had I been in the market consistently since 2014.

Secondly, I didn’t max out my 401k, IRA, and HSA until 2019. Looking back at [my salary history](https://imgur.com/vAap6l3), I could’ve been maxing these accounts out as early as 2015. But because I was so laser focused on saving for a down payment and lacked financial literacy, I ignorantly chose to heavy up on cash. This suboptimal move costed me thousands of dollars in lost tax savings. The only silver lining in all of this is that nearly half of my portfolio is in a taxable brokerage account — so that means I can easily access funds without having to entertain roundabout ways to access my money (e.g. 72t, conversion ladders).

**Things that Didn’t Prove True for Me**  
From youth to adulthood, I’ve been regularly told (e.g. family, the media) that “as a black man, you (will) have to work twice as hard in life.” But when I reflect on my life-to-date, I never felt this way. I just always knew I had to work hard, period. It was never a matter of working 2x or 3x as hard to achieve success. Early on, my mom instilled in me the confidence that if I dreamed big and worked hard, then I could achieve my goals. I have proved — and continue to prove — this to myself time and time again. Objectively, I can say that neither my race nor sexuality have been impediments to my success and ability to achieve at any point in my life. My drive, vision, and motivation have always been, and will continue to be, the basis of my achievements.

**Future Goals**  
I do NOT want to retire too early — I’m eying 55 as I truly do enjoy what I do work work and feel like I have a few more decades left in me, but also not trying to work into my late 50s or 60s. Short-term, I’m looking to hit $500K net worth by 30. I acknowledge that this is super aggressive but if things go business as usual (e.g. the stock market doesn’t go to shit) and my income remains at the level it is now, I’m confident that I can hit this target. Long-term, I’m targeting $5M-$10M net worth by 55. I acknowledge that this net worth target is aggressive and probably puts me more into baby fatFIRE territory. The two main reasons behind this aggressive target are (1) I want to live an extremely comfortable life in my retirement and don’t want to feel restricted and (2) I’m at the forefront of creating generational wealth for my family, which is currently nonexistent. I want to be able to leave millions (ideally) to my future kids (if I decide to have kids) or to my siblings and/or their kids. I want to keep the train running and I don’t want it to stop with me. 

Aside from myself, I’m looking to set my youngest sibling up for success early on. I’ve opened a 529 account currently set up for $1,200/year contributions for the next 5-7 years. Again, if the market acts business as usual, this should put the account somewhere in the ball park of $10k, give or take (unfortunately, I know this is just a drop in the bucket relative to how much more expensive college will be 5-10 years from now *sigh*). Additionally, I want to contribute to the youth — particularly black youth. Growing up in predominantly black, low income neighborhoods and now having “made it,” I know that I wasn’t the only black kid with a hard upbringing and a dream for a better life. There are many black youth out there who are smart, talented, and more than capable but just don’t have the resources or opportunities to optimize their success. There are two organizations in particular that align with this passion of mine that I have been involved in over the last decade through acts of volunteering, mentorship, and donations. I aspire to continue this for the rest of my life and leave a hefty portion of my net worth to these organizations upon my passing.

**Realizations**  
As I end, I want to share some foundational realizations I’ve made over the years, and especially more recently:

* This journey isn’t a competition, thus I don’t have any competition. I often see comments like “you’re doing better than X% of the USA, the world, or your demographic” and they mean absolute nothing to me. My goals are *my* goals — they’re not impacted or influenced by others, regardless if I’m at the bottom or top of the pack for my demographic. I have a higher net worth than some 27 year olds and some 27 year olds have a higher net worth than me — either way, who cares? I’m not going to change my strategy or alter my confidence because I’m outpacing someone or someone is outpacing me.
* By the end of my life I would have made it through the lower, middle, and upper class: I’ve spent most of my life (\~80%) in poverty/lower class, currently middle class, and will end up upper class in a few years. Having a lived experience across all three classes is something that I imagine will end up strengthening my empathy, awareness, and compassion.
* America is truly the land of opportunity. While America is not perfect (no country is), I sincerely appreciate America for the opportunities it has provided me to elevate and make something of my life. It amazes me how starkly I’ve been able to turn my life around from youth to present. I appreciate this country deeply.
* While I worked hard, lived with intention, and had a vision to get where I’m at today, I 100% acknowledge that external factors (e.g. graduating during an economic expansion and not a recession, currently working at a company that hasn’t made layoffs, etc.) played a pivotal role in my success as well. I think of success as a pie chart: while one slice of the pie chart may account for a large percentage of the pie (e.g. work ethic), there are still multiple slices that make up the rest of the pie chart: dreams, visions, support system, timing, college, network, luck, etc.",financialindependence

364,"My experience buying, owning, managing, and selling a single family home rental property",,2575,eotkx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eotkx3/my_experience_buying_owning_managing_and_selling/,1579044584.0,"A number of years ago I wanted, nay, I needed to do something to accelerate my time to being financially independent. This was basically me trying to turn frustration into something productive. I ended up looking into buying rental property. When I was initially considering buying a rental property, I had an easy time finding a ton of people trying to tell me what to do, but a hard time finding actual examples to think about myself. So I guess I'll post my experience in the hope that it's useful for people thinking about rental property as a source of income!

## Phase 1: Searching for properties
I spent over a year watching properties before I finally pulled the trigger and bought one. What I did during that time was spent time researching neighborhoods, attending classes on how to be a landlord provided by a local non-profit that mainly covered federal, state, and local laws, and making sure I understood the local residential rental market sufficiently well to convince myself I wasn't tossing money out the window. 

As part of my search, I developed [this spreadsheet (note: I just converted this from an Excel spreadsheet, there might be minor formula errors in it)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15D5l6Xkyo8Acs9LLZ99RkvZd2JVosPaduxAMumFewJQ/edit?usp=sharing), which gave me a chance to make sure I understood roughly what I was getting into, and also let me compare potential residential property purchases easier. The basic concept was I was comparing the total cost of ownership (purchase, maintenance, PITI, selling costs, income) against a hypothetical 8% investment return if I just invested the money in the market. If a property on paper could beat that fairly high hurdle, I would consider purchasing it. What was a bit frustrating was the number of variables that went into my spreadsheet, few of which I had control over. In general, my approach was to underestimate expenses and overestimate things like vacancy rates. Other factors I considered included things like distance from home and work, and general neighborhood feel and quality.

All in all, I evaluated 36 rental properties before purchasing one. 4 duplexes, 2 quadplexes, and the rest single family homes.

## Phase 2: The purchase and initial updates
I ended up purchasing a 3br/1ba single family home on a short sale (the one in the linked spreadsheet above) for $175,000. One interesting note here was that the seller's realtor was doing the work pro-bono, and I used a real estate lawyer to purchase, so the total cost of the transaction was $900. There were many things to remedy, so I had saved up about 2 weeks of vacation and my plan was to take all of my vacation and remedy everything I could reasonably do for $5k. This turned into 2 60-hour weeks of work, and then 2 more weeks of 20 hours each (in addition to my normal work week) to get everything in shape for renters, and that wasn't even including the time my wife spent helping me. Basically every surface was modified, including drywall, carpets, refinishing wood floors, refinishing cabinets, refinishing wood trim, and many other minor repairs. The mortgage I was able to get required 25% down at 4.5%, so a down payment of $43,750. Since I immediately had to put $5,123 into it, this meant my immediate investment totaled $48,873.

## Phase 3: Landlording
My process for evaluating potential renters included background checks, calling previous landlords, verifying employment, and meeting the renters in person. I had 2 landlords with decades of experience that I met through some of the earlier mentioned landlording classes that helped me decide on renters. The main lesson I learned here is that no matter how careful you are, you won't be able to avoid all potential problematic renters. I had 3 renters in the ~3.5 years I ended up owning the place, and there were issues on some level with all of them. My rent started at $1630 the first month, and increased slowly over time.

I ended up owning the property for just under 4 years total. Here are the numbers from that time:

| Year | Rent    | Principal | Interest | Tax&Ins | Maint  | Improve | Deposit | Cash Flow | Net Income | Hours Spent | 
|------|--------:|----------:|---------:|--------:|-------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|-----------:|------------:|
| 2016 |  $9,780 | $1,046    | $2,943   | $2,459  | $0     | $5,123  | $0      | $3,330    | ($745)     | 248         |
| 2017 | $19,560 | $2,166    | $5,814   | $5,417  | $750   | $0      | $550    | $5,962    | $8,128     | 47          |
| 2018 | $20,040 | $2,264    | $5,715   | $5,730  | $1,100 | $0      | $0      | $5,223    | $7,488     | 59          |
| 2019 | $18,370 | $2,167    | $5,147   | $4,760  | $750   | $35,111 | $2,400  | $2,934    | ($30,009)  | 342         |

To be clear: 

 * Cash Flow = (Rent + Deposit) - (Principal + Interest + Tax&Ins) - Maint
 * Net Income = CashFlow + Principal - Updates

Net Income isn't really useful, the improvements column wasn't something I could deduct immediately, improvements are basically treated as new investments that start depreciating on their own schedule, so I could only start depreciating a small fraction of them. Tax&Ins in the above table is just the property taxes. Income taxes were more complicated. Here's another table for it:

| Year | Cash Flow | Bracket | Depreciation | Income Taxes | Carryover |
|------|----------:|---------:|-------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| 2016 | $3,330    | 28%      | $3,872       | $0           | ($572)   |
| 2017 | $5,962    | 28%      | $4,079       | $367         | $0       |
| 2018 | $5,223    | 24%      | $4,079       | $274         | $0       |
| 2019 | $2,934    | 24%      | $4,435       | $0           | ($1501)  |

Note that the ""Carryover"" for 2019 is going to be subtracted out of the 2019 tax bill a bit later.

## Phase 4: Selling
I decided to sell late in 2019 and managed to close before the end of the year. There were significant repairs made prior to the sale which I was allowed to deduct, and proceeds from legal action. Hey, how about another table (edit: I borked this table somehow, falling back to lines of text):

Sale Price   $248,500 

Realtor Fees $14,910
 
Repairs/Imp $35,111 

 Net Legal  $3,600  

The adjusted cost basis for the property given the depreciation and repairs/improvements is $198,769. The adjusted sales price minus the realtor fees is $233,590. This means that I have $33,320 in capital gains after subtracting the remaining carryover from 2019. So my total taxes due are the capital gains at the capital gains rate, and depreciation recapture at my top federal rate capped at 25%, or: ($33,320 x 0.15) + ($16,465 x 0.24) = $8,949. There are various other modifiers to that tax bill, for example, I finally had unrented time, and there were other small deductions I could make that I'm not going into here, that bring my bill for 2019 to $8,455. This means that after the entire sale process, I netted $24,865.

## Phase 5: Totals and comparison against total market over the same time period

OK, so how did I do in total? I ended up making $45,914 on my initial investment of $48,873. Woot. 

If you remember from way back at the beginning, my hypothetical threshold was comparing the money I invested ($48,873) at a hypothetical 8% investment return. I'm not including the second round of improvements because they were basically put in place immediately before selling. I could also compare against how the market actually did over that same time period. OK, let's do all of the above. I bought the place in April of 2016, so we're using April 1 as the start date, so the first year was only 3/4 of a year. I sold a few days before the end of 2019, so I'll count 2019 as a full year.

 * If I invested $48,873 @ 8% APY, I'd have $62,260
 * If I invested $48,873 in VTSAX, I'd have $81,618
 * If I bought the property I did, I'd have $94,787
 
So I actually outperformed the crazy market over the past almost 4 years. The thing I haven't added in though is the 696 documented hours of time I spent working on the property and things related to the property. If I were to value my time at $20/hr, I'd underperform VTSAX. Yikes.

I haven't actually filed my taxes yet, I got an actual tax professional to help me through this year's taxes, so the tax numbers are estimated but should be pretty close to the final values.

I pulled the FIRE trigger today and gave notice that my last day will be June 5, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I had to call my supervisor and notify her since we rarely see each other. She wasn’t shocked, as I had briefly mentioned a few months prior that I was financially independent. She asked if there was anything that she could have done differently – there was not. She asked if I was retiring or if I had something else lined up. I just said that I was not submitting an official reason, but we could meet up if she wanted to hear a long list of personal reasons that I drafted. She didn’t seem at all interested. I wasn’t exactly a model or valuable employee. I wasn’t thanked for my twelve years of service, or for the fact that I never missed a day of work. Five minutes prior to the phone call, my wife finally admitted that she was glad I was quitting. This was something I already knew, but was always sidestepped and avoided upon questioning. This had to be my decision. And it was.

I previously posted my story about my FI journey, but here’s a quick summation since there will inevitably be questions. I have been with my wife since 1998. We got married in 2007 and have been single-income for 90% of the time with no kids. I graduated high school in 1997, college in 2001, and pharmacy school in 2005. I entered the workforce on August 15, 2005 in a tough retail pharmacist career that I cared nothing about. Realizing before I ever began that I didn’t want to do this for the rest of my life, I resolved to spend at a level that matched the standard of living from my youth so that I could retire before turning 40. I didn’t even know that FIRE was a popular thing 18 months ago!

My salary plus benefits started at about 115k/yr and ended at around 150k/yr. My spending started at around 30k/yr in 2005 and ended at around 38k/yr in 2017. I estimate that my average savings rate was 70% for nearly twelve years. I was fortunate to have some scholarships, as well as parents who supported me. The current bull market has also been of enormous benefit. I made a lot of good decisions and a few bad ones. From 2005-2011, I maximized 401(k) and IRA contributions every year while the balance went to paying off real estate. Our house, land, and personal property were fully paid off for around $250k and have since appreciated to $400k. The 401(k) and IRA contributions were a mix of VSCIX (small cap) and VFIAX (S&P 500) but were moved entirely into VSCIX near the bottom of the market in 2011.

Once the house was paid off, and after the 401(k) and IRA contributions were made each year, leftover funds from 2012-2017 went into a mix of VFWAX (international stocks) and VWLUX (US municipal bonds) in a private Vanguard account. My future AA will be 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total international stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds) or perhaps 40/40/20 (I have yet to decide). My current spending of 38k/yr will drop back to 30k/yr as a direct consequence of retiring (3k less on health care from some tenuous ACA subsidies, 1k less on flexible vacation spending, 3k less on eating out, 1k less on fuel consumption, 1k less on homeowners insurance, and 1k more on entertainment).

Once everything is settled, investments will total approximately 1.03M for a SWR of 2.9% (a drop to 1.9% if wife keeps her part-time hobby employment, a rise to 3.4% if she quits and the ACA subsidies disappear) but I might opt for a 3.0% SWR so that I can increase withdrawals from 30k/yr to 31k/yr. All of this works out to about 620k across retirement accounts entirely in VTSAX with 410k in private accounts as a mix of VWLUX and VFWAX, in addition to personal property worth 400k for a total net worth of 1.403M.

Although I stand to get 10k/yr from SSI, perhaps 500k in inheritances, supplemental income at some point, and a not-too-far-fetched possibility of national healthcare or UBI, I don’t assume these. As far as life after retirement, I have many hobbies, interests, and goals to pursue, so I won’t be bored. Returning to some compensating endeavor far into the future is also likely. Finally, I want to thank this subreddit for having so many members willing to offer input, encouragements, and criticisms that helped me out tremendously in the past few months.",financialindependence

It's a nice feeling for me and it's tough to share that feeling with people in my life so I'll share it with you.

I'm currently 29, I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Environmental Science, 90k of student loan debt and no strong direction of where to take it.  I moved back to my home town and started working at a hotel while I looked for more career oriented jobs, but didnt come up with much over the first 2 years and over those years realized I quite loved what I was doing so decided to continue.  All of a sudden its 8 years later, still loving what I do and have a little to show for it.

I make $17.25 hourly thanks to my transition to a supervisor role, and make a reasonable amount of tips on top of that, I estimate about a 60k a year income.

I've dropped my student loans to about 4k at the moment, should be done this year. I have a 15 k emergency fund, 70k in investmests between a Roth IRA (Betterment) and a 401k through work.  I also have 20k in a slightly more conservative investment portfolio (also Betterment) in hopes of buying a home sometime soon, as I am currently renting.

All in all nothing crazy but wanted to share my personal journey of consistent saving up to this point, and say that I'm happy to be part of this community, its helping current me and future me simultaneously.",financialindependence

I thought this article was interesting...

> Millennials are pushing back against the stereotype that their money management skills are lacking, as 16% now have savings of $100,000 or more, double the amount of young people who had socked away that much in 2015, according to a new Bank of America survey.

> The perception that Millennials — Americans between the ages of 23 and 37  — lack savvy when it comes to saving for retirement, budgeting and setting up and sticking to a financial plan is showing signs of being outdated, noted the survey, made available exclusively to USA TODAY. 

> Despite many of these young Americans coming of age a decade ago during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and despite being saddled with high student loan debt, Millennials appear to be getting their financial lives in order and taking money matters more seriously.

> Sixteen percent say they have $100,000 or more in savings, up from 8% in 2015. And nearly half (47%) have $15,000 socked away, up from 33% in 2015.

> ""Despite stereotypes of Millennials as being foolish with money and not long-term planners,"" they are actually behaving ""quite responsibly"" when it comes to money, says Andrew Plepler, global head of environmental, social and governance at Bank of America, summarizing the findings of the bank's 2018 Better Money Habits Millennial Report released Tuesday. ""They deserve more credit. Millennials are actually doing better than you — and they — might think.""

> About two of three (63%) of Millennials surveyed say they ""are saving,"" which is in line with 64% of Generation X but shy of 75% of Baby Boomers who set money aside.

> More importantly, 54% of Millennials say they have a budget, with nearly three of four (73%) saying they stick to the budget each month. And another 57% say they have a ""savings goal,"" which is higher than the 42% of Gen Xers and Boomers who say they are saving with a goal in mind.

> Those better habits are translating into more sizable account balances — and more financial security.

> About 60% say they ""feel financially secure.""

> ""Their financial habits have become more disciplined,"" Plepler says. ""They've built it into their lifestyles.""

> Aside from saving for an emergency, which 64% said was a ""top priority,"" half (49%) said saving for retirement and a third (33%) said saving to buy a house were their top savings goals.

 

> Other key findings of BofA's Millennial survey, however, suggest this young generation still suffers from money-related angst and that there's still room for improvement in their cash-management skills.

> The top financial ""stressors"" of Millennials, according to the survey, include:

* Not saving enough (35%).

* My career path (24%).

* Not planning and saving for retirement (21%).

* Not being able to afford a home (20%).

* Health costs (19%).

* Student loans; spending more than I should; credit-card debt; not having enough to invest; losing my job (17% for all).

> One potential challenge for Millennials saving for retirement is the fact that one in four (26%) say they work in the ""gig economy,"" or take on short-term contract work or freelance work. That means they likely don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement account, such as a 401(k), and, as a result, they have to save on their own.

> ""These gig workers have to be more intentional about their saving,"" Plepler says.  ""The findings of our survey are encouraging, however. Millennials are taking much more proactive steps around saving. But this is an issue we have to monitor.""",financialindependence

369,[~1 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,,2537,bk1rco,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/,1556840295.0,"Link to original thread. I FIREd and quit my job in the US last year, then moved to Thailand to volunteer at a non-profit teaching English to former prostitutes and low-level criminals for tourism industry jobs. I'm an American, ethnically Chinese.
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/

I knew the cost of living in Bangkok would be substantially cheaper than what I am used to paying, but I was not prepared as to how much cheaper. My apartment and utilities were provided for free by the non-profit and I lived with my fellow expat volunteers. Some were older couples who wanted their privacy, so they booked their own apartments. Costs ranged from as low as $200 a month for a cheap, non-furnished studio apartment to $375 a month for a furnished studio in a newer building near a Skytrain station in the center of town with security. I was pleasantly surprised that because I was in the country on a sponsored work visa, I was eligible to buy health insurance there as a local. It came out to about $150 a month. Getting international expat health insurance here in America would have cost me up to $500 a month, so a huge savings. I also rarely ate at home and never cooked, since Bangkok is one of the great street food capitals of the world. All kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab food served on the street for about 35 to 70 baht each entree (~1 to 2 bucks USD). I ended up not getting a local cell phone or local cell plan, my Sprint plan included international roaming and the 2G data was okay for Google Maps and web/email use when I was away from wifi, which was rare.

So monthly fixed expenses came out to
 
* $150 health insurance
 
* $200 eating out

* $100 7-Eleven (drinking tap water actively discouraged by authorities due to corroded pipes. Bottled water is substantially cheaper there than here, thankfully. My problem is that when I went into 7-Eleven every day to get the cheap water, I would get sidetracked by whatever tasty unfamiliar snack I would see at the hot food counter that I would then have to try, hence $100 a month blown. Seriously, 7-Eleven in Thailand is amazing, I highly recommend getting lost in one. All kinds of hot noodle soups and baos and sticky rice snacks and cakes.)

* $150 Skytrain and subway tickets, Uber/Grab app rides on the back of a motorcycle. 

* $250 random spending money on cheap knock-off clothes or gifts to take home or a ladyboy cabaret show or a concert or pro kickboxing match, etc.

* =$850/month total. 
Let's say I had to get my own furnished apartment and pay for my utilities, add another $500 a month. $1,350 a month total is pretty good considering I lived like a king and didn't budget myself at all. I could get that below $1,000 a month if I was more frugal.

My non-fixed expenses were for airfare and lodging when I would leave town for the weekend to explore the rest of SE Asia. If I could book trips early enough, I could get round trip flights on Scoot or AirAsia to Chiang Rai or Singapore or Penang for as little as $40 round trip. Other than Singapore, Airbnbs and budget hotels were dirt cheap, so those weekend trips rarely cost more than $200 each.

I wrapped up my volunteer work and came home to America this past week. Was gone about 10 months. Was a great experience, met a lot of new, nice people. Learned a new (incredibly difficult) language. Regret nothing, would do it all over again. I was able to get a small taste of Vietnam during my time there and am fascinated, will probably go live in Hanoi for a few months when I go back in the future.

My immediate future is to spend the next two weeks hanging out with my family and doing lots of yard work and handyman work around the house. I'll then get on a plane for Scotland to spend two weeks seeing friends and being a tourist. Was a last minute trip, Delta had round trip tickets from select US cities to London Heathrow for $370, I couldn't resist. Absurdly cheap.

Also - about three or four months after I moved to Thailand, my former boss called me to see how I was and offered me an online-only job, where I would spend about an hour to 90 minutes a day remotely reviewing other people's work, answering internal emails and listening to ideas he would bounce off of me. I wasn't interested, but he insisted it would not be my old job, that I would still be a digital nomad and never come into the office and I would be eligible for 401k matching and the company's health insurance when I came home. So I said yes and I've been doing the job for about half a year. It's been as advertised, I set aside an hour or so a night on my laptop in front of the TV and it hasn't grown into anything bigger yet. The salary is a small, small fraction of what I used to make but it's worth my time. We'll see how things stand after another year.

[EDIT] Hey, thanks for the gold. First time ever getting it, awesome.

[EDIT 2] Am getting lots of questions about how I reached $2.3 million, or $2.6 million as of this morning post-jobs report rally. I cover this in my earlier threads briefly - I left grad school at 24 and worked a job for ~14 years. Socked away about $70,000 per year the entire time, so there's half my money. The other half came from investment gains. I did the majority of buying in the years immediately after the 2009 subprime meltdown and financial crisis, large cap US banks and technology names for pennies on the dollar. Many of you are too young to remember, but I remember all of it. Having money in those conditions was terrifying. Bear Stearns and then Lehmann failing were earth shattering events. I lost entire $20,000 to $30,000 investments in companies in the blink of an eye. The ones that survived and thrived, those gains are still largely unrealized. meaning I have not sold them yet and I'll get slapped with an enormous long-term capital gains tax bill when I do, which is fine. Obvious question, how was I able to save so much for so long. One big reason is living in a southern state with low cost of living and no state income tax. I'm able to hold onto at least $15,000 to $25,000 more per year based on those two factors alone compared to someone in California, for example. The drawbacks to that are the government services in my state are pretty crap and minimal and all our new highways are toll roads, and so forth.

[EDIT 3] What am I going to do when I get back from the UK in a month? The plan for now is to spend real quality time with my family, I've been gone for a year. I'll be home for three months, maybe longer. Reconnect with friends and so forth. I plan on then leaving at the beginning of fall for a months-long driving trip around the Western US and Canada, hitting up as many national and state parks as I can. For years, I have followed r/vandwellers and r/tinyhomes and wanted to buy a gutted Mercedes Sprinter cargo van with the extended ceiling to build a living space in. I've decided now not to do that for gas mileage and excess space reasons, it's more space than I need by myself. I'm probably going to buy a used Nissan Rogue and spend a week performing minimal modifications. Such as buying plywood to construct a bed platform in the back that allows me to store clothing below the bed. Can install a minimal solar kit on the roof so I have power for my laptop and phone at night. Can either camp at night, stay at Airbnbs or sleep in the car. Can shower at truck stops or Planet Fitness locations with my membership. I'll drive south to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas when the heavy snow and ice starts to fall and resume my trek north next spring. We'll see.",financialindependence
370,Hanging up my 37 pieces of flair,,2521,bem2hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bem2hs/hanging_up_my_37_pieces_of_flair/,1555596991.0,"I’ve finally made it to FIRE and no longer need to be a pretty boy and display my flair. Friday is my last day at the office. I know you guys like detailed breakdowns of net worth growth and the like, but I don’t really have that. For whatever reason, I always just overwrote my spreadsheets from my last quarterly update. I guess I wasn’t all that concerned with the trajectory, only the final number. But I’m willing to share what I do have, both how I got here and where I’m going.

(Unless otherwise noted, all numbers below are combined for my wife and I, despite me writing in the first person. She’s cool with that, I checked. We hold only a stock/bond portfolio and have no other investments.)

Here’s what I can tell you. I had $700k at the start of 2017 with a minimum FIRE goal of $900k ($36k/yr at 4%WR), which I would’ve hit my savings and a 0% return for 2017 and 2018. Considering that the next bear market was imminent at that time (just like now if you listen to the pundits), I made a plan to work those two years before re-evaluating. As I’m sure you’re aware, 2017 market returns were big (20+% US, 27%+ Int’l), and I hit $1MM in early 2018. This bounced around some as 2018 was fairly volatile, and I lost my second comma at the end of 2018. They’ve since bounced back and I currently have about $1.1MM.  We picked our retirement date of 4/19/19 back in October 2018.  It’s Good Friday, and it will most definitely be a good friday. 

I’m 42 years old and have never made 6 figures. In fact, I never even broke $50k/yr until age 38. My wife is 41, and she has never made 6 figures either, but generally always out-earned me (except for two absolutely glorious months back in 2017). We have no kids, but that was decided well before we even knew FIRE was a thing. I work as a non-CPA accountant (A/R) and I always pay attention to the mundane details and put the decimal point in the right place.  She works for a major hotel chain and knows a lot about TPS reports. We have always lived in HCOL areas, first in Chicago (2001-2009) and then in Silicon Valley (2010 - present). As such, our real talent is living a good life while not spending much money. The last few years, we’ve spent right around $45k/yr, which I feel is pretty damn good for around here. Many of my coworkers spend that amount on housing alone. 

We keep our costs down in lots of practical ways. I’ve been a full time bike commuter for 5 years. We cook nearly every meal at home, eating out less than once a month, and even then it’s usually pho or something pretty cheap. We split one car, a 15 year old VW. We have the cheapest apartment of anyone I’ve ever met, currently at a high water mark of $1700/mo. It’s definitely a bit old and rundown, but it fits our needs and the neighbors are nice. We still live a very similar lifestyle to when we first met in our early 20s and had little money and I still rock my same Swingline stapler.

We weren’t always great at saving a bunch of money, but we worked up to it. When starting our first jobs, we each (independently) started contributing around 15% to our 401ks. And then we increased that percentage with each raise. But sometime in 2013, I stumbled upon MMM and was instantly hooked. I accepted those face punches graciously and we really kicked our savings up a couple of notches from then on. This also coincided with our peak earning years and a booming stock market, and suddenly early retirement seemed so much more accessible instead of some far off dream. 

About our only discretionary spending that moves the needle is on travel. We have always loved to travel together. We both currently work for companies in the travel industry, so we get a lot of company help. This was the best part about work the last few years. Just over this time, we took trips to Paris, Hawaii, Jamaica, Tahoe, and Vietnam that were at least partially subsidized by our employers. We even squeezed a few full priced trips in there too. Now, we are turning our travel up to 11 by going full nomad and plan to travel indefinitely without a home base. 

I'm not planning a static withdrawal rate. Instead I will use a variable withdrawal rate, with planned cutbacks when returns are negative (knocking us below our starting point) with the option to increase after years with big gains. My base spending estimate is $36k/yr which is about 3.25% of my current portfolio, but again, that will fluctuate. I will probably try to keep it under $36k/yr until weathering my first recession. The idea is that we can live a reasonably similar lifestyle but at different price points based on whether we’re sticking to cheaper countries or more expensive ones. As such, cutting back should not be painful like a case of the Mondays, it will just involve moving slower and/or staying in cheaper places longer. 

In general, I do not know how long we will travel or how much we’ll enjoy it. I think it’ll be great, which is why we’re doing it, but it’s hard to know until it actually happens. If we were to call it quits after only a few years, it’s entirely possible that one or both of us would need to work part time selling magazine subscriptions door to door (beats working at Intertrode) if we decide to move back to the US permanently. I hope it doesn’t come to that though. Ideally we slow travel for decades using a fairly low WR, cutting spending as needed, and our portfolio grows. This would allow more flexibility to increase spending as we age, whether that’s while still traveling or settling back in the US. I imagine travel in my 60s will require more comfort that travel in my 40s, so I’m trying to plan for that.

As it stands, I am not planning to carry health insurance while traveling, instead opting to just pay cash as needed like the locals do. I have a couple of months before we get on a plane, so I will research options further, but from what I’ve found so far, it’s not going to be worth it. When returning to the US to visit friends and family, I will buy a temporary high deductible catastrophic plan though. Obviously I cannot be in the US even for any period of time without insurance.  (Hey USA, what’s happening?  If you could go ahead and work on getting us up to developed world standards while we’re out galavanting around the world, that would be great. Mmmmkay?)
 
I hold a lazy portfolio consisting of all index funds. Total AA is 40/30/30 US/Int’l/Bonds. I have decided against using a bond tent. Originally, I thought about starting at 60/40 stock/bond and shifting this to 80/20 over 5 or 10 years. Instead, I just decided to go with 70/30 and stick with it. The backtest results are similar, and this fits better with my general [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) investing plan.

I do the vast majority of my posting on this sub while at work when I don’t have meetings with the Bobs, so I’m not expecting to continue contributing at my current rate. I don’t plan to disappear entirely, but will likely shift from resident genius know-it-all to focusing more on the post-FIRE aspect. :) 

That’s about all I can think of.  Got questions?  Fire away and I’ll do my best to answer them. 

TL;DR FIRE’ing at age 42 with about $1.1M for two people with a plan to spend ~$36k/yr (variable) while traveling the world indefinitely.  Never made 6 figures or even really close, just figured out how to enjoy life without spending much money and invested consistently over time.  Office Space is one of the best movies ever made.",financialindependence
371,I'm seeing a lot of misunderstanding about what FIRE is lately,,2501,a59gw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a59gw4/im_seeing_a_lot_of_misunderstanding_about_what/,1544552909.0,"Perhaps it's just me, but I've been noticing a lot of comments and posts lately from people who really don't get what FI/RE is, or what it's supposed to be about. Maybe we've just got an influx of new users or something, but I wanted to make a post to clear a few things up.

* First of all, FIRE **is not** limited to just the [MMM](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)/[ERE](https://www.amazon.com/Early-Retirement-Extreme-Philosophical-Independence/dp/145360121X) style, lean FIRE approach. Yes, getting super frugal and saving 75% of your take home so you can retire before 30 is **one** way to achieve FIRE. But it is not the only way. There are plenty of other approaches to this and plenty of reasons for why some people favor those approaches. 

* Second, FIRE **is not** limited to just people who retire before 30/35/40 or whatever imaginary cutoff you have in your head. I legitimately saw someone ask the other day if 55 was really ""early"" retirement. **Yes**, it emphatically is. An extra decade of your life outside of the workforce is *nothing* to scoff at. But really, FIRE isn't even limited to people who are retiring early. It's right there in the name ""*Financial Independence* / Early Retirement"". There are plenty of people in here who are doing this for reasons that have nothing to do with leaving the workforce before 65. 

* Third, FIRE **does not mean** you can't have [insert your preferred hobby/luxury/indulgence here]. I like the way Paula Pant phrases it. You can afford *anything*, you just can't afford *everything*. A lot of FIRE involves making decisions about what *your* priorities are. For some people that's just time to sit and read. For others it might be restoring luxury automobiles. And if you're the person in the latter position, that doesn't mean you can't still pursue FIRE. It just means you have make the choices about just how much of a priority it is and what you're willing to give up for it.

So, those are a few things that FIRE is not. If you're still confused about it, I would encourage you to take a look at the sidebar and read up on some of the resources there. But I would add one more thing to what you'll find in the sidebar:

* FIRE **is** personal. It's about pursuing *your* goals and *your* priorities. Not Mr Money Mustache's, or Jacob Lund Fiskar's, or (FIREguy8452 25m | 73% SR | 4.5% FI)'s. Yours. So don't get too caught up in seeing a lot of people talking about how you're ""supposed"" to approach FIRE. Their road to achieving their goals is not yours, and vice versa. 

Editing to add one because even though nobody's stated it explicitly, I seem to be seeing a lot of responses that assume it:

* FIRE **does not** require that you make a 6 figure income. One of the casualties of the focus on super high savings rates and super short timelines is that it *really* discourages people with low, or even average, incomes from trying to pursue this lifestyle. Plenty of people come around here asking (or maybe not asking, maybe just lurking and wondering to themselves) ""ok, I like the sound of this but how do I make it work on $40k a year"", only to be met by a chorus of ""you're not 'real FIRE' unless you're saving [percentage that would put their expenses below the poverty line]"". When in reality they could still make a real impact on their life with a more modest (and yet still several times larger than the national average) savings rate. Ostracizing and excluding these people helps nobody. Not only are they worse off because they didn't get the help they were looking for. But *we* are worse off for losing their perspective too. I can practically guarantee you can learn more from someone making a 15-20%SR work on a teachers' salary than you can from someone making a 70%SR work on a programmer's salary.

TL;DR: Rental real estate is a pain, but can be very lucrative if done right. Here's a whole bunch of things you might need to consider.

EDIT: Alrighty, I'm wrong about depreciation. Depreciation is still a thing, still affects your personal income taxes, but I'm heading right back to google to correct my own information. Guys, I wrote this whole thing off the top of my head based on what I have personally learned, and I sincerely apologize, I don't mean to be handing out bad advice. Looks like I personally need to learn a whole bunch more about how depreciation recapture works. 

EDIT 2: The VA and FHA loans *can* be good options. However, YOU need to shop all of your options. Do not just assume that the VA is the best way to go. If it is the best option for you, go for it. If not, go with other financing. 

Edit 3: I'm pretty risk averse when it comes to over-leveraging. I'm never going to suggest that someone buy a house with nothing down, especially not while in the military and subject to a short notice relocation. If you do your own research and choose to buy with nothing down, that's on you. I'm still not comfortable with it. 

Alright... wall of text coming in. Take what you can and leave what's not useful. Everything written here is what I've personally learned. I'm not a realtor or a professional property manager, but have been a landlord for 6+ years and have learned a lot. Most of those lessons learned had huge price tags on them, too. I purchased my first home in 2011, our second in 2014, and our third just last year. The first two are rented out. Not everything will apply to you, but here's what I've learned along the way. Topics are written in the order that I thought of them, my apologies if it's not 100% cohesive. As of right now, I have awesome tenants in both properties, but that hasn't always been the case. My approach to real estate is to 1, protect my own investment and 2, to provide a good home to my tenants. I've made some more generous financial decisions to both of those extents, and while those decisions cut into my profits a bit, I have no regrets. 

**Purchasing your first home**

**Should I rent or purchase?**

Don't over buy on your first purchase.

I say again, don't over buy.

If the market is white hot, it's going to cool off. And you don't want to be holding the chips when that happens. You really don't have the time to sit on the house and let it recover, unless you've got money somewhere you're not talking about. 2008 took about 10 years to fully recover from and to gain back the lost appreciation (most markets, at least) and you don't have 10 years. ​ If you do a zero down VA loan and roll the closing costs into the loan, it takes, on average, the first 18 months just to pay off the closing costs. Takes about 3 more years to get down to a break-even point with seller's closing costs included, and about 5 years before you'll make money. Yes, it seems like a lot of BAH to be ""throwing away"", but look at the actual makeup of a newly amortized mortgage - most of your payment is going towards things other than principle.

If you bring a down payment to the table, you've mitigated that part of your risk, but you're still exposed to lose money at the sale of the house. You've still got your purchase closing costs, which, on a $190k house are probably between $6000 and $9000, depending on your financing. Most of that is money that just evaporates.

If you can rent for LESS than the interest/insurance/taxes part of the payment and just dump the principal part into savings/mutual funds/TSP/IRA, you'll come out ahead. Granted, that normally means renting a smaller apartment instead of living in a nice house, but it's the sacrifice we make to be financially responsible.

Money in real estate is made 3 ways:

1, getting a good deal on the purchase.

2, holding the property for forever and getting the appreciation.

3, renting it out and making a profit off of someone else.

Normally, you want a good mix of all 3. The first takes PATIENCE when you're looking to purchase, and from what you've told me, a good deal just isn't available to purchase in Vegas right now. Strike one. Are you going to live in it long enough to ride out the bubble you see and make money when you sell? Meh, maybe not. Strike two. Do you want to landlord? If you've thought about it, scroll up and re-read again. If you're still on board, then its a consideration ​

Renting is buying patience. Seems like in your area, patience is what you need. There's always a house to buy in the future.

Rents do rise and fall, but they don't rise and fall nearly as fast as real estate does in a white-hot market. Hence the 1% per month rental price as an approximation. If there's a $200,000 house that's renting for $1500 a month, and the house next door sells for $220,000, the first house likely went up 10% in value. However, your landlord isn't going to jack your rent 10% in the middle of the lease just because Zillow thinks his house is now worth what the one next door sold for. If you rent, you're protected from the competitive spikes in purchasing, and are more exposed to the long-term appreciation of pricing. Your landlord's costs of ownership are fixed (unless he's on an interest only loan, and then he's stupid), so he can offer you rent at a fixed or gradually increasing rate. He's not trying to compete with other buyers to purchase a first home like you are. 

**VA Loan**

The VA loan... not my favorite topic. First off, you're almost always better off going with conventional financing if you've got a down payment, and no one should ever purchase a home if they don't have one. The VA loan brags about not having PMI, but the funding fee is essentially pre-paid PMI. On a conventional loan, you can request that PMI be removed once you hit 78% LTV, but there's no option to un-do the prepayment of the funding fee. 

The first time the VA loan is used, the funding fee is 2.15% of the loan. After that, it's 3.3% of the loan unless the borrower brings 5% down. (https://www.veteransunited.com/education/library/va-funding-fee/)

The max amount of loan that the VA will insure is $453,000. You can have more than one VA loan at a time, but the two can NOT total more than that amount. With the median home price today, you're likely going to be going with conventional financing on the next house, anyway. The other option is to refinance the soon to be rental with conventional financing and re-use the VA entitlement on the new purchase, but again, I tend to shy away from VA loans all together. 

When I purchased my last home, my loan officer just assumed that I'd go with VA financing. I asked her to pull a quote for conventional and give me the break-even point. She didn't want to, but I made her do it anyway. She was shocked that, wow, I was right about my financing options. Not to brag, but she's used to checking boxes on paperwork, while I'm used to scrimping to make that precious SSgt pay last as far as possible.

**I'm buying near a military base, it's a good market, right?**

Ah, but buying close to base is BAD for appreciation. Because of the high turnover of military personal, there's always someone trying to sell their house. Always a lot of people, actually. This leads to high inventory and low demand. When there's high inventory, people start dropping prices to sell faster. You've seen the opposite right now in Vegas - low inventory and high demand cause a price spike. Same math, different side of the equation. 

With values depressed because of high inventory, sellers in a heavily military area will likely sell for their break-even point. If sales prices don't go up, neither does value. Neither does rents, and so BAH remains flat. BAH remains flat, and the next guy can't afford to buy your house for any more than you bought it for. It's a vicious cycle and it's common near bases. In this equation, the only people making any money are the real estate agents who have an unlimited supply of customers. 

The plus side is that you can usually get a lot of house for the money near a base. The only real way to break that cycle is to have an outside economic influence bleeding off the extra inventory. This happens when a small(ish) base is located in an area with other good paying jobs. If the only places to work in a 20 minute radius are the base and retail, tread carefully. 

**Working with a realtor**

Realtors are real estate professionals, and I always recommend a first time buyer work with a good agent. However, keep in mind that the realtor has a vested interest in you purchasing just as much home as you can. Same thing with the bank, they WANT you to borrow as much as they can reasonably let you have. Most people will make a decision about choosing a realtor based on personality and how well they ""jive"" with the person, but that's the wrong answer. You want someone who no-kidding knows the local market and who can educate you. 

It's like working with a military recruiter. It's their JOB to put you in the military and that's the direction they're going to steer you. And of course the recruiter is gonna tell you all the awesome things about the military - they've reenlisted and stuck around a while. Doesn't mean it's for every applicant, and it's still the applicant's job to do their own research. Same thing with the realtor. 

Anyone can show you homes and point out how awesome a kitchen is. Anyone can give you a listing from the MLS. That's not what you want. You need someone who can no kidding educate you and be your advocate. 

Now you're faced with the decision to sell or rent after your PCS. Here's some thoughts:

**Selling expenses**

Look at your HUD/Closing statement from when you purchased the house, but look at the seller's side of the page. Assuming you sell the house for a similar amount as you purchased (within 10% or so), you can assume that selling closing costs will also be within about 10% of those listed on the closing statement. Normally, you can assume that 10-15% of the value of the sale will be eaten up in closing costs and realtor fees. This could vary based on the terms of your sales contract, but most buyers push the seller to pay as much as possible. So, if your home is worth $200,000, you can expect to take home $170,000 - $180,000 after closing costs. If you owe more than that, then YOU will have to write a check to the bank for the difference at closing. It you owed $185,000 on the $200,000 home, and your net was $180,000, then you pay the bank the extra $5000 to close. Decide if it's worth it to ""feed"" the home (more details later) month to month as a rental or if it's better to take the lump sum hit now. If you rolled your purchase closing costs into the loan, did a zero-down VA, or have not owned the home very long, look at the numbers closely. The home may have appreciated enough to cover everything, it may not have.

**Fair rental value**

Industry standard is 1% of the property's value each month as rent. This should (should) give you a pre-expense rate of return of 12% on your money before appreciation. However, that estimate is not accurate in every market. Work with your realtor or property manager to figure out a good price point to start at. I started a little bit high, then negotiated down to my bottom line. Price too high and you won't attract a tenant. Price too low and you'll attract the wrong kind of tenant. Factor in your own expenses, but if your expenses are high, you may have to ""feed"" the property (more on that later). Find out what houses near you are currently renting for, and get a good guestimate for what you could get for your home. Factor in any perks - like if the washer/dryer are included, if there's a pool, if you allow pets, etc. 

1% monthly works, sorta. In a high-rental but low-ownership neighborhood, rents may be more like 1.5% of the sale-able value. In a high value neighborhood, you're likely not going to get quite 1% as anyone who can afford $5000 a month rent on a half million dollar home will just buy the thing themselves.

**Rental expenses**

Here's what you need to factor in when estimating your monthly expenses:
 Mortgage payment
 Property tax increase (more below)
 Landlord's insurance (more below)
 Vacancies
 Turnover cost
 Repairs
 HOA fees
 Extras like lawn care or pool maintenance 

**Vacancies**

Industry standard is 8-10% time vacant, or about one month a year. Factor this into the price of your rent to maintain year-round profitability. You may have a year with 20% vacancy, and then your next tenant stays for 4 years. No telling what will happen. 1 vacant month each year is a generic estimate. 

**Turnover cost**

Regardless of how awesome your tenants are, there's going to be standard wear and tear on your property. Each turnover will require a deep clean New carpet and new paint will be required every 3-5 years, more often with kids/pets/smokers. If you're not physically able to do this work, you'll be paying out-of-pocket for a contractor to do this work, and it adds up fast (mine was $40 an hour). The longer this work takes, the longer your property is empty, and it's hard to show a house that's not in good condition. Some of the more egregious turnover problems can be taken out of the security deposit, but that could also be contested by the departing tenant. 

**Utilities during turnover**

The property owner is responsible for turning on the utilities while the home is vacant. It's very difficult to do turnover repairs without water or electricity, and almost impossible to show a home without electricity. Usually a phone call to the local utility company to re-open the utilities in your name is all it takes, but the utility company may require you leave a deposit with them. This is something your property manager can take care of for you if you're no longer in the local area. Factor this into your cost of turnover. 

**Repairs**

Industry standard is about 10% of the rent set aside for repairs - this number combines turnover repairs AND the day-to-day issues. This could vary widely, based on the condition of the home, price of the rent, standard of tenant, etc. The more expensive rent price attracts a more financially responsible tenant, who will either take better care of the home or be pickier about you repairing every little thing. Finding a responsible tenant who treats the property well and who does the little things themselves (I had a tenant who thought I owed him lightbulbs) will go a long way. 

**Listing fees**

The typical realtor who's listing your property for rent will take half the first month's rent as the listing fee. Half of that remains with the listing agent, and half goes to the tenant's agent. Factor this into your price of rent. Half the first month's rent, paid once a year (estimate, with 1-year leases turning over once a year), is about 4% of the annual rent cost. This is normally in addition to monthly management fees. 

**Management fees**

Usually 10% of the monthly rent in addition to the listing fees. Make sure you're getting your money's worth with this. If you've got a good tenant and can manage repair issues long-distance, you may only need to pay for listing fees. However, that leaves your property without an eyes-on look from someone other than a tenant, and that's not wise. Either way, find a good handyman in the area and keep them on speed dial. 

**HOAs**

Read your HOA docs and find out exactly what you need to do to rent the property. Your HOA may require board approval of your tenant. Get that process started early. If there's strict lawn care or other appearance standards, it may be beneficial to hire a lawn care company and just include it in the price of the rent. Be sure to list HOA standards in your rental contract and leave the tenant responsible for adhering to them. HOA fees are normally included in the rent so that you guarantee that they're paid. 

In a condo situation, FHA financing regulations require a certain percentage of the complex to be owner-occupied or the complex will not be eligible for typical financing. Without the ability to get FHA financing, the units will be less sell-able, and therefore will drop in value. In an effort to preserve the sale-ability and value of the entire complex, condo HOAs will deny requests to turn an owner-occupied unit into a rental IF the complex is close to that percentage. When purchasing a condo with the intent to rent in the future, ask the HOA about this. HOAs are also responsible for the maintenance of the parking lot, exterior structure, etc, and if the finances are poorly managed, it could result in an assessment against each unit. This is yet another financial contingency you must be ready for. 

In a typical single family home neighborhood, the management of the HOA can still make-or-break the rental situation. Do your research and talk to the board. 

**Pool**

A pool is easily $40,000+ worth of value in the home, and it's likely to your financial advantage to properly maintain it. Tenants may or may not care for it the way you would, you have to make the risk management decision. Consider hiring a pool maintenance company and include it in the price of the rent. One less thing for the tenant to worry about, and you've got the asset covered. Similar consideration should be made to AC system maintenance - just have the AC guy come once a year for a tune-up and add it to the pile of expenses. 

**Pets**

Your call on pets. Once pets live in the house, it's going to be hard to rent to non-pet owners unless you replace all the carpet. Pets can also kill the lawn and/or landscaping. I personally have pets and have had my own pets in my homes, so I've allowed my tenants to also have pets. You can attract a tenant who's willing to pay a bit more to have a good house with a good yard for their dogs. I always charge a non-refundable pet deposit, usually $250. That money will go towards cleaning or replacing the carpets or other damages directly from the pets. 

**Landlord's insurance**

You will need a new insurance policy on the property. A typical homeowners policy covers the home AND the contents, whereas a landlord's policy covers just the home. As the landlord's policy covers less, it's generally cheaper than the homeowners policy. However, if you had any challenges underwriting your home (pool, trampoline, closeness to the water, unpermitted work, etc) you'll have those same challenges underwriting a landlord's policy. 

**Property taxes**

Many states have a homestead exemption for a first home that's occupied by the owner. Once you rent out your home, you will lose the homestead exemption the following tax year. You will have an escrow deficiency that year (make it up in cash) and then a higher payment after that year's escrow analysis. Homestead exemption is typically $50,000 off the assessed value, so you can guestimate by adding that much to your value and then figuring out what the new taxes should be. For my house, it's about $1100 extra a year, or just shy of $100 a month. Make sure you include this in your rent pricing, and do careful research into the property tax laws of your county. 

**Cash flow break-even rent pricing**

Mortgage payment (including increased property taxes) , +10% management fee,
 +4% annual turnover,
 +10% expected repairs,
 +8% vacancy,
 +HOA fees,
 + extras (pool, lawn).
 I'm not factoring in pool or lawn expenses, as those are usually considered perks and added in afterwards. 

With a property manager: payment + 32%. Without a property manager: payment + 22%. Without a property manager and self-listing: payment + 18%

Now, take that number, and compare it to the typical market rents of houses near you. Can you cover your expenses? Break even? Come out ahead? Will you have to ""feed"" your home? If so, how much? 

**Feeding the home**

Feeding the home is when you're spending more in expenses monthly/yearly than you're making in rent. Sometimes this is due to a catastrophic repair event, sometimes this is due to market fluctuation. Sometimes this is due to over-leveraging in your financing (zero down loan) and a high interest cost. Whatever the reason, you need to make a risk calculation to decide to continue feeding the property extra money or to just cut your losses and sell the house. Here's a few ways to look at it. 

First, calculate your expected net loss at closing if you were to sell the property. Next, calculate how much you'd have to ""feed"" it monthly. Compare the two and find out your break even point. If you're looking at a $5,000 loss at closing, but only feeding the house $200 a month, your break even point is 25 months, or 2 years. In that 2 years, your property values can go up, your cost of ownership can go down (mostly your monthly interest cost), and market rents may increase. So, 2 years from now, calculate if it's worth it to continue keeping the property and move on from there. If you're feeding it $100 a month in contrast to a potential $20,000 loss, feeding it is likely the way to go. If you're feeding it $500 monthly while looking at a $2000 closing loss, you're probably better off to just sell it and move on. 

As you pay down the house, your equity increases and the cost of ownership decreases. Your return rates will therefore increase. If your monthly mortgage pay-off amount is around $450, but your feeding the house $200, your cash flow will show that you're losing $200 monthly, but your network has an overall gain of $250 monthly. This can be a fantastic long-term strategy, if you've got the finances and budget to sustain it in the short term. 

Catastrophic repair events happen, too, but these can increase the value of the property. For example, a new AC system may be $7000, but you'll get that money back when you sell it. Its a factor in planning, but not really a month to month expense. More on that later. 

Granted, all of these numbers are looked at before the emotional factor of personal finance is considered. If it's worth it to you to spend $200 a month to keep your dream home for 2 more years until retirement, then that's an emotional decision. A perfectly reasonable one to make, if that's what you want to do. Just factor everything in together when looking at the big picture. 

**Tenant screening**

Obviously, selecting good tenants is key to maintaining a good rental relationship. I had tenants who ended up growing pot in my house and cost me a significant amount of money. Renting to military families is also hit or miss, I've had fantastic military families in my homes and challenging military families in my homes. Even if you list the property yourself, run a full background check and look at their financial ability to pay you. I don't pay too much attention to their credit score (unless there's a glaring problem), but do look at their ability to PAY their rent on time. 

**Managing the tenant relationship**

There's another person living in my largest financial asset. I try my best to be open and accessible, without getting too buddy-buddy. If there's an issue with the house that falls on the landlord's responsiblity, I've tried to err on the side of the tenant. For example, the month that my tenants had to heat their house with their stove while we installed a replacement HVAC system, I covered their natural gas bill. With good tenants, the good will generally pays off quite well. 

**Income Taxes**

You will pay income taxes on your rental profit. That's after deducting your expenses. Rental property expenses are not deducted in the same way as your primary mortgage interest - that's the difference between taking the standard deduction and itemizing. I normally take the standard deduction, as I don't have personal expenses worth itemizing. However, your rental property is treated like a small business and rental expenses will count against your rental income to get the bottom line.

The following expenses are deductible: Insurance, interest, property taxes, utilities, listing fees, management fees, HOA fees, repairs. You can also take depreciation (more later on that.) Upgrades and capital improvements are not deductible, but can be straight-line depreciated (I've never done this myself.) If, say, the roof goes bad and you spend $10,000 on a new roof, that's deductible. If you ADD on a deck, that's considered an improvement. 

The main out-of-pocket expense that you can't deduct is the principle part of your mortgage payment, as that's not an actual expense. That money still go towards increasing your net worth by increasing your equity in the property. 

I do my own taxes every year with the $79.99 version of TurboTax and a few hours worth of research. Good record keeping during the year is essential, especially when adding up all of those Lowes receipts for repairs. 

**Depreciation**

Oh, boy... Depreciation is the idea that an asset has a limited lifespan, and after a certain amount of time, the asset will be worth zero. The IRS allows you to take a fraction of that every year, and consider it an expense against your income. (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp) Taking depreciation will reduce your income taxes, however, you will pay capital gains taxes on the depreciated amount when you go to sell the property. 

With long term capital gains set at 15% (for most people), chances are that you're better off taking the depreciation if your current marginal (not effective) tax rate is above 15%. There's no telling what tax rates will do in the future, though. If/when you sell the property, hopefully you'll have the cash available to pay the taxes at that time. 

Depreciation can be compared to the tax advantages of a retirement account. It's is more like the Traditional instead of the Roth, where you take the tax break now but pay for it later. 

When you sell the property (either because you wanted to or because you're dead and the estate is selling it), the capital gains taxes are paid as follows: Net of sale (market rate minus selling expenses), minus original purchase price, plus depreciation taken. 

If the house purchased for $100,000, depreciation will be around $3000 a year. Letssay, 4 years in, you've depreciated the house by $12,000. Your basis in the home is now $88,000, NOT the original $100,000. You sell it for $150,000, net $127,500 (15% of $150,000). $127,500 - $88,000 = taxable gains of $39,500 x 15% = taxes of $5925. Without depreciation, the taxable gains would have been $27,500 and taxes of $3300.

**The emotional factor of landlording**

My husband and I rented out our first home after we upgraded to a larger one. A few months later, he was at the home fixing a minor issue and saw how our tenant was taking care of the property. The place was dirty, smelled bad, and overall not well kept (bad tenant screening on my end). This was OUR home, the home we brought out daughter home from the hospital to, the home that we shared our wedding night in. Seeing it treated poorly by a stranger was a punch in the gut. No amount of money was worth seeing our memories misstreated like that. 

Or is it? You're going to have to decide what your emotional investment into the property is and if you can allow it to become someone else's home. This isn't a financial decision as much as it is a personal one. The personal influence can cause you to make a less than optimal financial decision concerning the property, so just keep that awareness as you make those critical decisions. 

**Internal financial management**

Per most states' state law, rental security deposits must not be commingled with other monies. I keep a separate savings account with the security deposit and just don't touch it. Any interest that the deposit accrues is owed back to the tenant at the time that they move out. 

I have a separate checking account for my property. Rents are paid in, expenses paid out. That way, everything is in ONE location and it's easy to figure out exactly what our profit/loss is. If you're managing a property locally, get a debit card on that account for Lowes purchases. I also keep a savings account for each property for escrow and repairs. (one property is paid for, so I maintain a manual escrow account, the other is a straight emergency fund.) 

I structure my personal budget to pay my mortgages and rental expenses out of our base pay, and then use the rents to put money into retirement, savings, and my daughter's college fund. That way, if (when) there's a vacancy or a problem, I'm not coming out in the red during those months. We can at least cover our expenses on our base pay, even if there's a month or two where we don't quite get to retirement contributions. 

In addition to emergency funds set aside directly for the property, make sure you can handle the one-off catastrophic emergency. 

**Catastrophic emergency**

Last year, I lost $22,000 in rental real estate, between rehabbing my first home, fixing up the second, recovering from crappy tenants in the second, and worse. The city hit my sewer main, said it was my fault, and I was out $10,000 in a single month. 3 years ago, the heater in my first house went out in December, and I wrote a check for $7000. I currently have $16,000 invested in 3 different sewer main re-builds under two different houses. (never, EVER again buying anything with cast iron pipes.) These things happen, and we dealt with all of this on SSgt pay. Thankfully, most of those losses have been made up over the next 1-2 years' worth of rent, but you NEED to have the cash on hand to be able to cover these types of emergencies. Good credit is also helpful - I had to borrow $10,000 once to cover turnover and repairs, but ended up coming out on top in the end. Ultimately, your rental property is likely a significant chunk of your net worth, and while it may hurt to spend ten grand on a repair issue, that's only 5% of the value of a $200,000 home. Not worth losing a whole asset over 5%. 

**The hassle factor**

Landlording is not easy. Dealing with people, finances, local real estate markets, construction type repairs, etc. It's a package deal. Some months I spend 30 minutes on it and make a decent amount of money. Some months it's 30 hours a week and I lose money. Overall, I've done pretty well, but it's the law of averages. 

Purchasing the next home with a rental

SOOOO... you're on the brink, ready to rent out your current house and go buy another one. Here's some things to think about: 

**Financing considerations**

So, you've PCSed and now want to buy a new house at your next duty station. That's great, now you need to convince a loan officer to give you another mortgage for another property.

First, you're going to have to be able to afford a second mortgage with your current debt to income ratio. If your rental mortgage is all the debt you have, you're probably in a good spot. Add in some vehicle or student loan debt, and now it doesnt look too good. 

You can use you rental income to compensate for the rental mortgage, but the bank will want to see 2 years tax returns with the income. Depending on when you converted it to a rental and what time a year you want to buy, 2 years tax returns can take closer to parts of 4 years to document. 

**Purchase conservatively**

The bank will do all they can to max out your DTI (debt to income ratio) to earn just as much interest off of you as they can. By choosing a smaller/cheaper home for your initial or second purchases, you can reign in the budget. Think of who you're going to rent to when you PCS, and make sure you can afford to rent within BAH rates. Just because the bank says you can borrow a half million dollars on a mortgage doesn't mean you should. And if you do, you will have zero room to finance the next property. Scroll back to the top where we talked about not over-buying. 

**Leverage ratios**

Alright, heading into the weeds here... The more you've borrowed against a property, the higher the leverage ratio. This isn't generally a problem if you're living in your own home and plan to remain there for quite some time, but it does become a factor when the bank starts looking at your suitability for the next purchase. (https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-don-ts-in-using-real-estate-leverage-2867098) 

If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $100,000, your leverage ratio is .90, that's very high. If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $400,000, your leverage ratio is now 0.225. That's very conservative. With the same debt to income ratio, the real estate owner with the lower leverage ratio is going to be a much safer customer to the bank. You can better your leverage ratios by 1, paying down the house or 2, letting it appreciate. The first is within your control, the second is not. 

**Interest expense**

The single greatest expense in the first year of home ownership is the purchaser's closing costs. Beyond the first year, the greatest expense on a financed property (barring an enormous catastrophic event) is the interest expense. The lower your interest expense, the higher your profit. You can lower your interest expense by 1, getting a better rate and 2, borrowing less. You can borrow less by either putting more down on the home, or by paying it down early. 

**Paying off a house early**

So, this one is highly controversial in the landlord business. Some folks will say to borrow as much as possible against a rental property because the interest is completely tax deductible and you can leverage your cash to purchase multiple properties. It's also possible (some years) to make a better rate of return in the stock market. While both of these schools of thought have validity, it's overlooking the factor of RISK. I've personally paid off a rental property and it was one of the greatest feelings in the world. Sure, I'm not making quite as much on that money as I could, but the risk on a paid for property is much lower than with a financed property. It also doesn't count towards my DTI any more, and isn't much of a hassle factor in future property financing decisions. At a minimum, paying off the house will give you a return equal to the interest rate, minus the marginal taxes you would have paid if you had taken the deduction. However, if you achieved a greater rate of return elsewhere, you'd also owe taxes on that, at either capital gains rates or your personal marginal tax rate. 

If your goal is to churn and burn and just buy as many properties as possible, you're likely going to finance all of them as much as you can. If your goal is to retire from the military with one or two investment properties, then work towards paying them off at a reasonable rate. 

**Conventional VS creative financing**

Creative financing is an option, but not one that most of us use. This would be something like, say, getting a loan from your uncle's IRA to buy the house, and then you pay your uncle the interest. This is do-able if you've got rich friends/family who are willing to invest in your mortgage. However, loans like this require much more documentation when you're looking at the next deal. Because banks are used to dealing with conforming loans (the fancy term for loans that fit all the rules), they may balk at a lender with a creatively financed asset in their portfolio. You'll have a greater burden of paperwork and proof to demonstrate your continued creditworthiness. 

**Rental VS Owner occupied financing**

You can borrow money to purchase a rental, but the interest rates are usually a full or two full percentage points higher. On $100,000 borrowed, each full interest rate percentage is $1000 a year or $83 a month. Obviously, that amortizes, but that's the starting expense at month 1. 

**Refinancing a rental as a rental**

Once the home is no longer owner occupied, it doesn't fit the criteria for owner occupied financing. A re-finance at that point (to pull cash out, clear the VA entitlement, or re-structure of payments) will likely cost that $83 per month per $100,000 borrowed. If you live in a home that will be a rental and you need to update your financing, do it before you move out. 

**Larger down payment**

You can always entice a bank with a larger down payment. The more money you put down on the next deal, the lower their risk is. Borrowing less also raises your DTI by a smaller amount, and that can help get you approved. Coming up with a larger down payment while turning your current property AND PCSing can be challenging, so plan ahead. 

Here's another thing to think about with the down payment: Your down payment is your buffer between you and the real estate market fluctuating. If you have 5% equity in your house, and the market drops by 5%, you're basically imobile. If you have 25% equity and the market drops 5%, you're still down by that much of your net worth, but the remaining 20% equity gives you the ability to cover closing costs if you choose to sell, cover a dip in rents, etc. Better to lose money you have than money you don't. 

Let me say that again - Better to lose money you have, than money you don't.

**Balanced portfolio**

Guys, rental real estate isn't the whole thing. For the average homeowner, our home makes up the largest asset in our portfolio. If the house is paid for, it's probably the most significant portion of our net worth. As soon as it's rented, you now have one single asset worth a LOT of money, and all of your net worth is in the same asset class. 

Don't forget to contribute to retirement through tax advantaged accounts (IRAs, TSP, 401Ks, etc). There's been seasons in our life where we had to stop retirement contributions to get over a hump, but that should be the exception, not the norm. Do your own research if your rental property income changes the equation for you while deciding between Roth and Traditional contributions, but chances are, it shouldn't make that big of a difference. 

**Liquidity**

This is a problem, too. $100,000 worth of home may be worth $100,000, but it's very difficult to convert a house that another family is living in, into cash. Borrowing against the property is an option, but only if your DTI can support it. Selling the property, at a minimum, will take 60 days. Maintain the amount of liquidity in your overall net worth (mine is in my emergency fund) to balance the amount that's non-liquid. Your personal liquidity needs are dependent on your financial situation and your risk tolerance, but it is a factor to consider. 

If I missed anything... ask, and I'll find an answer. Hope this is helpful to someone here.

374,35 years old. 3.5MM net-worth (mostly from crypto). Feel like I don't deserve to FIRE.,,2471,f3txdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f3txdk/35_years_old_35mm_networth_mostly_from_crypto/,1581694951.0,"*TL;DR: Guy has a great job for many years. Gets big crypto windfall at the height of his career. Now feels like his job is pointless and trying to figure out life. Boo hoo feel bad for him. I'm such an idiot.*

I'll keep this quick(ish) for all of us short attention span havers. I'm 35 years old, I have a career in a field where I get to be a creator (sort of a YouTuber, sort of an artist, sort of a ""travel guide"", sort of a filmmaker, sort of an on-camera personality, BUT I have bosses telling me the kind of stuff to make). I **was** obsessed with this job/industry for the better part of a decade. For many years I got lots of travel, nice hotels shooting in foreign locations, eating nice dinners and lots of admiration and respect from peers and colleagues. I watched my income grow from mid $30k to literally 10x that over the span of 7 years. And, fortunately, I never acquired a taste for expensive things (save for some industry gear). So that meant I was saving a LOT of my income yearly. Well on my way to FI/FatFI before I even knew about this philosophy of investing.

In 2014, I discovered bitcoin. Please, please. I know that many here think bitcoin in a huge speculative gamble and after riding through a major UP and DOWN, you are preaching to the choir. Regardless, I love the idea of it and fell deep down the rabbit hole– reading and watching every bit of content I could find. Over the span of a year and a half I put ALMOST everything I saved into it– figuring my earnings would set me back ahead even if it tanks. (Again, I crazy/foolish I **know).** Long story short, the bull run hits in 2017, and I can't fucking believe it. Over the course of 6 months, hands shaking, I cashed out (after tax) about 2.8 million. I didn't even sell at the top.

Around this time, I was trying to learn how to ""live off the interest"", get off that crazy rollercoaster, invest **RESPONSIBLY–** I discovered FIRE, and was like ""holy shit"" this is it! I jammed everything into a simple three fund index-based portfolio of US Equity/Foreign Equity/Bonds.

I kept working (way less) for almost 2 years after that, but everything mentally changed. Suddenly, once the monetary excitement was stripped from doing work, all the other pluses felt...dull. Like, I can get ""nice hotels"", ""lots of travel"", ""good dinners"" etc... without a job now.

I hit 3.5 million this year and have been taking a break completely from work for 9 months now. Traveling, contemplating, philosophizing, visiting friends, leaning into hobbies/pastimes and honestly trying to figure out what my life means to myself and others now that at a 3.8% SWR, after tax, I can **SPEND/DONATE** $10,000/month forever. That's my needs, wants and then some. Why would I do anything that a boss/client/manager wants me to do when...I don't have to?

I'm at the same mental place a LOT of people get to when they hit their number. The problem is two-fold, One, I used to looove my job and it was a source of lots of excitement in my life. Hard to recreate that with just money, but I also don't feel like doing the work it takes just to get the high status stuff. Two, I don't feel like I deserve this **at all** because I got here earlier with a lucky bet on crypto. I would have definitely gotten here, but maybe in my 40s and I would have felt I actually earned it.

Basically, it feels like I used a cheat code on my life and now I'm not sure how to make it fun again. And don't feel like I ""deserve"" to FIRE. This is such an unrelatable problem, but I thought this nonjudgemental community might have some insights or nuggets of wisdom.",financialindependence
375,The dark side of FIRE that almost broke me,,2460,blzmtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/blzmtb/the_dark_side_of_fire_that_almost_broke_me/,1557281640.0,"When I was at university, my perception of happiness was based on graduating and quitting my ""shitty"" job at the local supermarket.

When I started my corporate career,  I found the FIRE movement, so that perception shifted to wanting to grow my bank account and retire early to work on my side hustle.

When I did FIRE, I was so miserable, it almost broke my spirit.  
------------------------------------------------------------
First I want to extend a big thank you to this community. I have learned so much from here. There are some threads on here where I have read the replies so many times that I almost know them by heart ;) 

**I achieved my FI by**

1.Having a high paid corporate job
 I managed to climb up the corporate ladder in a relatively short time span not because I was so skilled at what I do, but because I have always worked on my social skills. (no that doesn't mean that I sold my ass lol)

2.Investing
I started with a term deposit account then bought gold, then index funds, then individual stocks. The usual except that I also sold stock options which paid me handsomely. 

3.Always having a second source of income from a plethora of side hustles that I had started over the years.
- Dropshipping was the most consistent business I owned.
- Day trading bitcoin was the most profitable.

4.Frugality: This is where my views diverge a little from the common dogma. I just chose not to waste my best years pinching pennies and not doing the things that I want (not necessarily need) to do. Not material things but more experiences.  As an example, travelling has literally changed me as a human being and my net worth could have been a lot bigger without travelling every single year, but I believe that travelling when young is very different than when I have settled down and/or matured. 

**My Story**

Early 2016,  although my net worth by most calculators out there told me that I have to work for at least a few more years before I make these calculators happy, I decided that my safety net is large enough to retire and I am capable of making my side hustle at the very least cover my expenses. So I quit my job. 

The mornings feel so damn different when you are not a corporate slave. Everything seemed more enjoyable from getting coffee in the morning to taking random walks during the day.
I started to enjoy my interactions with others so much more. Maybe the facade of the corporate world had trivialised the small things for me. 

Leaving my corporate job was no excuse for being lazy. I was working 14 hour days on growing my e-com business. and it was definitely paying off.
I was either behind a computer screen, at the gym, or with my girlfriend.

Around 3 weeks in, I started talking to walls as all my friends were at work during the day and I started feeling some loneliness.

I found a job at a local gym. 3 nights a weeks. Working at a gym is something that I have always had on my bucket list. I loved it. It kept me sane.

I started having what Financial Samurai calls an identity crisis. I was good at my job, financially stable. I consider myself a very confident individual. But I hadn’t realised that most of my sense of self worth was tied to my job.
Now that it was gone and everyone around me including my girlfriend were still at work. My self esteem started to suffer.

The gym closed. Now my loneliness was exacerbated. Combine that with a fluttering self esteem. My relationship started to suffer.
I broke up with my girlfriend at the time, 4 months after quitting work. 
I've had many break ups, but I still carry the deep scar of this one as it represented more than a breakup. It represented the collapse my identity that I had built over the years. Viktor Frankl's A man's search for meaning describes this perfectly. I lost my purpose. Now severe depression set in. I cannot describe to you how debilitating that was. I didn't want to do anything. I literally felt that there was an invisible door stopping me from leaving my room, let alone the house. Stopped answering calls let alone talking to other human beings. I didn't even know what day it was and I didn't care. I was prescribed antidepressants and Valium. I refused the antidepressants and on a whim,pushed by my siblings, decided to travel ,alone, for the first time in my life.

A silent retreat in India. Bungee jumping in a dodgy place in Thailand. Learning meditation and yoga. Scuba diving. Catching up with childhood friends and family members across different countries. I started feeling better. So much better very quickly.

Then I went to Bali. I wanted to live the ""nomad"" lifestyle, so I signed up at Hubud and the Dojo (2 renown coworking spaces in the digital nomad community)

This was life changing. One the best experiences in my life. I felt a sense of belonging to a tribe of like minded people. I was so motivated to work because the energy around me was contagious. I closed my e-com store (too many negative emotions attached to it) and started leverage trading bitcoin (on Bitmex). I bought all kinda courses, joined paid groups, newsletters and it did pay off... I was averaging $200-$300 days which is incredible for a noob. 
Imagine waking up, meeting up with friends for breakfast at the beach, going to the co-working space, making money, then having fun at night with your friends.
You know that picture marketers paint in our heads of some dude running a business from his laptop at the beach? That's real. 

Then comes the wake up call. I quickly noticed that people come and go. I would develop friendships (even a great relationship) then a few weeks later, my new found friends would go back home and I'd have to start from scratch. Then the novelty of working from the beach and not answering to a boss started to lose its meaning. Also, the visa run wasn't my favorite thing to do.

At that crossroad, I had a call from a recruiter who had worked with me in the past, about a new alluring opportunity.

My decision was based on this: I can always go back to FIRE but the longer I stay out of the workforce the harder it will be to find a job. 

So I went back to the corporate world. This is not the end of my story as I know that office work will never be a long term option for me. But I had to retreat and regroup for now….

I am as usual working on a side hustle -  I am still trading options.

**Lessons learned**

*I didn’t realise this at the time, but for me now, the end goal of FI isn't necessarily early retirement...but a sense of freedom. I can quit whenever I want which makes work a lot less stressful. Hell, I enjoy my work a lot more now just knowing that.

*Early retirement is still on the agenda, but I will not do it alone. I will make sure that I have a better support system (a business partner / a spouse on the same journey / a team).

*Loneliness is a bitch. I know that there are many introverts like me amongst you, but social isolation can literally KILL you based on multiple studies like https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/1009

*When you shift your paradigm, be psychologically prepared to conquer your demons and centre your self identity. You are not your net worth. You are not your job.

*I understand the gravity of mental diseases a lot more now and I have a massive amount of empathy towards people who suffer from them. 

*Oh, and I have zero regrets. If I were to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. I am grateful for the opportunity to fail and learn from my mistakes.

378,FI saved my job... and got me promoted,,2399,awfaqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/awfaqt/fi_saved_my_job_and_got_me_promoted/,1551511884.0,"Here is a story about how pursuing FI has helped my career. I'm in my early 30s and have around ~$500k saved. My goal is somewhere around $2-3M so I'm not close to retirement but the nest egg is a good start. I actually don't mind my work and enjoy it sometimes but my field has horrible job security which is what prompted me to begin saving. It seems like layoffs happen at least once a year and with a young family I didn't want to be fucked if it happened to me.



I hit $500k saved last year. And like clockwork, the layoff rumors started happening at the beginning of this year. Finally having a sum of money I felt pretty comfortable with, my confidence was high. What's the worst that can happen? They lay me off and I get a severance package, and I have a shitload of money anyway. 


So as soon as I got wind of the rumors I started shamelessly campaigning for a spot on another team that I felt was more strategic to the company. I watched all of our CEO's public strategy statements and put together a presentation that basically regurgitated his ideas and how they tied into why I should be on that other team. 


I'd never have so blatantly tried to find a spot on another team without FI. As it turns out, I not only got onto that team, but as a result of the layoffs and re-org they promoted me to be the MANAGER of that team! Most likely due to my understanding of the company strategy. My previous team was all let go in the layoff and re-org, so if I hadn't done that I would be looking for work.

Certainly I could have done this without FI, but I was totally prepared to lose my job so I didn't feel scared about shamelessly initiating conversations with bosses 2-3 levels above me. And that is what saved me, and got me promoted.

Yes, I have to pay tuition but I'm only taking one class per term (two per year) in order to drag out my degree as long as possible. My classes are $1,125 each and health insurance in the Cigna network costs $1,750. In addition, I've enrolled my partner for dependent coverage at another $1,750 per year. Our plan has a $0 deductible and $6,400 out-of-pocket maximum per individual. Any in-network services are a $20 co-payment or at most 10% coinsurance.

Each year, we receive fantastic coverage and I complete two classes toward a graduate degree for just $5,750.

* Moved to a low cost of living country.

* Lowered my ~~monthly~~ yearly burn rate to 1.2% of my CURRENT (after crash) portfolio. This is necessities and a little teeny tiny tiny bit of recreation/restaurant. Will get better at cooking and most things I like to do cost little money.
* Will continue to live here and keep this withdrawal rate until that withdrawal rate reaches 1% (or in other words until the markets recover 20% (beyond my withdrawals). Then, I'll raise my withdrawals to 2% which will effectively double my current conservative budget.
* Could be months, could be years. I'm young, single and flexible as fuck, so I'd be silly to not take advantage of those things to protect my future self's retirement.
* My pre-FI career is a bit distant after taking a couple years off, but I'm going to seek out some projects if I can get them as people get back to work so that I'm further reducing withdrawals, ideally to zero and, if I'm lucky enough, buy more equities as the markets are depressed.

There have been a number of posts recently of very fortunate people which have been received with everything from incredulity paired with despair to heartfelt congratulations. What a spectrum of emotion! Accusations of humblebragging have reverberated around the sub and it’s altogether been a little too salty for my liking. Let’s start with the basics:    
 


[Graphs]( https://imgur.com/a/xt9i3)

Married, no kids. 30(M), 29(F)  
**Income:** $375k. $275k (me), $100k (DW)  
**Net worth:** $610k   
**Home equity:** $220k   
**Semi-liquid:** $390k. Spread across taxable and non-taxable.  
**FIRE Number:** $2-2.5 million including HE. 


Now that I’m done with my humblebrag, let’s look at what portions of my experience and perspective I can share. If I can do this from my starting point, so can most of us. I am under no doubts that luck has played a large role in my success, but there are number of decisions and risks I took that have been equally important. A number of the seemingly insurmountable barriers that people described are just that.. barriers. You can do it too!  


The above is a one-dimensional view. Let’s look at the barriers on the way:  
>Lower wage job ($25k) in a lower paying country that the US (UK). Check.  
>Degree with poor job prospects (manufacturing). Check.  
>Lower (relatively) income ($75k) in a HCOL (SF Bay area).  
>Single income couple in said area. Check.  
>Student loan debt ($70k). Check  
>Industry that is stagnant, losing jobs and lower paying (manufacturing). Check. 

**Getting a job**  
I graduated in the middle of the recession (2010). TBH it was the best thing that happened to me. Prior to 2010 I was bottom of my class. The raw, primordial fear that the recession introduced into my life changed me from a skirt chasing Counter Strike: Source addict to one of the library’s most studious residents. I had mistakenly studied manufacturing engineering in university, oblivious to larger global trend of automation and the exodus of manufacturing jobs to low cost locations. It was hard, really hard to get a job. My first job paid decent money, $25k, all things considered. I took any advantage I could get to get it- I had to travel for my interview. When I checked into my hotel room, the receptionist told me that my “colleagues” had already checked in. Thinking on my feet, I asked her who they were and what rooms they were in. Turns out, 2 were there to conduct interviews and were in the bar. I dumped my stuff in my room and headed to the bar. We all joked about what a remarkable coincidence it was when all three of us ended up chatting for a few hours! 100% this is why I got the job over the other 200 applicants- I got to connect with them, on a human level, outside of the interview process.  


**Finding a profitable area in a waning industry**  
My early professional life was plagued by a sense of impending doom. I knew I had to do something differently if I wanted to avoid building a career in a dead end industry. Despite my efforts, I couldn’t get into a different industry, so I started to look into the areas of manufacturing less likely to go to a cheaper location. Anything where the value is derived from IP (Pharma, medical devices), government contracts (defence) or major capital equipment (trains, planes). I landed a job in medical devices, $35k at a US multinational. At this stage of my life, I lived on $10k a year with a savings rate of ~60%. I didn’t heat my room, never had AC, I never ate out. My food budget was $25 / week for groceries and $20 / week for subsidized meals at work. Video games kept me sane. I studied at night time to pick up certifications in statistics and business to broaden my skillset.  


**Engineering a relocation**   
In 2012 I went on a business trip to the US. I was dumbfounded. My peers in the States were earning 3x what I was and paying less tax. Not only that, but progression was fast! There were managers and directors in their thirties. I was sick with envy. It was a visceral feeling that hijacked my emotions for weeks! And like that, I decided I HAD to go the US. It was the only option for me. I applied for every single posting I could find in my company and was uniformly rejected. New grad with 2 years’ experience? No chance. Then I found out that an important VP was visiting our plant. I begged my friend, an administrative assistant, for his schedule. She eventually relented. **Pro tip:** Admins are gatekeepers and have huge amounts of important information. Always be on their good side! I researched his career and then “happened” to be in the elevator at the same time as him and delivered an elevator pitch. Just like that, he scheduled a follow up call with me, which led to some other calls. 3 weeks later I left everything behind and landed in San Francisco airport. Salary was $74k.  


**Stuck in rut, but still saving**  
Fast forward 3 years and I’m horribly unhappy. The manufacturing site I’m in has 30%+ attrition and has laid people off. It is disproportionately staffed by low paid visa workers who cannot leave. Compensation is generally 20-40% below market. Thankfully, I did not sacrifice my life for work and I’m in a very happy and meaningful relationship with my future wife, who kept me sane. We were living together and subsisting on one income as she was in graduate school. Total expenses for 2013 and 2014 were $40k and $42k respectively. This was very challenging in the Bay Area. I don’t know how parents support children on that level of income here. They must be budget ninjas! We had a good deal on rent ($1,650 for a studio) which we got by being the first at every showing (usually 7AM), and being willing to sign a lease on the spot.  

We got married ($16k, 80 people). Happiest day of my life. $16k was a small price to pay for such an amazing day. We made all the decorations and married at a restaurant- cheaper as their business model is to provide food and seating together. Surprising how expensive it is to pay two different companies for each separately. My biggest regret was paying the included 18% service fee but leaving no additional tip. There’s being frugal and there is being cheap. I cringe every time I think of it as the staff were fantastic. DW had $70k of debt from her undergrad and master’s degrees. Refinanced at 6.8% and put everything we could towards it.  DW got an excellent job in healthcare, income is relatively fixed around $100k for.. well forever. Her job and income are much more stable than mine, which is nice.  


**Know your worth and take risk**  
Green card came through (did the paperwork ourselves to save $3k+ in lawyer’s fees) and I started job hunting. I was desperate to leave. I was shouted out, called names, lied to and promised a promotion that never came. I knew I was in the hottest job market in the country, one where big risk is rewarded and failure is accepted. I found a company that I really liked the look of. Product was good, financials were healthy and growth prospects were excellent. I found a contact who worked there and got her to refer me instead of me applying. Why? Interviews are an extended negotiation. Having a narrative that “they found you” gives you much more leverage than the other way around. Interviewed, they made me an offer as a level individual contributor with a 20%+ pay increase. I turned it down. What? Yup, I turned it down. When you are negotiating, it is important to know your worth. We had a NW of ~$140k at the time, so I knew I could quit my job and be unemployed if I had to so I took the gamble they’d offer me something better. Two months passed and they rang me back to say they had changed their organization structure around to create a management position for me and offered me the job, I took it. Total comp that year for me was $130k.  

Jumping ahead to now, I’ve been through two promotions and the company has done very, very well. Salary is $155k, the rest is bonus and equity. Still in manufacturing, compensation can be good in any industry. It’s just a question of *where (or how high)* you have to go in a company to find it. Average compensation sucks for most in manufacturing.  


**TL;DR and general advice:** 

Everyone reading this has decent analytical and financial skills (thank you FIRE community). These are real skills, parlay them into your work.   

Learn to read a balance sheet and P&L account. Be mindful of who you work for by understanding their product, market and financials. It is much, much easier to progress in a growing company.  

Focus on value and impact. Don’t focus on the task you are doing. Seems simple, but it is amazing how many people do something because they’ve been told to do so without understanding what they are trying to achieve. Pursue further education to do so.  
  
Luck is important. The ability to recognize opportunity and take advantage of it is even more important. Or “creating” your own lucky situations. See above examples.  

Relocate if necessary.  

Make sure your spouse has shared values. Mine does and everything we do is a team effort!  

No barriers are insurmountable, it is just a question of it of what it takes to overcome it and if it’s worth it. If you think you can’t do something, you can’t.  

**Edit:** Some thoughts on skills and doing MSc's or Phd's. True value tends not to come from deep knowledge of one skill, but the intersection of several. It is much rarer and you can add much more value as a result. Rather than become an expert in something, I've gone around and picked up a few complementary things and built an extremely competitive skillset. 

**Edit:** Appreciate all the kind comments. I'm just a regular dude, I'm not anything special.  I never, ever thought I'd break 100k in income. I use to despair at how unachieveable the salaries I'd see in this sub were.  Regular people can chase FIRE and be successful. That's what this community is about. Anyone can do it!

A coworker, probably in her late 40’s, asking another coworker about the same age, how to transfer all her stock to bonds on the 401k website. The second coworker then describes click by click how to do it, while also getting rather angry at her (as a friend) for not doing it earlier as she had done. 

“YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF STOCKS NOW” she almost yelled. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The market at that point was down around 20%?  And here this person was about to eliminate a substantial amount of what could potentially be her life’s savings.  And her friend presumably had already done the same. 

The more I thought about it, the more depressing it got.  I realized they could have possibly done the same thing a number of times in the past.  Each time they could have exited the downturn with much less than they’d started with. If they were still in stocks at this point, they must buy back into stocks at some point after the carnage.  And all this essentially represents how they understand the markets, and how they believe one should invest.  And it made me realize how scared someone like that must be about their investments and retirement, to think that at any time, the markets could tank and you simply just loose years of savings because of it, nothing you can do about it.  

Anyways, for a bit I attributed this to them simply not being that bright.  But I began to think, what if I didn’t have groups like these?  What if I didn’t have smarter people crunching the numbers, running the projections, doing unbiased research (hopefully lol), that I so easily get to benefit from?  What if the only access I had to financial advise was through some shady financial advisor company or some relative?  I could have been like them. 

Anyways, just thought I’d share. One of those moments that just blow you away and make you incredibly grateful at the same time.",financialindependence

[My first post - a 1 year in reflection + FIRE story](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b2bfko/fire_1_year_in_a_few_reflections/)

[And my 2 year follow up here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/etgc2q/fire_2_years_in_a_few_more_reflections/)

I’m a patient person, a future-oriented person, and these characteristics helped me to persist in the long-term planning I did when I was working towards FI/RE. It helped me hold on to my investment in crypto as it soared (Stick to your plan, man: I took some profits, which is how I jumped the queue to FIRE earlier than expected and with more than I needed, though I was heavy on the FI/RE path before that). 

I am also a semi-rational person (I think), who has played out a number of scenarios in my head many times. In fact – I had to do that to feel confident to retire in the first place. What if ____ (fill in catastrophic thing) happens?… each time I figured out how I would survive and most of the survival plans fell out to: keep cool and sit tight (a couple of them included “and go back to work.”) Considering how the stock market and economy in general are cyclical, I had gone through the “what do you do when there is a crash and your net worth drops significantly?” (note the crash part is not “if”, but “when”). The answer, as previously mentioned, was “sit on the porch and watch your sunflowers grow.”  

There was a conversation in (I think) one of my posts last year where after the market had dropped a small amount I mentioned I had just chilled through it (while others flipped out and panic-sold and were then kicking themselves) and someone on here snarkily replied “well, wait until you see a REAL drop, then we will see what you do!” 

Well Snarko VonSnarkington, this post is for you. 

As you might recall, the month of March was brutal, with many days showing huge losses in the stock markets. Not only did the market drop precipitously but my historically uncorrelated asset bitcoin shit the bed as well (a universal rush to cash?) leaving me just over $1M poorer net-worth-wise. 

My portfolio consists of real estate (my old house that I now rent out), index funds, and bitcoin. I outright own my current house (sold my bond funds to buy the house) and a piece of shit truck that I love. I also own a cat free and clear. 

So what did I do as my portfolio took a double barreled shotgun to the face?!?!? Not a goddamn thing. Ok, that’s a lie. I loss-harvested 90k worth of index funds which have since recovered and then some. I held tight. I held strong. I built shelves for my workshop out of salvaged lumber. 

Psychologically I have to say I felt off – it was not fun, and it was not Zen (though I tried brother, I tried). I had to argue with myself “well, this is one of those situations that test your mettle, meboyo…” and “wow, how is this going to play out… nervous… yuck…” but even though I experienced emotions, there was never even the option in my mind to sell in order to protect capital. It never appealed to me as a wise option and I had no compulsion to do so. For years I have made an informed decision to commit to this strategy I believe in, and damnit I am going to stick by it. I own my house. I know how to cook. I have health insurance and a rainy-day fund. I am retired, by design, because I stick to the plan until it no longer makes any sense – and this was a case where it looked like things were going to be ok (maybe it will take 3 years, but ok nonetheless). I had no idea we would see a stock/crypto recovery so quickly. 

By the end of this August when I updated my monthly spreadsheet, I had crossed back above where I was just before the crash. As of last week  my net worth is 10% higher than it was before the crash.  I also used the confusion in the marketplace in April to buy a beautiful old house to live in (and it has a huge detached workshop!) in a new, lower COL city (with cash, at a discount).

Who the hell knows what happens next with this economy, politics, health, meteors, and the old Gods of Cthulu, but I’ve got one “been there, done that” under my belt now and I feel like I played it well by not playing at all. If anyone is looking for me, I’m out back in the workshop, making smoke and dust and a general mess as I teach myself woodworking and metalworking to enhance my primitive art constructs. 

Feel free to ask any questions, and when shit gets weird, remember to breathe.

Her family was able to get by but money was always tight, financial independence was never on their timeline. That isn't a bad thing, but it sets up the story to come. My mother in law now works part time but would rather be home most days, their youngest is 19yo now. They have a tight sense of family; 19yo, 22yo, and 27yo plus 27yo fiancé are all under one room with the inlaws. My wife is the only one who lives on her own, with me.

I work for the feds and there is a excellent daycare, run by employees of my facility, on site where I work that is both very affordable and good for the kids who go there. Lots of activities, the teach the kids sign language, reading, etc. My wife is a healthcare professional who's starting income is about 160k/year and she's planning on going back to work next week. To help with her schedule and my schedule, we were planning on putting our kids in day care (under 2yo) for TWO days a week, 5hrs a day. Nothing crazy. Our goal is to pay off our house in the next year and a half before the 3rd kid comes. Great. 

Fast forward to last night, my wife is talking to her parents about the situation and the day care idea comes up. My wife explains our situation about wanting to pay off the house and her parents lay into her about being selfish and ridiculous. ""Why can't you be normal and raise your kids the way we did?!"" ""Everybody pays their house off in 30 years, why do you have to do it differently?"" ""Why do you have to do this to our grandchildren?"" I could continue but you see the point.

Last week in the daily we had a good little talk about the letter I had written to my wife that details certain emergency money measures.  The talk was so good, I decided to spin up a post on it.  This is that post.

The letter covers three contingencies that I think could happen where I wouldnt be able to manage our money.

* Short term (like I am on a business trip)

* Long term (like I am in a coma or brain damaged)

* Dead (this is permanent)  

I sent a copy to here gmail where she will keep it forever and be able to find it by searching for ""emergency money"" and I also have a card copy in this little [fireproof box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IPR22C/) we bought on Amazon a couple years back.  Here is the letter (names changed and screenshots removed)

>**Short Term:**

>1.  Use the normal credit card to buy stuff as needed.

>2.  Make sure all bills are paid.  Everything is basically automatic and pays from our credit card or Ally .  We should have enough at Ally to last at least 4-6 months

>3.  Pay our rent.

>**Long Term or Bad situation:**

>Note: Our emergency funds should last at least three years (probably more!) under normal-world circumstances.  You can ask my dad for advice.  After my dad, I would recommend Matt, Mike, and then Brad for advice.

>1.  Immediately sign up for two (or more) of the 0% credit cards like you have done before.  Call and get the best credit limit you can.  Use those for as many purchases as you can to conserve cash. 

>2.  Follow short term steps 2 and 3 above. 

>3.  If/when Ally savings is exhausted, sell our stocks and bonds in our shared Vangaurd account which is called ""OracleDBA's super time awesome brokerage""

>   3a.  Log on to Vanguard with your username/password.

>   3b.  Sell only what you need to satisfy cash needs.

>   3c.  The order in which you sell is important.  Sell whatever has the highest long-term capital gain first.

>   3c-1 once logged in go to cost basis-in the brokerage account

>   3c-2 in the cost basis screen, click show details to expand all the holdings and then sell whichever holding has the highest LONG-TERM capital gain.  This should correspond to the lowest cost per share for that holding.

>   3d.  On the sell screen, you can have the proceeds of the sale sent to our Ally checking or savings.

>   3e.  Vanguard is really nice and you can call them if you need help with these instructions.  Also, the forum bogleheads.org is really nice if you need to ask questions about the right way to sell.

>4.  If things are really bad or really long term, take time and hire a fee-only financial advisor. 

>5.  Don't forget my long term disability which kicks in after 180 days!  That shit pays out $4100/month until I am 65.  If you have to claim my disability insurance, hire a lawyer who knows how to do that.  Also talk to the lawyer about social security disability.

>**OracleDBA's dead:**

>1.  Follow the short term steps 1-3 and also probably get some 0% cards until everything is figured out.

>2.  Hire a lawyer and ""fee-only"" financial advisor.  Get advice from my Dad, Matt, Mike, and/or Brad.

>3.  In the black fire-proof box is a list of all the institutions in which I/we have money and insurance.

>4.  Our wills are in gmail and the notarized one is on our safe deposit box.

>5.  Congrats! you are a millionaire!  P.S. go get a bunch of therapy and shit.

That's the letter!   She found it very simple and reasonable.  I have many further things to share regarding this.  

First, some of you may question why I instructed her to sell to lock in gains.  I did this because explaining when it might be appropriate to tax-loss harvest would be cumbersome.  Plus, given our holdings and tax situation, it makes sense.  If it ever doesn't make sense, I will update the instructions.

Second, I do go to great lengths to share all and any financial details with my wife.  Her background is completely different than mine and she has very little interest in finances.  She delegates financial stuff to me.  You may have a different relationship/understanding with your spouse and that is awesome.   

Third, I have a bunch of insurance (life insurance through my job) and a private (really good) long-term disability policy that I mention in this letter.  That might be a **really good idea for you** and you should think long and hard about what would happen if you die or become disabled.

Lastly, I wrote this in accordance with my circumstances and beliefs.  Yours might be totally different!  My reason for posting this whole fucking thing was maybe to help you mangs thing about how your bankroll might be handled if certain crazy things in your life might happen.  It is worth thinking about and preparing for.  

Edit: 

**Bonus Points:** A few things have come up in this thread that are important.

You should probably have a will and advance directive.  Go see a lawyer.  

You should probably have disability insurance and maybe life insurance.

You should for sure list a beneficiary or Transfer On Death in all of your financial accounts.

387,Study: How the year you are born impacts your path to FIRE,,2326,9uefx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9uefx7/study_how_the_year_you_are_born_impacts_your_path/,1541431669.0,"I am a complete nerd when it comes to finances, and programming. Since I couldn't find a simulator to answer the title question, I decided to seek out answering it myself using Shiller's data. The idea is one that is obvious at face value but one that I think a lot of people can't quite wrap their minds around... that is, the market ebb and flow directly impacts our FIRE plans much more than we think. To use an analogy, if you're putting a boat into the ocean... running out when the water is receding can get you there much faster/smoother than deciding to run into the water as it's peaking on the shore and dealing with a shallow launch. The ocean is easy to anticipate in these situations, however the markets we watch... not so much. Getting out of the market when we're in a recession is ideal... though usually the opposite happens and we bail after a bull, just in time for the market to recede. 

I wrote this a couple years ago and will update the numbers to include that last two years if people are interested... I can also make the salaries and savings rates a bit more aggressive (30%, 40%, 50%) to match what many in the FIRE community are working towards. Let me know your thoughts. It's all just variables in the program, easy to adjust :)

===

I came up with this first pass simplistic model, to outline what a difference a decade can make in when you started your working career. I'm fascinated by this, although it doesn't come as any surprise that getting horrible returns (or a recession) just before retirement would be a bad thing, it is still interesting to think that our ability (or rather the ease at which we get there) to create financial freedom from the market also depends on factors outside of our control.   


Modeling Wealth Accumulation:  


In this example I decided to explore what happens when a person consistently saves over their career. For this one I decided to make this accumulation phase 40 years (which could roughly correlate to someone starting to work at 22 and retiring at 62). I could tweak these numbers (and will in future models) but decided to just keep it simple for this first pass. So in this example we will assume the following:  


* Starting Salary (in 2016 dollars) $30,000; individual saves 15% of salary every year for 40 years  

* Annual salary raises of inflation + 1.25% (which would bring the persons salary to $48,699 at the age of 62, in 2016 dollars)  

* (CPI) numbers are used in order to factor out inflation - or bring all examples to 2016 dollars. This allows us to compare market conditions in 1880s (using 2016 dollars) based on the above assumptions, to get apples to apples comparison of performance. Basically, we're not looking at the actual growth of your money in real value, but rather the growth minus inflation... or what your buying power would increase to. (It does no good to say today... yay I'll have $1,000,000 in retirement in 2050... if things cost twice as much in 2050 as they do today, then it's be better to think of that as you'll actually only have $500,000 in 2016 dollars once you reached 2050.  


**Results:**

Over a career of 40 years with an initial salary of $30,000 (2016 dollars) and a 1.25% raise each year, setting aside 15% of your salary towards retirement... you would have set aside a total of $231,703 (2016 dollars) into your retirement account. The worst year to have started working would have been 1881, because a combination of inflation an lackluster market conditions in 1915-1920 would conspire to inhibit your retirement account as it reached the finish line. Despite 40 years of compounding and growth, you'd end up with just $370,769 in 2016 dollars (knowing what we know about the great depression... you'd likely experience a roller coaster in retirement as you'd see your account skyrocket in the 20's only to CRASH hard in 1929). It's no wonder my great grandfathers generation was so conservative when it came to investing. Their parents lived this, and they grew up in that environment.  


The best year to have started your career would have been 1926, makes sense that starting your accumulation phase just as the depression hit would award you a starting point of buying equities on extreme sale. This is why people shouldn't run from recession markets but rather embrace them for the discount that they are. Strong market conditions in the late 60's led this person to a final figure of $2,110,297  


Another interesting point is just how big a difference a few years can make... based on when you started accumulating. Someone who started working in 1968 would have seen their retirement account grow to $1,228,427 by 1998... but someone starting just two years later would have ended up with $692,122 because the last year before retirement they would have been hit by the dot com bust.  


That's an anomaly, the median result of that kind of accumulation period is to end up somewhere in the $900K-$1.1M range. About half of all results fell in that range. But there were periods of time where the market continuously was above it... example starting your career between 1912 and 1934 always left you with above $1.1 million... and a median return around $1.7 million, with four of the cycles ending with above $2 million.  


This brings me to an important point about this model... it's not all that ideal because people tend to move towards more conservative investments (introducing bonds) as they get closer to retirement. I'm going to track down the inflation adjusted bond return numbers and create an Asset Allocation situation for my next model that will follow this framework but have someone shift slowly towards more conservative investments in the later years of their accumulation phase. Also, what ends up happening is that people who don't quite have enough just work a few years longer... so the strict 40 years isn't all that realistic... but still helps to hammer down the point that even if you're diligent with savings, the market factors still dictate a bit of when you can actually pull the plug on working.  


What might be more meaningful is to look at how many years (from each start date) it takes to accumulate say $1.5M by saving 15% of your salary every year (using the above figures 15% savings of a $30K salary that grew to $48,699 over your career -- all figures adjusted for inflation to be in today's dollars).

What I found particularly remarkable about these results is that someone who started working in 1931 setting aside 15% of their modest pay reached $1.5M in just 34 years... while someone who started just 3 years later in 1934 had to work an extra 15 years longer to achieve the same level of financial security. A combination of inflation in the 70's and a 50% surge in the market in 1933 that got the compounding started early, created this disparity.\*

&#x200B;

As I mentioned above, I'm open to suggestions on how to change the variables to get a more meaningful study of the market as it would fit the FIRE community. My guess is that a larger savings rate and shorter period of accumulation smooths these figures off a bit, however the actual year you start to save will still have a significant say in how market compounding impacts your FIRE timeline.

With two young children I was forced to evaluate my priorities. Being 38/M/married with $3.2M,
I wanted to make sure that we, meaning the entire family, were happy. 

Because the ability to pick-up and travel would be difficult with the kids for now, I decided to focus on FI. 

I still work, and I’ve honestly gotten better at my job. Because of the lack of fear of getting fired I can swing for the fences. I sell enterprise software and have decided to no longer climb the ladder. I’m making about $150K-$200K depending on the year, but live a lifestyle that I love. I go to the gym and come in late. I’ll take a few long lunches, and typically leave by 4 PM on most days. I still hit all my quotas, but I’m not kissing ass or showing off. I’ve actually started mentoring my coworkers recently when I find they are struggling. 

I leave my laptop at work most nights and don’t answer emails from home. I will check my schedule on Sunday nights to help plan the week. 

My wife and I take a few vacations a year, all paid by salary/bonuses as not to affect my principle in the market. 

I have about 15 years before I really RE, but this lifestyle means I get to enjoy my life until then as opposed to hating life.

I have been running extra hard in the rat race for far too many years (even though some would call me young).  I worked very hard, even working to support myself through college and the grad school. I neglected my health, my friends, and my family along the way.  The COVID quarantine was a wakeup call for me.  It gave me a taste of what life would be like when I didn't have to commute across the city to sit in an office for certain prescribed hours each week.  I'm hooked and I can't go back.

The past several years, I house-hacked and side-hustled my way to FU money and to be honest it came so much faster than I anticipated.  FU money in hand, I've realized that I can't stay in my day job anymore.  I need to be free to do my own thing.  In the next 3-6 months, I'm moving from my M/HCOL city to a much smaller LCOL city near the water.  I just put a cash offer on a house and I hope it gets accepted.  It's a small house that needs work but it's in a safe location near downtown, it's livable, and most importantly in my budget.  I plan on renting out the house I currently own which should cover it's mortgage and give me some cash flow.

Recently, I paid cash for a 4 year old economy car with 48k miles on it which should last me many years so my expenses are going to be very low.  I am looking forward to waking up in the morning, working out, then cooking a healthy breakfast before tackling some home improvement projects in between working for clients at my own work from home business.  When I land a new client, I am going to treat myself with lunch and a couple of beers at my local joint.  Occasionally I'm going to wake up on a Tuesday morning and go to the beach and chill all day because I can.

And I'm going to focus less on myself and more on the people I care about.  I'm not waiting any more.  I'm going to do this now while I can.  I've had friends die in their 20s and relatives live to over 100. You never know when it's the last time you'll ever see someone again.  I'm going to surprise my sister with tickets to her favorite musical artist and take her to a show.  I'm going to visit my old college buddy who is married with a kid and have a few beers.  And I'm going to help my dad restore the classic car he bought which is very similar to his first new car.  I still have my car from high school though it hasn't run in years.  Maybe I can get that fixed up and my dad and I can take our cars to a car show together.

I don't want to stop working.  I have no desire to ever fully retire.  I think as humans, we crave progress.  And progress comes from work.  It's not just satisfying, it's a damn privilege to be able to work.  But you have to work on something that you're passionate about.  I want to invent things.  I want to create things.  I want to design things.  I want to build things.  And most importantly, I want to teach and inspire people to do great things of their own.  This world is far from perfect, but hopefully by the time I'm gone it'll be one step closer.",financialindependence

What’s the use of a front page mostly filled with old daily FI discussion threads? Am I supposed to comb through all of it for a chance I might find a topic that will interest me? I never look at these threads, even if it’s the current one, because they have horrible organization (within itself) and the visibility of the topics is nowhere near the attention a regular post gets, and thus garner a much weaker response from fewer members. 

I’m willing to bet the large majority of redditors that visit do not regularly engage (whether it’s read/lurk or post) in the daily discussions, and there’s a reason for that.

I know the rationale mods gave the last time this was discussed was that they didn’t want the front page to be cluttered. I want to highlight leanfire as a counter example.

Yes, this sub is 5x the size and there’s a risk of some extraneous content, but just like the legal system in America, where it prefers to let a guilty person go free than imprison an innocent one, I rather let shitty topics through than lose one good one to overzealous moderation.

393,$2.5M - A Cautionary Tale,,2291,b9629x,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b9629x/25m_a_cautionary_tale/,1554338446.0,"In the last few days I’ve crossed $2.5M for the first time. The growth to this point has been unexpected, coinciding with moving from an engineering position to management about 9 years ago and a significant windfall from working at a pre-IPO company.

Last fall I reached what I had set as my target FI number, $2.333M. I figured that this was enough to cover an anticipated $70k/year spend at a 3% WR (my spending has historically been around 35-40k, but I was accounting for things that aren’t included in that figure like new cars periodically, taxes, more frequent vacations, health insurance, and more for housing since my mortgage over the last \~10 years has been really cheap and I was in the process of selling my house at that time.) 

It also just so happened that right when I was hitting that number I finally landed a new job after a pretty long search. The timing was great, because I didn’t feel ready to retire at 38 years old, and my thought process was that I could join the new company in a “I’m technically retired and just doing this for fun” mentality. It also didn’t hurt that I have some fears about retiring right at the top of a bubble after a 10 year bull run.

Fast forward about 6 months and, unfortunately, it turns out that I made the wrong choice with the new job. The work is boring, my boss kind of sucks, and I feel like I’m wasting my life in a giant building doing stuff that doesn’t matter. A few years back I would have thought that this is exactly the situation that FIRE is for — I should quit and enjoy my earned flexibility. What I didn’t take seriously enough was that I never spent the time and effort to define what I’m retiring TO. This lack of planning is now haunting me. If I quit, I don’t know what I’ll do. Yes yes, I can read all the books and play all the video games and so on… but I still have too much of my identity tied up in what I “do,” and I’m just not ready to make that leap. I also now wonder if being bored at work is enough reason to give up a really great salary & benefits, even if I have what I need. Flying business class several times a year could easily eat up a lot of my budget and sure sounds nice.

I’m posting this partially because it’s cathartic to write about it, but also as a warning to those of you earlier on the path. Take the “one more year” warnings seriously. Figure out what you’re retiring TO. Have fun along the way. I thought I was doing those things and wasn’t depriving myself too much, but I still allowed work to become too much a part of how I define myself. Don’t be like me. ",financialindependence

395,Realized Freedom Is More Than Money,,2269,koc0i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/koc0i5/realized_freedom_is_more_than_money/,1609510862.0,"A couple of years ago I got into FIRE and was ecstatic, as most of you were the first time you heard about it and realized ""wow, this can actually be done?!"". So of course, saving and investing became a big part of my life. Earlier this year however, something happened in my life and I decided to also start taking care of myself. Went on a diet, started exercising and have so far lost about 30 lbs.

I can now do 5K runs and I don't even feel it. It's nothing now. My goal is to work up to doing half marathons. Anyway, I recently started reflecting on what freedom really means to me. Freedom is not merely being able to give your stupid desk job the finger, or having the ability to spend your time as you wish thanks to material wealth accumulation.

Freedom is thinking about what you'd really like to achieve in life, and then going for it without fear, regret or what anyone else thinks. Freedom isn't having the option to eat cheeseburgers and doritos all the time, even though it technically is. The problem with doing so is that it separates you from the best version of yourself, and the best version of yourself is the freest form of yourself. Think about it:

The best version of yourself is the one YOU want to become. Want to be strong, athletic and have a nice body? Figure out what you need to do to get there. Take advice from guys who have what you want, replicate what they're doing, and eventually refine it such that it works better for you. This can only be done through self-discipline. Self-discipline = freedom, as Jocko Willink puts it.

FIRE is ultimately a mindset. Besides, as Charlie Munger once said: ""life is more than being shrewd at passive wealth accumulation"". Don't get me wrong, keep saving, folks. Just make sure you focus on maximizing your freedom in other areas of life as well. Imagine how freeing it is to be able to run long distances and not have to worry. You can just do it. It takes you places. You see things, scenery, people. You challenge yourself and it makes you feel good afterwards. THAT is true freedom.

397,The Father of Index Funds Sounds a Warning on Index Funds,,2230,a1miwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a1miwu/the_father_of_index_funds_sounds_a_warning_on/,1543532808.0,"TL/DR: Due to the significant growth of index fund use, voting rights and control of public companies are held by an ever shrinking group of index fund managers (Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity, State Street)

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/bogle-sounds-a-warning-on-index-funds-1543504551](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bogle-sounds-a-warning-on-index-funds-1543504551)

There no longer can be any doubt that the creation of the first index mutual fund was the most successful innovation—especially for investors—in modern financial history. The question we need to ask ourselves now is: What happens if it becomes too successful for its own good?

The First Index Investment Trust, which tracks the returns of the S&P 500 and is now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, was founded on December 31, 1975. It was the first “product,” as it were, of a new mutual fund manager, The Vanguard Group, the company I had founded only one year earlier.

The fund’s August 1976 initial public offering may have been the worst underwriting in Wall Street history. Despite the leadership of the Street’s four largest retail brokers, the IPO fell far short of its original $250 million target. The initial assets of 500 Index Fund totaled but $11.3 million—falling a mere 95% short of its goal.

The fund’s struggle for the attention (and dollars) of investors was epic. Known as “Bogle’s folly,” the fund’s novel strategy of simply tracking a broad market index was almost totally rejected by Wall Street. The head of Fidelity, then by far the fund industry’s largest firm, put the kiss of death on his tiny rival: “I can’t believe that the great mass of investors are \[sic\] going to be satisfied with just receiving average returns. The name of the game is to be the best.”

Almost a decade passed before a second S&P 500 index fund was formed, by Wells Fargo in 1984. During that period, Vanguard’s index fund attracted cash inflow averaging only $16 million per year.

Now let’s advance the clock to 2018. What a difference 42 years makes! Equity index fund assets now total some $4.6 trillion, while total index fund assets have surpassed $6 trillion. Of this total, about 70% is invested in broad market index funds modeled on the original Vanguard fund.

Yes, U.S. index mutual funds have grown to huge size, with their holdings doubling from 4.5% of total U.S. stock-market value in 2002 to 9% in 2009, and then almost doubling again to more than 17% in 2018. Even that penetration understates the role of mutual fund managers, as they also offer actively managed funds, and their combined assets amount to more than 35% of the shares of U.S. corporations.

If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large U.S. corporation. Public policy cannot ignore this growing dominance, and consider its impact on the financial markets, corporate governance, and regulation. These will be major issues in the coming era.

Three index fund managers dominate the field with a collective 81% share of index fund assets: Vanguard has a 51% share; BlackRock, 21%; and State Street Global, 9%. Such domination exists primarily because the indexing field attracts few new major entrants.

Why? Partly because of two high barriers to entry: the huge scale enjoyed by the big indexers would be difficult to replicate by new entrants; and index fund prices (their expense ratios, or fees) have been driven to commodity-like levels, even to zero. If Fidelity’s 2018 offering of two zero-cost index funds has established a new “price point” for index funds, the enthusiasm of additional firms to create new index funds will diminish even further. So we can’t rely on new competitors to reduce today’s concentration.

Most observers expect that the share of corporate ownership by index funds will continue to grow over the next decade. It seems only a matter of time until index mutual funds cross the 50% mark. If that were to happen, the “Big Three” might own 30% or more of the U.S. stock market—effective control. I do not believe that such concentration would serve the national interest.

My concerns are shared by many academic observers. In a draft paper released in September, Prof. John C. Coates of Harvard Law School wrote that indexing is reshaping corporate governance, and warned that we are tipping toward a point where the voting power will be “controlled by a small number of individuals” who can exercise “practical power over the majority of U.S. public companies.” Professor Coates does not like what he sees, and offers tentative policy options—some necessary, often painful to contemplate. His conclusion—“The issue is not likely to go away”—is unarguable.

Solutions to resolve the issues connected with the concentration of corporate ownership are not self-evident, but a number of tentative possibilities have already been advanced:

• More competition from new entrants to the index field. For the reasons noted above, this eventuality seems highly unlikely.

• Force giant index funds to spin off their assets into a number of separate entities, each independently managed. Such a drastic step would—and should—face near-insurmountable obstacles, for it would create havoc for index investors and managers alike.

• Require index funds to hold just one company in any industry. Leaving aside the dubious ability of either academia or federal bureaucrats to define precisely what constitutes a given industry, such a drastic change would lead to the destruction of today’s S&P 500 index fund, by common agreement, the most beneficial innovation for investors of the modern age.

• Timely and full public disclosure by index funds of their voting policies and public documentation of each engagement with corporate managers. This would take today’s transparent and constructive governance practices several steps further.

• Require index funds to retain an independent supervisory board with full responsibility for all decisions regarding corporate governance. The problem with this idea is that it is not clear how such a board could add to the present scrutiny of the fund’s independent directors.

• Limit the voting power of corporate shares held by index managers. But such a step would, in substance, transfer voting rights from corporate stock owners, who care about the long-term, to corporate stock renters, who do not... an absurd outcome.

• Enact federal legislation making it clear that directors of index funds and other large money managers have a fiduciary duty to vote solely in the interest of the funds’ shareholders. While I believe that such a fiduciary duty is implicit today, making it explicit, with appropriate penalties for violations, would be a constructive step.

It is time for public officials to consider the pros and cons of these issues with indexers, the financial community, academia, and active managers alike—and develop national policies that support high standards of corporate governance. It will require their working together constructively and cooperatively.

But one thing seems crystal clear. Even if present trends continue (sometimes they don’t), the enormous value of index funds should not be ignored. First, index funds provide investors with the most effective stock-market strategy of all time: buy American business and hold it forever, and do so at rock-bottom cost. Second, index funds are among the few truly long-term owners of stocks—for all practical purposes, permanent owners of capital—an enormously valuable asset to society. The long-term focus of index funds is a much needed counterweight to the short-termism favored by so many market participants.

Prof. Coates agrees that nothing should jeopardize the existence of today’s index funds.

“Indexing has created real and large social benefits in the form of lower expenses and greater long-term returns for millions of individuals investing directly or indirectly for retirement,” he writes. “A ban on indexing would clearly not be a good idea.” I can only say, “Amen” to those words.

Living below your means to ""purchase"" future freedom is liberating.

Learning to not find happiness in possessions is liberating.

As is learning to not judge your success or worth by the home you live in or the car you drive.

And seeing the ridiculous fallacy of goods that provide little more than status (i.e. diamonds & other precious gems/metals) puts you several laps ahead of the competition.

It doesn't matter whether you're full-steam ahead on FIRE or just nibbling on the FIRE cake to get a wee bit more utility out of your crumbs...taking more control over your financial life is liberating.

But...just because this works for you, doesn't mean it works for everyone else.

From asking for advice on convincing your partner to think like you to shitting your fucking diaper like a baby over what some rich bitch named Suze Orman thinks to whinging on and on about your brother-in-law spending money like he's shopping prizes at the end of Wheel-of-Fortune in the 1980s...way too many people in here are getting way too bent out of shape regarding other people's life decisions.

Believe it or not, some people are happy as fuck working their brains out to become rich and buy all that bullshit that you have no interest in having. Some people truly do find satisfaction in buying high-end fashion or ridiculous accessories that cost as much as a low-end used car.

I think this stuff's dumb.

But I allocate zero shits to worrying about what my friends & family and strangers do with their lives and money.

Getting worked up about someone on TV claiming you need $200,000/year in retirement is just as silly as homophobes angry that Dave wants to marry Don and not Dawn.

&#x200B;

I intentionally made a throwaway as I did not want to give too many details about myself or my fiance but based on the responses to the post and how it blew up I thought this sub might benefit from getting some perspective.

&#x200B;

Thanks for all the response some were very helpful & positive, some were unfortunately unsurprisingly misogynistic, but the reason I am writing this follow up is to give some perspective to the people that were so quick to judge based on the sole fact of someone being 35 having a 1.5MM net worth vs 0 net worth. Many people couldn't even understand how someone could be 35 and have no net worth. This story will have 2 parts mine, the diligent saver, and my fiancee's the apparently financially irresponsible, party girl.

&#x200B;

I am a first generation Canadian born to working middle class immigrant parents who provided me with a life with basically no wants.While at university I was lucky enough to have a friend to introduce me to FI as a concept and that is when I began planning to RE. When I graduated I had about 40k in loans, I lived with my parents for 2 years while I paid off my loans until I moved out.  During this time, my father became ill and was in and out of hospitals for  about a year. Thankfully since we had universal healthcare the only turmoil we as a family suffered was emotional.  Shortly after my father's recovery I moved abroad, worked in a country with minimal income tax (below 10%),  was paid a salary in USD (yay for the USD to CAD exchange rate), had my housing covered by my employer, and I quickly accumulated the bulk of my net worth. This resulted in having a 1.5MM NW at age 35.

&#x200B;

My fiancee is a first generation American born to a poorer pair of immigrant parents. She too went to university and accumulated some student loans (about 25k) but fewer than me thanks to her scholarships. She was working towards her CPA when her father became ill. Her father had a neurological event that caused him to require a permanent caregiver, his mental faculties were severely compromised and he could basically no longer function on his own. He required multiple operations, months of rehab and a part time caregiver for when his wife, or one of his 2 daughters could not be at home. Since my fiancee is American her family was saddled with 6 figure medical debt. In addition to this my fiancee stalled her career as well. While nobody would think to fire someone due to their family going through a terrible time, my fiancee did have to work closer to a 9-5 (in order to be there for her father) at an accounting firm. This would severely limit any opportunities at promotions as any accountants can vouch during the busy season you basically live at the office in your early career and nobody wants a higher up who isn't willing to commit to the company. A few years ago her father passed and the final financial death knell to my fiancee's net worth was dealt with funeral costs. This is on top of all the years of hardship and emotional turmoil she has gone through. Now that my fiancee has had time to come to terms with the loss of her father she has been able to make great strides in her career, able to move up in a different firm and has significantly increased her salary as well. She was able to slowly pay off her family's debts and become debt free with a net worth of 0, this was also while helping take care of her mother and younger sister.

&#x200B;

Why am I telling you all of this? In the comments of my original post I was lauded as a financially responsible FIRE focused individual when my only real obstacles were student loans and the emotional struggle of my father's illness. I started FI at 3rd base and was congratulated for running to home and reaching RE. My fiancee was labeled irresponsible, a party girl, and worse. In reality, she had to climb through the minors and reach the majors to just have a chance at bat for FIRE.

&#x200B;

I was and am incredibly lucky, had my country not had universal healthcare, had I not met my friend to introduce me to FIRE so early in life, had I been limited in where I could go to further my career I would not have reached FIRE so quickly.

&#x200B;

This sub is one of the most privileged I have ever seen and I do not say this in a bad way. I suspect many of the people who could not understand how an individual can have a low net worth at 35, have most likely led a relatively privileged life as I have. I recommend before we judge anyone based solely for having a low net worth, we may want to realize that not everyone is lucky enough to have a high paying career, low expenses or even basic physical health. Hopefully this post provides some perspective for those who think they can infer all they need to know about a person based only on their financial situation.

&#x200B;

This will most likely be my final post on this account so I wish all of you the best on your own FIRE journeys.

401,I stopped caring about FIRE the instant I RE'd,,2197,gyicip,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gyicip/i_stopped_caring_about_fire_the_instant_i_red/,1591557115.0,"I discovered FIRE about 6 or 7 years ago. At first, I was obsessed with it. I read all the blogs, tried all the super-frugal tips, made plenty of excel spreadsheet projections, checked my investment balance daily, etc. But after a while, it became repetitive and my interest waned. There really wasn't much to this whole FIRE thing. But no matter how boring or repetitive the content on this sub was, I checked it every day because my thoughts always drifted back to FIRE.

FIRE was hope for me. Every day I woke up and as my consciousness miraculously reconstituted itself and I recalled who I was, where I was, and what I'd soon be doing with this precious and limited gift of life I'd once again been granted, there was a 5 out of 7 chance my first thought would be ""*Oh god...not another one of these...*"" My job was miserable, but the people who set the salary knew it was miserable and paid appropriately high amounts in order to keep some poor schmuck doing it. The dominant, rational part of me rejected changing careers or fields. *Maximizing your earnings is the most efficient way to minimize your career length. You can endure this!* So whenever work became too much to bear, I always found myself fantasizing about FIRE. The day I could buy my freedom. The day I would own myself.

Somehow I made it six years on pure fumes and cynicism. Looking back, I'm not sure how I did it. I'd always planned to make a ""I just RE'd!"" post here and get told to go fuck myself. But the moment I retired I just allowed myself to be swept up by life. I let my whims guide me for the first time in over a decade, rather than carefully rationing out available time. I started doing things I ""didn't have time for"" before. I started writing for fun, I paid more attention to relationships I'd been neglecting, I played the same video game 3 times through back to back just because I wanted to, I went down wikipedia rabbit holes for hours, I and a friend became obsessed with a board game and sunk over 100 hours into it (and counting), etc etc.

Today was the first time since I RE'd two months ago that I remembered that I used to be really into FIRE. *Used to*. As soon as my career was out of the picture and my hope was realized, I had no further reason to fantasize - I was living it. Upon returning to this sub and browsing through these familiar-looking threads, I found they held no appeal to me. If anything, they make me feel uneasy. They remind me of a bleaker time.

I'm not sure if I made a mistake. Maybe I'd have been better off on the whole if I'd taken a lower-paid, less miserable job. Maybe it would've made those years easier to bear. But if I did that, I wouldn't be retired right now. And I wouldn't wake up each weekday with a smile, deeply appreciating just how lucky I am.",financialindependence
402,"35/m + 32/f + no kids with $1.65m net worth, semi-retiring",,2193,9qohfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9qohfj/35m_32f_no_kids_with_165m_net_worth_semiretiring/,1540297702.0,"Well, it didn't happen exactly how I envisioned it, but my wife and I are semi-retiring. I've worked for a startup for the past several years but they are cutting costs and shifting directions and I just don't have it in me to see that through over potentially several more years. Plus most of my stock options are vested and exercised so I've already captured most of the upside. My wife isn't thrilled with her job either and our lease is ending so we decided the time was right to leave. We are very lucky to be able to live for a while in her parents' vacation home that they don't use any more and sits empty 95% of the year, so we won't have to pay rent.

Our current combined net worth is about $1.65 million. However, about $100k of that is illiquid startup stock. It also includes a rental property in a HCOL area with a value of close to $900k but a mortgage of close to $400k. The rest is cash and investments. Ignoring the startup stock and subtracting $125k for closing costs and taxes on selling the rental property (which we plan to do in the next few years), that gives FIRE assets of about $1.4 million. We were hoping to get closer to $1.6 million because at a 3.5% withdrawal rate we should be able to spend $40k per year indefinitely and still have ~$400k to buy a house in a MCOL area.

I was initially planning to do part-time contract work for my startup, but they offered a low rate (below my current effective rate) and refused to negotiate, so out of principle I decided to pass. But I'm confident I can fairly easily pick up a decent amount of consulting work through various contacts in my field. This should help bridge the gap until I'm sure we can fully retire.

Ignoring housing, we currently spend about $15k/year, so I have no doubt we'll be able to support that and continue saving. Health insurance is a big question mark, but we are both relatively healthy and I'm less pessimistic than many on this sub. Our unsubsidized premiums will be about $7-9k/year for a bronze plan. Of course, if our income ends up low enough, we should get subsidies.

I'm very excited for this next phase in our lives. As long as I've been working, I've felt like I'm very efficient, and when I get my work done for the day I want to go home and relax instead of having to come up with stuff to do, or worse, try to look busy. On the other hand, I can't say I'm not at least a little anxious about not having somewhere to go every weekday, and the structure that instills. I don't necessarily have huge plans for all the newfound free time, but I'm hoping to get more exercise (including taking up biking), read, and finally watch some movies that I've been meaning to for a while. I'm also very excited about being able to hike or go to the grocery store in the middle of a weekday!",financialindependence

&#x200B;

I'm a 30 year old lawyer in SF, and I feel completely inadequate.  Like many lawyers, I ended up in this profession with a very poor understanding of what lawyers actually do.  I work with some of the hottest and most innovative companies in the world, but I find the work to be dull and hate my secondary role.  I'm not building, creating, or leading - our clients see us as a cost center, and with my billing rate I can't blame them.  My salary is nothing to sneeze at, but in the Bay Area I am middle-class at best.  Every week, I read about some whiz-kid who raised $100m to change the world, and my soul dies a little inside as I stay up late into the night checking some mundane agreement for double periods (a slight exaggeration, but you get the point).

&#x200B;

Here is my dilemma: In addition to hating my job, I'm not very good at it, and I don't have a lot of confidence in my future earning potential. At the same time, I am scared of losing this job and being seen as a failure in the eyes of my friends and family.  I grew up fairly well-off, and while many of my friends and classmates in banking, medicine, and tech seem to have a bright future, I cannot say the same.

&#x200B;

This feeling led me spiraling into depression when I first started practicing three years ago.  I spent a small fortune on school, only to end up in a profession where you work crazy hours just to get by.  As you get more senior, the hours get worse and many partners end up bitter and jaded for having mortgaged their 20s and 30s for a relatively ""low ceiling.""

&#x200B;

This is where FIRE comes in.  When I was in the pits of my depression, I stumbled across MMM.  While I am not a mustachian, I was intrigued by the idea that you could leave the rat race early by living below your means.  In my mind, this solved the issue of having to admit that I was wrong about something as fundamental as my career choice. It's a lot easier to say ""Oh, I had a few million and realized I had no one to impress"" (a lie) vs. ""Oh, I foolishly chose the wrong career and I was a risk-averse wimp who was too proud to admit it"" (the truth).

&#x200B;

This is not an easy thing to admit (thus the throwaway account) but I am an upper-middle class man who is saving every dime he can because he made a mistake in his career choice, and is seeking FIRE because it's easier than admitting that he fucked up.

Some expenses are harder to reduce than others. For me, it was eating out at work. Nearly every day I'd spend about $8.50 for a mediocre burrito, sandwich, or some other culinary money trap.

It took a while to get into a routine of making crock pot meals to remedy this, but when you do some quick math, it becomes real hard to justify my previous habit.

I'm able to get 4 meals out of a crock pot that also costs about a total of $8.50. Previously, 4 lunches would have cost me $34, so this saves me $25.50 each time.

This is amplified if we look at the time cost. Picking up the extra groceries only takes a few minutes a week, and the prepping+dumping of the food into the crock pot doesn't take much time either. It totals about 20 minutes.

So I'm saving $25.50 for 20 minutes of work. That's $76.50/hour, way more than I'm currently paid. 

BUT this is all after-tax savings. If we assume a 30% marginal tax rate, it's more like $109.29/hour.

So basically, every three crock pot meals I do is like making 110 bucks an hour. Not a bad gig.

I know I'm not the first person to think about expenses in these terms but if we can flip the thought process of reducing expenses in terms of pre-tax income, it makes it more fun. It flips the narrative from ""cutting back"" to ""earning more.""

Anyone make any similar expense cuts? I'd be interested to see what sort of value it translated to.",financialindependence

She's tethered to her oxygen tank 24/7 and barely able to leave her house, save for the short ride to the dialysis center three times a week for treatment of her type 2 diabetes. Her health is so poor that even if there was an available kidney for transplant, they wouldn't give it to her due to the low probability of her surviving & recovering from the operation. She is relatively young, but both her and her husband (who recently passed away from coronary disease) focused on their careers and didn't pay attention to their health. She's literally waiting for her body to stop functioning, and it's so sad to witness--especially when knowing that all the dreams she and her husband worked for will never be realized.

Please don't let this become you. I know some people can become overly obsessive about the accumulation of wealth above all else, but it's not worth it if you sacrifice your health in the process. As someone who has maintained my health into middle age, being healthy is more important to me than money. It's easy to neglect your health while on your FI journey, but in my opinion staying healthy and fit is much more difficult than getting rich. While you can automate many of your savings and investing habits, it takes active effort to eat right and exercise every day. As I get older, being fit has provided me with a much greater sense of accomplishment than achieving any financial milestone.

Young people tend to have more health, and old people tend to have more wealth, but life is so much sweeter when you have both. Plus, when you're staying active and making fitness a priority, you're less likely to feel bored with life once work stops consuming the majority of your time, as /u/jasonlong1212 and other active redditors can probably attest to.

Remember, it's much more difficult to regain your health once you've lost it than to maintain it as you go through life, so please don't neglect it. And if you're interested in FI and fitness, please join us in /r/FitFI!",financialindependence

* I'm down ~33%.  This puts me on the upper end of leanFIRE territory.  Another 33% and I'd have had to get a job anyway, just to avoid chewing my savings completely out of FIRE territory.

* Happily, I wasn't wrong about my value to my former company.  I asked to resume at my old salary, which was very high, and that was accepted without negotiation.

* I did negotiate away the things I hated about my job before, so I don't expect to hate it now.  I told my boss I was expecting to work maybe 3-5 years.

* I can work from home, which is ideal.  My industry is not directly affected by covid-19, although it does depend on consumption in general.  I expect job security for as long as I want to remain.

* I'm very risk tolerant when it comes to the market, so I'm hardly phased at the loss of value.  I'm not even certain it'll come back at all.

* I have very little confidence that anyone knows what the world will even look like in 20 years.  For this reason I see little point in stressing about it.  We'll roll with things as they evolve.  I've been poor before and I'm not afraid of it.

* I'll go back to maxing my 401K, HSA/etc, but I'm not going to save aggressively like before.  Instead I'm going to travel to some exotic places (assuming they ever fly a plane again), and buy myself some very nice toys.

413,Some tips to young people in this sub from a 26 y/o who has been on the journey for 5 years.,,2142,jupyqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jupyqj/some_tips_to_young_people_in_this_sub_from_a_26/,1605462566.0,"It seems like there are a decent amount of younger people on here (College/High School Age) more and more which is great! As a 26 y/o who has been on the path for 5 years now I wanted to provide some tips for younger people as they begin this journey. I don't have the experience of people who have FIRE'd per se, but I think I can help explain what worked for me. 

1. Learns the basics

Personal finance and investing is an awesome thing to get into because you can dig as deep into it as you want or stay at the surface level. There is a reason why some of the smartest investing minds in the world (Warren Buffett) read for hours on end. The finance world evolves, markets change, and the way people behave with money moves around. With that being said, you need to learn the basics. What are the basics?

“Spend less than you make, invest the difference”

Spend – Create a budget. Fixed expenses and then fun money. 

Make – Get a job that allows you to save a little bit of cash

Invest – Dollar Cost Average, 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage account, withdrawal rates. 

It will be easy to go down a rabbit hole when reading about personal finance to the point where it might even intimidate you. Learn the basics and get started. There are plenty of free online resources that will help you understand best practices like which % of your budget towards certain items and how to invest. You have some time to iron out the details. The worst thing you can do is not start. 

2. Keep it simple: Index Funds

Index funds. Index Funds. Index Funds. 

I don’t know how else to say this but I would recommend you start off with index funds. I know it isn’t what /r/stocks or /r/wallstreetbets is going to tell you but index funds will allow you to get a piece of the pie without the risk of individual stocks. The worst thing that could happen to you is you throw a grand in a stock based on a tip on Reddit and you get wiped out to the point where you don’t even want to invest in the market anymore. 

Hey competitiveduck, that is great but how do I avoid the FOMO of all these tech gains?

Understand that cycles happen. “Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered”. Look into the top 10 companies by market cap for each decade. Companies come and go. I am not anti-stock at all. I recommend that people play around with stocks to avoid FOMO but only once they have enough in index funds to where compound interest takes over. I didn’t buy a single share of stock until I had >100k invested in index funds and even now it is a small % of my larger portfolio.

3. Get the money

Get the money. You have to be selfish in your career at this point when your expenses are fairly low and you don’t have the responsibilities of a family. Change cities, change jobs, change companies. Get money. If you are all about starting a low-level job in a company with the idea that in 30 years you might be the CEO great, but there is only 1 CEO job for a reason. Maximize earnings in your 20s as much as you can, invest, and wait. If you don’t believe me, look up videos or pictures of what happens at 65 based on when you start investing. The difference in net worth is staggering. Get money. 

4. It easiest to compare yourself to others post-college

I’m not sure there will ever be a time in your life where it is easiest to feel bad about yourself than right after college. You go from everybody playing the same game in college to now everybody is in separate leagues and playing a different sport. You have a friend in law school in debt up to their ass, you have a friend crushing it at Google, you have a friend struggling to figure things out and there might be you just hoping to get enough money for guac at Chipotle. Understand that you don’t need to be anywhere else than where YOU think you need to be. Life tends to even itself out. 

“Comparison is the thief of joy”

5. Keep in touch with friends and take care of your body 

To echo on the last point, good friends are hard to come by the older you get. Try and keep in touch with them as much as possible and plan trips to see them. Some of my best friends still are my college friends. Use them as a base but don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and explore new people. 

In regard to staying in shape, there is no sense in retiring early if your body isn’t able to do things you want to do. Plain and simple. 

6. Do what works for you, not what works in a spreadsheet

You are going to hear about all the ways you can tinker with your investments or take on debt and theoretically it works in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets aren’t rooted in reality. Some of these include how it is easier to put less than 20% down on a house because interest rates are so low and invest the difference, or how you should invest 80% of your paycheck to tap into investing. Morgan Housel has a way of investing and I think it is great in that you should invest in a way that “helps you sleep at night” and in a way that you can do it consistently for decades. Do what works for you. 

7. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme

Understand the game that you are playing. Investing Twitter and TV networks react to daily moves in the market. You aren’t in it for the short term, you are in it for the long term. If you are in your early 20’s you probably have a 30-40-year time horizon. Think of all the crazy world events that have happened in the last 30-40 years alone. COVID, 08 Financial Crisis, Iraq War, 9/11, Dot Com Crash, and then the 1987 Market Crash. All of those “world is ending” type events have led to a 9.42% average return before inflation. To tap into the power of compound interest you need to stay in the market for a long period of time.

“Interrupting a favorable power law is the worst mistake you can make as an investor.” – Naval

8. Read the top posts on this subreddit but be aware of survivorship bias 

The fact that you are in this subreddit is a great start. Use the resources in the wiki to learn about investment options and what works for other people. Learn about people who have achieved FIRE and how they got there. Most of the time it is a bumpy road with kids, large one-off expenses, buying a house, changing careers, etc. Like the stock market, it is rarely a smooth ride. However, there is a lot of survivorship bias in here about people who have achieved FIRE. For every person who has achieved it, there are probably 10 who have given up, ruined a relationship, or became miserable due to extreme saving. Please understand that this is a grind and if you aren’t happy now with the hopes of being happy 30 years ago, I’d advise you to take a step back and read the below post. It is essential reading.

414,FI on my birthday!,,2142,gkpoom,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gkpoom/fi_on_my_birthday/,1589608885.0,"I did it today.  On my 47th birthday, I reached $3 million in cash & investments, a paid off house & 2 cars.  I have reached my FI target of $100k @ 3.3% SWR.   I knew it was going to be close with the markets, payday, and my company's equity coming in today.

Plan is to FIRE in 3 months.  $3 million was a symbolic number, I could have FIREd 2 months ago at $2.95 million and lived pretty much the same life.  However, I am getting another \~$70k in equity in 3 months and would like a bit of a buffer especially with the volatile markets.  Also, the plan was to take a nice trip to Europe in August - I don't see that happening.

It is crazy, I know of many people who are laid off, working reduced hours, worried about their job or tapping into debt.  And I am making plans to quit working.

&#x200B;

Mega edit:

**Asset allocation**

Cash & short term investments: 25% (increased 10% from equities due to C19)

Employer's Equity: 10%

Equity ETFs: 45% (down 10% - sold in early march, will buy back in later)  

Bond ETFs: 10%

Crypto: 10%

Please bring on the flames for timing the market, but I sold early-ish, it helps me sleep at night, and right now I am trying to be more conservative vs. aggressive.  

The crypto is a flyer.  I bought casino level bitcoin in 2012 at $18, then sold a bunch when it went up to $150.  Then bought a bunch more at $1000, and have been selling little bits for a few years.  Total investment: $45k, total value sold and still held: $500k.  I would like to sell more, but it has a capital gains tax liability, so FIRE with no income next year would help reduce taxes.

415,"Living with your parents can save you an incredible amount of money, but it's not without its costs",,2145,c2wjc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c2wjc2/living_with_your_parents_can_save_you_an/,1561040112.0,"This week was my 1 year anniversary at my job since graduating college. I also just hit 50k net worth, which is staggering for me to even think about. I work in Software Engineering making 71k a year. It’s not my dream job, and I don’t think I’ll be here forever, but I’m happy enough right now, and I can’t complain about the salary. I’ve also had a side gig for almost 8 years now (just turned 23) playing piano at weddings and events and such. It's usually less than 5 hours of work a week and nets me somewhere between 6-10k a year depending on how many events I do.

# Background

Thanks to some massive scholarships as well as the money saved from my piano job and some other internships, plus just a little help from my amazing parents, I was able to graduate with an engineering degree completely debt free, with just enough left over to buy a totaled and repaired car on the cheap (a risk, to be sure). So a year ago, I entered the work force pretty much without a dollar for or against my name.

I also live with my parents. I'm not a super social person, and I wanted to spend some more time with my little sister before she goes off to college, so I decided to move back in with my parents. I'm very fortunate. They don't charge me rent, and we aren't very strict about accounting for food payments. I do try to pay for meals and groceries often enough that food evens out, and I do lots of chores and help out around the house to ""atone"" for my presence there, but honestly, I think my parents are just glad to have me around. I'm very fortunate in this regard.

So, in the last year, I had a before tax income of \~80k, which taxes brought down to \~63k, I had zero debt or rent, and was able to save the vast majority of it, 50k, which is an after tax SR of 79% in my first year in the working world! Where did the other 13k go? In addition to the gas and car expenses, and the food that I try my best to pay for, it's hard not to be materialistic, especially when living with materialistic parents… I bought tons of books (I love reading), and splurged on a $3000 harp (I've wanted to learn the harp for years), and I have a pretty substantial collection of alcohol for making cocktails. And I do go out with my friends occasionally. Additionally, my parents love to go on vacation, and, living with them, it can be hard to not tag along. Overall, it's all stuff that brings me joy, so I think it's worth it to spend on, especially while I'm in a position where I can.

# The power of 50k at age 23

50k is an absolutely ridiculous amount of money to have saved this early in my career. At 6% returns, over 42 years for a traditional retirement at age 65, that comes out to $578k. After 1 year, I am shockingly close to already achieving a comfortable retirement. If I could do one more year of this, I'd be there. Since I am only 23, it's amazing to see how powerful this head start is, and how many options it affords me for my future.

# The cost of staying with my parents

Given the massive amount of money I've managed to save, it's interesting to consider the ""costs"" of living with my parents for free. I do have a much longer commute than I would like, about an hour each way, which has the tangible cost of gas and wear on my car, and the intangible, but somehow more substantial cost on my sanity. There is the lack of freedom and independence, and at times, the lack of really feeling like a true adult. And there is the cost on my social life, which is mostly nonexistent due to

1. Living far away from any source of young people
2. Living with my parents…
3. Lack of motivation for a non-socially oriented person like myself to find friends, given barriers 1 and 2.

# The cost of moving

Since I value my sanity, freedom, independence, adultness, and hypothetical future friends, I have found myself thinking more and more lately about moving out and taking the next step. I eventually want to be a homeowner, but am not there yet, maybe in 5-10 years. So renting it is. Here is my hypothetical ""cost of moving out"" breakdown:

* Apartment + Utilities: $1,500 - $1800/mo (This seems to be about average for a 1 bedroom apartment in my area) 
* Groceries + Food: $250/mo (This is about what I averaged in college, buying food from the grocery store and cooking it myself, a practice I look forward to continuing)
* Increased social activity: $150/mo (I'm just throwing this here as a baseline. If I know myself, I won't end up spending nearly this much, but it's interesting to think about how moving would probably cause an increase in spending in other areas.)
* Internet: $50/mo (I hate TV, so I wouldn't be buying cable)
* One-time moving expenses:
   * Furniture: $2000 (I have no idea what this number should be. I'd need to buy couches and tables and shelves. I've already got a bed and kitchen supplies from my college apartment days)
   * Decent electric keyboard: $2000-$5000 (I don't want to be the guy with the super loud acoustic piano in an apartment)

So I'm looking at $1900-2200/month or \~23-26k/year, plus 4-7K in one-time expenses. I'll just call it 25k and 5k.

That's pretty hefty, that's enough to slash my savings rate in half. Furthermore, that is worth potentially much more, given the assumption that I would invest those savings were I to not move out. 30k over 41 years (age 24-65) at 6% returns amounts to a whopping 327k for a traditional retirement. However, if I were to FIRE at the respectable young age of 35 (which I probably won't do), it is a much less whopping 60k, only a 2x increase. Since my savings for the next year would be reduced to 20k, the 60k effective cost for moving out for just one year would be roughly 3 FIRE years.

Over time, my SR would be able to increase with my salary, and the ""effective cost"" of each successive year's lack of savings would decrease as the FIRE year draws nearer, but it's amazing to see the power of early saving played out in a few hypothetical numbers.

# Conclusion

So it's an interesting decision. Living with my parents has likely saved me untold financial stress, and will allow me to FIRE years early, but is not without its own costs. But on the other hand, perhaps ridding myself of the ""costs"" of my parental living right now is worth the incredible cost. Purchasing freedom and independence is, after all, what FIRE is all about.

Hello everyone, I've been following this subreddit for almost 2 years and recently hit a milestone I wouldn't have reached this early if it wasn't for all of you. I wanted to give my thanks, as well as show you how I ended up where I am for anyone interested in reading.

2016 ($14k NW end of year) 

[June]  - Just graduated from highschool and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. With college application deadlines coming to an end very soon, and having my teachers, guidance counselors, and parents rush me to make up my mind, I randomly decided to take an accounting major in college because I heard it was in demand. 

[September] - Began my first year of college as well as maintaining 30+ hours at the grocery store I was working at throughout highschool. 

2017 ($31k NW end of year) 

[February] - First semester of college was coming to an end and I was completely miserable. The work was not difficult, the load was not too much for me, but deep in my stomach it just felt so wrong. I knew it wasn't for me and I began showing symptoms of depression because of it that even my close friends began to notice 

[April] - After 2 more months of feeling unmotivated and depressed I decided to pull the plug and drop out. I had no plan B, it was a spur of the moment decision and it felt like the 1000lbs I was carrying on my shoulders was finally gone. 

[June] - Spent the last 2 months working at the grocery store full time and my parents were fed up. We we're arguing every day because of my decision to drop out and after a heated argument they kicked me out the house at 19 years old. 

[July] - Spent 2 weeks with a friend while looking for a place. Ended up finding a basement apartment for cheap and moved in. I knew the minimum wage grocery store job wasn't going to cut it so I found an ad for a construction labourer position paying slightly higher ($35k/yr) and got hired. I spent the rest of the year slaving away and saving every penny I could. I was living VERY cheaply 

2018 ($46k NW end of year) 

(June) - After almost a year of working my ass off, starting earlier then everyone, staying later then everyone, coming in on the weekends to sweep and clean up, the company owner began to be very fond of me and gave me the position of Lead Labourer. This new position almost doubled my income, putting me at $60k/yr. Although the massive pay increase tempted me to splurge, I continued living as if I was still making $35k, and dumped all the extra money into my investment accounts. 

2019 ($72k NW end of year) 

(January - December) - This year not much changed. I was working the same job and still living in the same basement apartment alone. I continued living extremely frugally and was focusing on adding as much money to my investment accounts as possible, even if that meant sacrificing things I really wanted. 

2020 (101K NW end of year) 

(March) - Bought a car for $11k as a birthday gift to myself as I was tired of taking the bus. 

(April) - COVID hit, but thankfully I was able to continue working, most weeks actually working more hours then usual. 

(September) Been working consistently the whole year with no breaks or shutting down due to the virus. The same company owner that gave me a promotion in 2018 asked me if I'd like to train to become a crane operator and I gladly accepted. My wage will remain the same, but once I'm fully certified in about 3 - 4 years I can expect $120k/yr. 

(December) - Just deposited the cheque that puts me at $101k NW! Thank you all for the motivation!",financialindependence

419,From negative $50k to quarter-millionaires in less than 5 years,,2097,b840b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b840b5/from_negative_50k_to_quartermillionaires_in_less/,1554133196.0,"So I just did my quarterly net worth update and just noticed that we crossed the quarter million mark! And since people seem to like these kinds of posts, as well as being a good little reflection for myself, I thought I would share a little progress report of our journey.

Here is a year-by-year summary:

**2014**

* Got married to my wife in my senior year.
* Graduated, and got first job at start of May. Starting salary $52k in a HCOL area (Boston).
* Had about $35,000+ in student loan debt.
* Wife graduated a year prior working for a year already making ~$41k.
* She had ~$10,000 in student loan debt (low interest, to her parents)  at this point. 
* Including her car loan, we were $50k+ in debt (basically our net worth) at the time I graduated.
* I always hated the idea of debt, so we prioritized paying it down as aggressively as we could afford.
* We kept the same jobs until we would move in a couple years, earning basic 3-5% raises every year.

**2015**

* End of the year, we made a lump sum payment of $9k to pay off my student loans (while dipping into our E-fund) just so we could say we did so before the end of 2015.
* We were still making minimum payments on my wife's student loans and car loans since the interest was very negligible.
* This was around the time I started to get more interested in investing and learned about MMM, Reddit in general, then this sub, other FIRE bloggers, etc.

**2016**

* My wife started to get a little home sick so we decided to move to a LCOL area (Midwest) where her parents lived, and away from where I grew up. I was okay with it mainly because in my mind, LCOL meant easier to save.
* We decided to temporarily live at her parents house while we found our own place. We paid them the market rate in rent, which was maybe a third of our previous rent. Since they weren't doing so great financially and healthwise, the rent money and helping out around the house worked out well for them so we didn’t feel rushed to find our own place.
* We did end up taking small paycuts. My wife found a job with salary of $45k. I found one shortly after with a salary of $51k. Since then, we’ve earned 5-7% yearly raises.

**2017**

* By this time, I got my wife on the FIREwagon. I think we averaged around a 70% SR for the duration we lived with the in-laws.
* Predictably, we (mainly my wife), got sick of living with the in-laws. So we started saving up for a house down payment.
* Lost maybe about $7k in the crypto craze. Still holding though.

**2018** 

* We bought a house for ~$150k putting 15% down, no PMI, at 4.1% rate.
* Even though we were spending more for house things, we still tried to keep our savings up.
* Averaged around 60% SR for the year.
* At the end of the year, we found out my wife is pregnant.

**2019**

* My wife finds a new job, earning her a good pay bump. She now makes $60k, basically what I make now.
* Crossed the $260k net worth mark at the end of March! ~$213k in investments. Not too shabby for a couple of 28 year olds.

[Here's](https://imgur.com/tfA4oKt) a little YNAB snapshot of the last 3+ years of networth tracking. Our expenses during that period averaged to around $3,100/month. That's enough to get us yearly visits back to Boston, grass-fed beef, a Nintendo Switch, among many other luxuries. 

With the baby on the way and since we crossed a significant milestone, we may relax our savings a little. But we’ll see!

420,[Milestone] My path to $750K NW as a 27F non-engineer,,2081,k8rmgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8rmgt/milestone_my_path_to_750k_nw_as_a_27f_nonengineer/,1607381516.0,"Hi all - I was very hesitant about making this post because (a) it felt braggy, and (b) I’m wary of having too much personal info, even if anonymous, out there on the internet.

But what pushed me do it was seeing yet another casually sexist comment on /r/personalfinance about girlfriends taking your money. I’m tired of generalizations (especially in places where the demographics skew male, like finance subreddits) about women being obstacles to a man’s FI journey at best, or high-maintenance gold-diggers at worst. So I feel obligated to be a visible example of a FI-minded woman, and to add another female voice to the FI conversation.

**TL,DR:**

* Super fortunate in many ways. Graduated debt-free from a top school
* Investment banking → tech (but non-engineer)
* \>60% savings rate in a VVHCOL city - live comfortably but intentional about spending
* 5 years after graduation: $750K net worth (\~$300K in post-tax Roth retirement accounts), and total annual comp of \~$275K (excl equity)
* Net worth growth came both from increasing income (switching companies, getting promoted) and from healthy investment returns throughout

* **I was super lucky, in a lot of ways**. I had a middle-class upbringing but my immigrant parents both worked full-time and taught me the value of education and of saving money early on. We always spent below our means.
* **My upbringing and debt-free education = single biggest driver of my financial success thus far.** My parents also paid for my college education so I graduated debt-free from a top university (one of Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford). I amassed a small starting stash of \~$20K by graduation from working paid internships during every college summer (and investing my savings).
* **I started my career in investment banking, then transitioned into corporate strategy at tech companies**. Initially I took a pay cut in leaving finance, but have since grown my income comfortably - and it was worth it solely for the higher quality of life (i.e. not working 80 hours/week in a soul-crushing grind, surrounded by very rich yet deeply unhappy people, adding little discernible value to society).
* **I currently live very comfortably in a VHCOL city**. I eat well, take plenty of vacations, rent a nice apartment, buy myself small luxuries, etc. - but am intentional about spending my money where I feel it most improves my wellbeing.
* **My savings rate is currently >60%**, which includes maxing out retirement contributions. I acknowledge this is also only possible because I’m young and don’t have any dependents yet (my boyfriend is a software engineer and does fine, though I’m proud my income/NW are higher than his) - if I have kids in this city in the near future, my expenses will definitely skyrocket.

***On investing***

* Investing has been a major driver of my net worth growth: **\~$275K of the $750K NW is from investment gains made over the last 5 years.**
* I’ve invested all of my extra money (excluding 6 months emergency savings / small amount in checking) since I was in high school.
* Passive investing is objectively the best approach for the vast majority of people. About ⅔ of my net worth is passively invested in diversified low-fee index funds / ETFs.
* However, I enjoy active investing and doing the research, so **about ⅓ of my NW is invested in individual stocks**. My actively invested portfolio has made substantial returns over the last 5 years thanks to several investments that have doubled, tripled, up to 9x’d - like NVDA, NVCR, SQ, TWLO, CRM, etc. Given that I’m young and have a very long investing horizon, I’m okay with having a somewhat higher level of risk in my portfolio from these individual stocks.
* **I also basically never sell my investments** \- have never tried to time the market, never sold because I thought it was about to crash, etc. It’s worked out pretty well for me, with my 5Y annualized return beating all market indices in the same time period - time will tell if that’ll continue to be true.

***Reflecting / looking ahead***

* My target milestone is to hit **$1M net worth by 30**, which looks quite feasible at my current income and assuming my portfolio/the market doesn’t tank in the next 2 years.
* Getting to the first $100K really is the hardest - it just keeps snowballing from there, and your NW increases faster and faster... I only made a post about hitting $500K \~4 months ago! 
* **I don’t count illiquid equity in any of my projections**. Even though it might turn into a big payday if my current company goes public, for now, I treat it as imaginary money. (If it does become liquid, then my path to FI will accelerate substantially, given I have high six figures in nominal equity value, both vested/unvested.)
* **$2.5M is my fat-FI number**, but I’ll probably keep working after I hit that. But who knows - if I get married / start a family / have kids, maybe my priorities will change.
* Leaving finance for tech was a big leap for me, in part because staying in finance was the path of least resistance / most prestige / highest comp. I could have left my top-tier investment banking job for a role in private equity / hedge funds / venture capital instead, and been making $300K+ comp as a 24-year-old (as many of my banking peers did). Taking a pay cut to go to a startup felt risky and uncomfortable at the time -- but I have no regrets, looking back. Leaving finance made me happier, healthier, and a better and more interesting person; even if it also meant a slightly longer path to hit NW milestones, I’m still doing just fine. The tradeoffs were more than worth it.

421,It only took me 410 days to go from $500k to $600k in my 401k,,2085,i3uvz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i3uvz3/it_only_took_me_410_days_to_go_from_500k_to_600k/,1596585835.0,"It was June 21, 2019, the first day of summer, when I first broke the $500k resistance, and I was on track to  $600k within a 1-year timeframe before the pandemic hit. Regardless, I checked my balance after close today, and was grinning from ear to ear. 

Oh, I know it will likely dip below that a bunch of times before it firmly settles above this threshold, but I’m patient and diligent with always contributing the maximum to my 401k each year, and my company has a generous 4 1/2% match + a 3% enhanced contribution when they sunsetted the defined benefit plan 10-years ago.  

Now my goal is to see if I can hit $700k in less than 400-days.  VEIRX, VIEIX, VSMAX, VINIX, VWUAX are the funds in my 401k.

I just want to encourage everyone who strives for financial independence to stay the course, be patient, sacrifice wants vs. needs when you can, and contribute as much as possible towards your retirement funds.

AMA.,,2077,68a6dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/68a6dg/im_that_multimillionaire_app_developer_who/,1493482912.0,"Hi, I'm Allen Wong. I was told to create an AMA here after [my comment about what it's like being rich](https://reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/67zv7a/my_dad_does_tile_for_a_living_this_is_one_of_the/dgv60tg) shot to the top of the BestOf subreddit.

**My upbringing**: My parents were raised in the slums. My mother worked in a sweatshop in NYC. And my father passed away unnaturally three months after I graduated from college.

**How I got started**: After my father's passing, my mother suffered from a five-year-long psychotic episode. So I moved back to NYC from LA to take care of her. Since I was the only one in the family with a job due to the recession, I self-taught myself how to create apps during weekends and weeknights in hopes of making some side income. What I didn't expect was that this hobby ended up making much more than my full time job.

**How the business is going**: A few of my apps have topped the charts. Most recently, my Remote S for Tesla app became the #1 Lifestyle app and about 10-20% of Tesla owners have it. My most successful app, ""5-0 Radio Police Scanner"", is currently the #1 News app and has been and still is one of top downloaded apps since its creation in 2009. My second most successful app, Police Scanner+, was an app I created just to compete against myself so that I could hog up all the top search results for the keywords ""Police Scanner"" in the App Store.

**What I do these days**: Mostly traveling the world, dating, having fun with friends, and finding ways to help out the community. I have [funded other people's kids' college funds](http://regoapps.com/collegefund), [given people rides in my Lamborghini for charity](https://youtu.be/fpIr2dWqdSo), tipped people much more than what I was paying for, [custom built an Iron Man suit](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLUJkI0Do_m/?taken-by=regoapps) to [cheer up kids at hospitals](https://www.instagram.com/p/4quD_zSfhf/?taken-by=regoapps), [helped get clean water to villages that before didn't have access to it](https://my.charitywater.org/p/myprojects?member_id=185595), and etc.

**Advice on app development**: Since I often get asked for advice, I gave speeches at different universities about how to get started on apps or how to make apps successful:

I worked with countless hiring managers to help fill a number of clerical, technical, blue-collar and white-collar professional jobs in Finance, Accounting and STEM areas.

On a somewhat regular basis, we had male job applicants who were out of the job market for 1-5 years.  I called them for a phone screen and they told me they left the corporate world to travel the world and retire early.  But for a number of reasons they decided to get back into the corporate rat race after a long time out of the workforce.

I wanted to give them the matter of the doubt and found many of their stories and background to be very interesting.  But almost without exception, the hiring managers did not want to touch any applicant who had not been in the workforce for over a year.  They were seen as stale, lazy, eccentric and unusual. I kept pushing for the hiring manager to be more flexible but usually got nowhere.  The only time these workers had any luck is in a career field with a shortage of qualified workers.

But I feel like there's a large percentage of newcomers around here (not to mention a decent percentage of veterans trying to recapture that feeling of being a newcomer) who need to hear it.

**FIRE** 

**IS** 

**BORING**

Now, if you’re new to all this, it might be news to you. After all, it doesn’t feel boring in that first phase. Your mind has recently been blown with possibilities for your life you never before considered possible; Everywhere around you, you see opportunities to optimize your spending, your portfolio, your spreadsheets; There are so many books/blogs/podcasts you need to consume to become even more informed on it and optimize your plan even more... 

You want that initial rush of excitement over all the possibilities to last and sustain you and motivate you throughout this entire journey.

But the truth is, this phase doesn’t last. Within a year or two you’ll have consumed just about every shred of relevant information you can. Your plan has been written and rewritten a dozen times. You’ve had several dozen fights with your partner about whether or not it’s actually worth cutting another 2% out of your grocery budget and why the hell you have to keep the thermostat on 65 when it’s only saving $15/mo on your electric bill. Your spreadsheets have been stress tested and refined to levels of confidence several significant digits more than you’re actually capable of achieving… you get the picture.

And now?

You just keep going. You track your budget. You check in on your NW every few months. You rebalance your portfolio maybe once a year. It takes a grand total of *maybe* 10 hrs of effort in any given year. People call it the boring middle, but it’s really more like the boring remaining 99%. 

99% of this is just sticking to the plan for decade, after decade, after decade. Not for a year, or two, or ten. But literally however many years you have left in your life. Because the work doesn’t stop when you reach FI or retire. After that, unless you’ve just massively overestimated how much you need, you’ve still got to keep living on the budget you’ve set for yourself. And it's the same boring slog to just stay on track after retirement as it was before. 

People don’t fail at this because they’re missing some super secret knowledge that only the elite have access to. They don’t retire early because it’s just long, boring fucking work to commit to not spending money they otherwise could be for decades on end. 

So when you look at the front page of this sub and think “ugh, there’s just never any new content around here”. It’s because there **isn’t** any new content for people to post. 99.9% of what you need to know for this has been reiterated to death already on MMM, and ERE, and ERN, and Mad Fientist, and YMOYL, and r/FinancialIndependence, and god only knows how many other places before. And the actually new, interesting, relevant stuff takes a lot of time to put together and doesn’t come around on a daily basis to satisfy your habitual Reddit browsing.

And that’s how it should be. You’re not pursuing FI for its entertainment value. You’re doing it because (presumably) you want to actually do something else with the security, freedom, and time it affords you. And if you are doing it for the entertainment, you're actually making it less likely you'll succeed here. Because the second the novelty starts to wear off, you're going to start looking somewhere else for it, and then it's all ""ooh look, Tesla announced a new model"". 

You want exciting? Go look at loss porn on WSB. 

You want to actually build a predictable and reliable plan for retirement that you can execute on over the course of decades? It’s going to be boring.",financialindependence

430,Nearing FIRE w/ $2.6M NW at age 33 – My journey & thoughts,,2008,j1ny7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j1ny7k/nearing_fire_w_26m_nw_at_age_33_my_journey/,1601337211.0,"**TLDR:** Here’s goes my first ever post on Reddit: Just hit $2.6M net worth at age 33 after discovering I was working towards FIRE without knowing what it was until stumbling across it online last year. Wife doesn’t care, but wanted to tell someone. My story, lessons learned, & how FIRE changed my strategy.

**Reasons for FIRE:** I’ve worked from home for a tech company for 13 years (Support Delivery)  Unlike many people on this sub, I actually love my job, and would do it forever, but know I got incredible lucky and don’t know how I’ve lasted this long already with the BS corporate performance cycle, quotas, etc.  My skillset is not transferrable, so if/when they fire me, I’d likely be starting at the ground-level at another company making little $, and probably not working from home, so I decided that when that days comes, I want to be ready.   In a way I see it as being a ""good steward"" so to speak of the hand and luck that I was dealt, and I want to make sure I'm not squandering that by pissing it away on things that don't matter.   Curious if anyone else is in the same boat with why they're pursuing FIRE?

I’m a bit of a lone wolf with how I live life, so when I stumbled across the FIRE movement online last year, I was excited to find the formal framework for what I had been pursuing on my own for years. I had never heard of the 4% rule, and didn’t even think about stocks as a viable option for early retirement, so my focus had been on buy-&-hold rentals, which after managing 7 myself, although almost no work when counted in hours, started becoming more *stressful* than I liked.

This sub, along with the blogs like MMM, changed my approach and for the past year, I’ve been slowly changing my focus on simplifying my investments, stopped buying homes and started dumping excess income into VTI instead, and even sold my first rental this year.

**Income:** Started at $48k in 2007, now $160k + $70k profit from 7 rentals mostly owned with cash.

**Spending:** My current savings rate is 87%. I spend only $26k / year somehow but feel I live luxuriously. I own 2 cars, dirt bikes, ATVs (all Hondas), and spend plenty of time each year vacationing overseas. My #1 expense is travel, and some trips I figure out a way to get the owner of our side-gig (performing arts) to pay for as long as we perform or teach while there (while also making the trip partially tax deductible too). [Link to my current spending / income / savings rate chart](https://i.imgur.com/BKAGvgF.jpg)

**Investments:** [Link to my mint.com entire NW summary](https://i.imgur.com/xvTLC6P.jpg)

* **$1.35M** – paid off real estate (now 7 total homes, $1.6M minus $367k in mortgages), includes my personal $300k house. Average ROI for my rentals is 14% w/ just rents, 39% if capital appreciation is factored in. It’s lower because most of them are paid off, so less leverage. [(Screenshot of Rental ROI Details)](https://i.imgur.com/waVzvqy.jpg)  I used my HELOC to pay ""cash"" for homes, then aggressively paid it down and repeated.  Was probably risky, but it's paid off now, and is my ""E-fund"" now.
* **$500k** – Taxable (VTI / VXUS) – M1Finance [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/bYFuyXi.jpg) Their automation is awesome btw
* **$220k** – Taxable in my company’s stock, acquired through ESPP. Yes I want to move this to VTI, but $130k is gains, so don’t know how to without a huge tax bill.  Any ideas?
* **$345k** – 401k maxed out [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/3vMwfQk.jpg) (Russel 3000, the best options I could find)
* **$96k** – Other (HSA maxed out, joint SoFi account w/ wife, Prosper.com, 24k cash, etc)

**Taxes:** Federal taxes paid is $16k / year. Real estate helps a lot here, plus our side gig which turns many expenses, hobbies, & travel I'd pay anyway into deductions.

**Marriage:** I’m married, but we keep our finances separate, so all these numbers are my own. We both contribute an equal amount into a small joint checking for things like groceries & utilities. I’ve shared with her my net worth when I crossed $2.0M, but she didn’t seem to care much.

**Family Life:** No help from family, at all... I actually ran away from home as a minor and never went back.  I took the GED and started college at age 15, graduated at 19.  I think pushing the ""youngest to graduate blah blah"" narrative hard with the college recruiters definitely helped me land the tech job, not because I was particularly skilled.  I've been working full time since age 16.

**Current Plan:**

* Ride this job out as long as I can without getting fired in spite waning motivation and struggling with work performance.  Enjoy the freedom of working from ""home"", wherever home is that day.
* Continue simplifying finances. Sell 220k of company stock somehow. Want to also sell a few more homes eventually and put that $ in the stock market. I wouldn’t mind keeping a few long term if I don’t have another job to give me something to do.  Dreading the capital gains bill from all this.

**Thoughts & Reflections:**

* My philosophy in life (FIRE, taxes, politics, money) has been ""tell me what the rules of the game are, and I'll figure out how to win"".  I see so many people whining how they can never succeed in the current ""system"" (thankfully not so much on this sub), when in reality, no one is going to come along and change the rules for you personally so you can succeed.  It's your job to win given the current system the best we can.
* I bought my houses in 2013–2018, when prices were still near the bottom after the recession. I realize this was just luck, and don’t intend to keep pushing that luck or think that is a repeatable format. No regrets, I just got very lucky.
* Keep maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, something I didn't start doing until discovering FIRE.
* I had dumped a bunch of money in cryptos over the last couple years. Finally pulled the plug and got out with big losses. They're right, the pain of seeing losses is way worse than gains. Oh well.
* This year I finally sold all my hard gold and silver that I've owned since 1999.  Yes, it was in preparation for Y2K.  Also yes, I was just a 13 year old child (but a very prepared child!)
* Focus on choosing a career path that maximizes income first in any way possible. That's far more important than cutting $20 off your cell phone bill.  This should be the 1st step to FIRE.
* IMO, doing “something you love” isn’t as glamorous as it sounds. I went to college for art, and realized that although it seemed “fun”, it doesn't pay, and there’s no quicker way to kill a fun hobby than having to do it for a living. Also, I’d rather work a fraction my life at a desk job than my whole life doing something I thought sounded cool at age 20. If the 8-5 desk job doesn’t sound fun, focus on what makes decent money that you COULD still find enjoyable. There’s more options you could enjoy than you realize. Instead of just focusing on “what sounds fun to ME”, focus on “what does the world need more of”, or “what's in high demand in my community that I’d enjoy somewhat at least”. The money often follows that.
* In the beginning I was focused on maximizing returns, which is why I chose rentals. Average work is only a 1-2 hours / week, BUT, I’ve realized I hate the stress. E.g. recent text from tenant: “Sent my brother to check on house, he got stabbed by squatters, is in hospital”. …talk about a way to ruin a weekend (well, more like 4 months, squatters are no joke). Now that I have higher net worth & more money “working for me”, I don’t mind sacrificing return % for peace of mind.
* Don’t turn down living your best life today. There are tons of opportunities, trips, etc that seemed like they cost a lot of money at the time, but turned out to some of my best memories that I would never give up, even if I missed out on compounding gains as a result. Say yes to the parts of life that come along that excite you, and don’t put if off until retirement, since these are what make life worth living, not your net worth $.  I often think “if I died today, would I have regrets having focused on savings so much”? Find that balance & slash the stuff that doesn’t matter.  For us, that’s kids, big house, alcohol, nice hotels, wedding, any status symbols, etc).

As you can see, I'm an open book, so I'm open to any thoughts, questions, or advice on anything I may be overlooking or doing wrong.",financialindependence
431,House Passes Bill Making Big Changes to U.S. Retirement System,,1979,bs60xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bs60xs/house_passes_bill_making_big_changes_to_us/,1558633831.0,"Summary of changes:

&#x200B;

\-   repeal the age cap for contributing to individual retirement accounts, currently 70½.

\-  increase the age to start taking required withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs to 72 from 70½.

\-  encourage 401(k)-style plans to offer annuities by giving certain employers some protection from future liability if their chosen insurer fails to pay claims.

\-  allow parents to withdraw up to $10,000 from 529 education-savings plans for repayments of some student loans .

\-   parents could take penalty-free distributions from retirement accounts of up to $5,000 within a year of the birth or adoption of a child to cover associated expenses.

\-   allow employers without an affiliation to band together to offer a 401(k)-type plan—an effort to encourage companies without retirement plans to offer them.

\-  repeal a 2017 change to the so-called Kiddie Tax that often boosts tax rates on “unearned” income received by children in low- and middle-income families and was causing surprise tax increases for many.

\-  To help pay for the changes, the House legislation would require many people who inherit tax-advantaged retirement accounts to withdraw the money within a decade and pay any taxes due. The Senate version, the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, or RESA, would require beneficiaries to liquidate balances above $400,000 at the date of death within five years.

433,High-Income Millennials Put Retirement Savings Ahead of Student Loans: Survey,,1982,ddugc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddugc5/highincome_millennials_put_retirement_savings/,1570314841.0,"> A new Spectrem Group report on millennials focuses on income levels rather than net worth in an effort to discover how this generation of high earners is using its significant income to create a portfolio of investment and savings vehicles.

>Spectrem noted that the oldest millennials are approaching 40, and the way in which they invest their money has implications for the future of the advisory industry.

>“As America’s largest generation, millennials have fully arrived as investors,’’ Spectrem’s president George Walper Jr. said in a statement. “They matter now to all financial advisors and providers who are paying attention to generational changes among investors.”

>The research was restricted to millennials with minimum annual incomes of $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for couples. It was conducted between May and August, and involved 443 participants.
Two-thirds of high-income millennials in the study had education-related debt, but only about half reported a personal financial effect from their student loans.

>This is in contrast to the situation millions of Americans burdened with student loan debt find themselves in.

>The Spectrem research found that high-income millennials placed a higher priority on saving for retirement than paying off student loans.

>At the same time, more than half agreed or strongly agreed that their education-related debt prevented them from contributing as much as they would like to their 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement program.

>The study shed light on how high-income millennials are saving or spending their money, and how they are allocating their investable assets.

>Among the findings, 53% of millennials defined success as the ability to afford leisure activities, while 45% said it was raising a family.

>About half purported to be more concerned about their aging parents’ health than about their own, which could influence their investing decisions, Spectrem noted.

>Three in four millennials in the study said they planned to retire between the ages of 50 and 70. Spectrem said this indicated that few put themselves in the “I will never be able to retire” or “I don’t plan to ever retire” categories.

>Slightly less than half of high-income millennials reported that they had a financial advisor, and a comparatively higher percentage of younger ones said they had found their advisor through advertisements rather than from referrals.

434,I left a FAANG pre-FI for a more fulfilling job and took more than a 50% pay cut. It was not everything I expected it to be.,,1967,jhe6va,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/,1603564946.0,"But it was some of the things I expected it to be.

This is my first post here, though I’ve been commenting on this sub for a while now, and I lurked long before that. I want to share my story because I think it will resonate with many people here, and maybe it will help some people. It probably will most closely resonate with people of a similar background: tech workers who are feeling jaded after working at a large tech company for a few years. However, I think it could be relatable for anyone considering leaving a comfortable but unfulfilling job, in search for something more meaningful. This post is not going to cover many specifics about financials or financial advice, but a FI mindset strongly influenced my decision-making. It’s a common topic of this sub to experience a longing for more fulfilling work, especially once you have FU money or are approaching coastFI, and having made the leap about 9 months ago I think I have some insight about how things can turn out if you choose to take a leap of faith.

I also fully acknowledge that many on this sub don’t experience a need for more fulfilling work; several of you find other means of fulfillment and just want to FIRE ASAP, period, and that is totally fine, but this post may be less relevant to you.

#Background

I joined a FAANG as a software dev after graduating college. I was fortunate to graduate with less than 10k in debt, and I paid it off quickly. I performed well and was promoted after about two years. As my NW increased, it felt like blinders were slowly being removed from my eyes. Like many people on here, I had a lot of anxiety about financial security growing up - so much so that getting a high paying job was virtually all I thought about since I was in high school. As my NW hit 100k, I started to feel somewhat secure about money and my employability; I took a step back and started to realize that I was never going to feel fulfilled by the work I was doing (which involved working on an interesting but not very impactful smartphone feature). Without as much financial anxiety, I was able to give myself space to reflect and understand what my real goals were - something I had neglected for a long time.

I tried to make it work on my old team. I thought that if I found the right kind of role or peer group, I could tolerate not feeling like my work was that important. But I knew deep down that wouldn’t be the case.

I also looked for opportunities on other teams. I think this could have worked out. I found one opening that seemed like it would be a work style I liked better (TSE rather than SWE), and in an area that felt more impactful (healthcare).

But I ended up finding an opportunity elsewhere that was more risky but seemed potentially more rewarding for me.

#Reflections and the next opportunity

In my reflections, I realized I really regretted not taking more humanities and social science classes in college. I barrelled through the CS curriculum with tunnel vision, intent only on getting a job at a FAANG or similar. I had always wanted to study psychology, but, coming from a family of engineers, voices in my head always told me that wasn’t a “real” field.

Additionally, I started to feel a growing need to do work that was impactful and helped people. I think anyone might feel this longing, but I think those from marginalized communities such as myself might be especially likely to feel this need to give back. As my confidence in my abilities and skills grew, it started to feel ridiculous that I wasn’t using them for social good.

I began searching for career paths that would scratch my itch to learn about more social science fields, and that would be impactful in ways I found fulfilling. I still wanted to work in something at least partially technical, since I wanted to make use of my skill set. I eventually found a not-for-profit research center nearby that focused on applying computational methods to complex social problems, varying from sex trafficking to religious extremism. I reached out to the organization, and ended up meeting some staff to discuss the field and what I might do to get involved. I was hoping for some PhD program recommendations, which they gave (for anyone wondering, they recommended I apply to CS or Engineering programs, and specialize in something like computational social science). But it also turned out that they had a grant that was getting dispersed in the next month, and someone with my background would be appropriate for one of the roles in that project.

At that time, I had about 110k in retirement accounts, 70k in taxable accounts, and around 10-15k cash. I was 24 years old. Arguably, I was lean-coastFI, meaning if I didnt save anything more, I could probably be leanFI by retirement age just on the savings that compounded. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but at my old job I was probably making close to 200k/yr including RSUs and bonus. I got an offer for the other job, and the pay was 88k - not a terrible salary but definitely a huge cut - still, I was expecting 65-70k, so I was a bit surprised. Healthcare benefits were similar. Retirement options and general perks were better at the FAANG but not terrible at the other org.

I thought about it a lot. I met the staff at the org multiple times to feel it out as best I could. I tried to keep myself in check, but I’ll admit that I was very hopeful and idealistic that taking this opportunity was going to give my work so much more meaning, and that the pay cut was going to be totally worth it.

#9 months later: the grass is not as green as I thought it would be, but it is still greener

There are days when my work is everything I thought it would be; I get to step into a really interesting and impactful research project, and unblock or build upon it using my tech/CS background. Or, I get to learn about interesting research and apply a computational lens to it. When my days are like this, the adage “Find work you love and you will never work a day in your life” really feels true.

But, this is not every day. Sometimes I’ll go weeks or months without one of these days, and it sucks. Just like my old job, there are some projects that are isolating, chaotic, or too unstructured. On these days, it can feel like work is work, and FI is the only way to achieve balance.

Add in life changes due to the pandemic, and it’s been a really rough few months. (To be clear, the pandemic had not started when I accepted the job offer. I’m not sure how that would have affected my decision-making, but I’m sure it would have shaken things up a bit.)

While it has only been 9 months, and some of the most unprecedented months at that, these are the lessons I’ve learned about taking the leap for a more fulfilling job. These are as much lessons about myself as they are about the world I live in; I’m sure some of these simply do not apply to you, but I like to think that some of you will benefit from reading this. I repeat: I do not claim these to be universal truths.

##Purpose and fulfillment are forward-thinking, long-term concepts, not something that is lived day to day

When I started this job, I’ll admit a part of me expected everyday to be dramatically more fulfilling than my old job. This is simply not the case. Yes, some days are exhilarating in a way that my old job never could be, but many days are not. That being said, when I think about what I could accomplish in 3, 5, or 10 years at this current position, I am significantly more content with the possibilities here than at my old job. When I think about the experience I am getting at this job, I know that it’s putting me on a track toward being the professional/field-expert I want to be - even if I were to end up changing jobs or the company dies.

I now believe that this is what purpose and fulfillment from a career means for me. It doesn’t mean changing someone’s life every single day - though I imagine it could be like that in other fields like medical professions or social work, for instance. But, even those fields, I imagine, are going to have down days where even the best efforts don’t seem to make a difference (… and that’s all I’ll project onto professions I have no experience in). You need to be fulfilled by the long term potential, because day-to-day wins/losses are not going to be sustainably fulfilling.

##A fulfilling job is still a job

Some of my projects are less interesting than others. Sometimes I have to work on a project that I don’t think has a lot of potential for impact. Sometimes a project is isolating or poorly managed. Some days I feel like a codemonkey/grunt and not the creative professional I strive to be. During my first several months, these realities hit hard. I thought, “Why am I doing this when I know I’m capable of doing better things?”

What I’ve learned is that sometimes it’s best to take a step back, sort of put yourself on autopilot with your job, and put less symbolic meaning into it. Similar to how you set up auto-deposits into your market accounts, you have to look towards the future and ask yourself, “Is the direction I am headed toward one that I am proud of? Will it, to the best of my knowledge, give me experiences that I want to have had in the long term?” If the answer is yes, let that be the end of it: treat your job like a job and let your time on it accumulate. Have no expectations about your day to day experience. Just like the market, my workdays have dramatic up and down swings. I have to assume that if I am properly allocated (metaphorically), my professional “net worth” will trend upward, and not let myself feel despair during a “crash.” (I hope this metaphor makes sense…)

Another way of thinking about this: internal motivation is not always reliable. Some days I’m not super motivated to work on projects that I actually really like. On these days, I’m reminded that a fulfilling job is still a job, and to expect otherwise can lead to disappointment. I try not to lose sight of the fact that I am where, to the best of my knowledge, I want to be - even if it occasionally does not feel like it.

##Being around people who share your values is extremely important, but it’s not all that matters

One of the things I love about my job is that everyone in the org is dedicated to the organization’s goals, and these goals are ones that strongly resonate with me. The same could not be said, IMO, about my old job. However, there are much fewer people with my professional background (software/CS) here than my old job, and sometimes that can be isolating. Especially when working on less desirable projects.

I knew from the get-go that there would be fewer devs I’d be interacting with, but that didn’t stop it from getting a bit painful at times. Thankfully, I have been able to advocate with some success that we get more engineers on a project. And, there is some reasonable expectation of growth in the next year, such that we should be able to hire a few more devs I will work closely with.

I guess the advice here is do not expect that being around people with shared values will always be an adequate substitute for the kind of collaboration that only comes from working with people with a similar professional background. You need both.

##You may still need to seek out external professional development in order to meet your goals

One of my goals when I got my new job was to learn about new fields. In particular, social sciences. At first, I thought that given the dramatic career shift I made, I would meet this goal primarily through my work. And, some days I do. But, as is becoming a trend in this post, this is not always my daily experience. I have decided to pursue extension school classes in psychology to fill this goal so that I can reliably fulfill it. I plan to get a certification in the next year or two, and potentially continue to a master’s degree over the next five years. I took a class last spring, and while I did not take a class this fall, I have decided to dedicate some time everyday to reading a textbook or research paper in an area of my interest. This way, I am meeting my learning goal nearly every day, even on days when I am not learning on the job. I find it essential to set up a routine where I am *reliably* fulfilling this goal, otherwise I get very down.

##You won’t feel fulfilled by your job if you are not happy with your home life

The pandemic is a good case study for this. The last several months have been very destabilizing to my home environment, and this made it really difficult to tolerate downswings at work. There has, at times, been a temptation to quit and try something else. But, in retrospect, this temptation came more from the uncertainty about the world and what my personal life would look like in it. My SO and I have made a lot of changes to adapt to a COVID-19 world, and I can say that finally having what feels like a stable and pandemic-safe home-life balance really alleviates my temptation to run. Sometimes I think I feel a temptation to leave work just so that I can feel like, for a second, I have control over my life during a time in which there are such extreme external circumstances that are outside of my control.

##If you think you cannot apply your skillset/experience to a new field, you are probably wrong

When I started looking for other jobs, I thought I wouldn’t be able to do the kind of work I wanted without going back to school. But that was not the only option, and it probably is not for most people considering a career change. Do the legwork to find organizations that resonate with you, and reach out to see if/how you can apply your background.

##Sometimes things work out in unexpected ways, so have faith

I felt stuck in a project that really didn’t resonate with me for a while. But I kept working on it, even though there were times where I dragged my feet. I didn’t want to make a stink when I was so new to the job. Over time, though, it became clear that this project could have other applications that actually much more strongly aligned with my interests. And, other parties started to become very interested in these new applications. I still have some reservations, but, overall, a situation that felt a bit bleak did get better.

I’ll remember this in the future, and try not to get too down about situations that feel bad in the moment.

##Great managers exist and are so much better than good managers

At my old job, I had three managers. One was OK - his management style did not mesh well with me, but I think it was a style that worked for some. The other two were pretty good. It’s hard to think of complaints. But my current manager continuously surprises me with their level of understanding and compassion. I feel much more at ease discussing issues that I am facing because I know I will be listened to without judgement.

#The verdict: Was it worth it?

The short answer is that 9 months is not enough time to definitively judge if it was worth it. But, I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in these 9 months (as we all have), and I can say that I am still very hopeful about the future, even if I did have some less hopeful moments. I’ve done some really cool things, and I feel good about the direction I’m headed. Additionally, my salary was raised to 93k (from 88k), and there are plans that, if go well, may increase my salary to 120k in 2021. So, it’s within the realm of possibility that I could still be making a reasonably competitive salary again one day…

And yet, the money feels more like a perk than the main draw to the job. I’ve made peace with some of the realities that I was maybe too idealistic about in the beginning, but my level of existential contentment is still much higher than it was. I’m at a point where I feel reasonably confident that this career switch was a good choice in my life. And, if I can feel that way even when we are knee-deep in a pandemic, I think it’s likely a reliable assessment.

Edit/TLDR: The positives seem to have outweighed the negatives for now, but there were still negatives and it is still a job. I'm happy I made the leap; the grass is greener but not in quite all the ways I had hoped.",financialindependence

437,"35, $1.1M - Luck, Stumbles, Dedication, and Thrift - An 11 Year Journey to FI",,1913,adj08l,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/,1546876748.0,"# Goal of this Post

I want this post to share my story on how I achieved FI. I don't want to focus on the individual line items in my budget or my investment allocation, because this is covered in so many other posts, but what I want to do is describe various aspect of my journey, filled with excitement, failure, and all sorts of unknown. I hope that I can help some people who are at various stages of their journey gain some tips and get reassurances that you can and will fail, but you can pick yourselves up and succeed. I've broken up the post into my background and four themes of Luck/Chance, Stumbles, Dedication, and Thrift to outline how each of these affected my path to FIRE.

# Background

35, renter living in near a HCOL US city, SINK, and don't plan to ever have any kids. I'm a 2nd generation immigrant raised in a middle to upper middle class lifestyle. I have not received any inheritances and did not have any trust funds, but I certainly grew up in a household with good parenting and financial stability. As of January 1st, 2019 my NW is $1.1M and I plan to live off a \~3% withdrawal rate - I'm a bit risk averse, so I want a lower rate in case costs go up, stock market goes down, etc. 

*Disclaimers: I have worked very hard, but 100% acknowledge that I've been very privileged with my upbringing and support I've had from friends and family in additional to many lucky circumstances I've had. In fact, in my first section, you'll see all of the ways that I my FI journey has been filled with chance/luck that helped me get to where I am today.*

# Luck

*Luck Definition - I know there was a recent thread that generated a lot of discussion about luck and I'd like to address what I mean by luck. To me, luck is any factor that is 100% out of your control including, but not limited to, genetics, socio/economic environment, or simply crazy things that happen in life. Yes, everyone will have various  lucky and unlucky things in life, but I think it is a disservice to assume that people are dealt an equal hand and their success is simply built upon their dedication and hard work.*

**Born in the USA -** Both my parents were independently able to escape the same war-torn, third world country and successfully immigrate to the US.  I can't do each of their stories justice in this post, but it's safe to say that either could have died or never it made over to the US. As an adult, I visited their home country and saw the staggering amount of poverty and it made me realize how different my life would have been if my parents didn't make it out and I was born there. My first stroke of luck in life was simply the fact of winning the birth lottery and being born in the USA.

**In my DNA -** My parents have always commented that I've been a saver ever since I was a kid. There is a great home video of me at 5 years old getting a $20 bill and I was super excited to put it into my piggy bank - saving just came naturally to me. Where many of my friends' families would go out to eat and go on yearly trips to Hawaii/Disneyland, I was also raised with a modest lifestyle with home-cooked dinners almost every night and our summer trips would be road/camping trips at nearby State/National parks.

**College Rejection -** I was rejected from all 3 of my ""reach"" schools - Harvey Mudd, MIT, and CalTech and ended up going to my safety school, a solid top 50 national public university an hour drive from home. At the time I was upset, but in retrospect getting rejected was probably one of the best things to ever happen to me. With part time jobs, lots of merit and need based financial aid, and the fact that the school tuition was only $5K/year (compared to $35K for MIT), I was able to graduate with no debt.

**Parents Divorcing -** This was very sad at the time, but ultimately what was best for my both parents and my siblings. An unexpected benefit of the divorce was that my college costs got reduced significantly. Through the divorce, my mom got a house which was fully paid off. Because of the illness that she had at the time, she wasn't working which meant no income outside of alimony/child support. The way FAFSA rules were written, my financial aid numbers ended up looking crazy bad (good) and I got a significant amount of need based financial aid even though she was relatively secure. I obviously wouldn't want anyone's family to get divorced, or so sick that they couldn't work, but it was a stroke of chance that all those things coalesced which resulted in me getting huge amounts of need based financial aid on top of my merit based financial aid. 

**Falling into my Job -** I've been at my current (and only post-college) job for 11+ years and I was literally within an hour to not even applying. I had applied to a number of places but didn't apply to this company because I literally didn't want to write a cover letter. My friend who wanted me to apply, asked me in the computer lab 45 minutes before the application was due to apply because he really thought I would be a good fit for the role, so I wrote the cover letter in 15 minutes, submitted the application and after a series of interviews, I ended up getting the job! It's crazy to think that without my friend or being 45 minutes later, I could have had a MUCH different outcome.

Also I was tremendously lucky on where I ended up taking my job. I had grown up and went to school in the same area, so I really wanted to move somewhere else for a change of pace. After receiving my offer, I asked to be staffed in ""a large coastal city"" which had work in the resources/energy industries and they ended up offering me the current city that I live in. I didn't know what I wanted at the time, but looking back, I feel very fortunate that the recruiter picked the city I'm now living in. It really happened to match what I value also is a HCOL city that I could get a high base pay and have a high savings rate.

# Stumbles

**""The Talk"" -** After some generic training I go to work with a client  in an area I really had zero experience. For fresh collge graduates, work at my company is pretty much all ""trial by fire"". After a few weeks of work, my supervisors pulled me aside and had a private conversation that can be summarized with ""hungn3, we brought you onto this role because we thought that you can do the work, but so far you haven't demonstrated that you are able to do it"".

SHIT. I already felt like I had imposter syndrome, but now they validated that I wasn't doing a good job. This was the first time in my life that I was not successful in something that I did and it was a rough hit to my ego. But I buckled up, worked extra hard, was very meticulous with my work, asked for help from my peers/supervisors, and eventually made it through that project successfully. I wasn't going to get ranked at the top of my peer group that first year or two, but I kept my job through the Great Recession in 2008/2009 when people were getting fired left and right.

**Betting Against the Market -** I was convinced the world was going to end in 2008/2009 after reading all sorts of doom/gloom blogs and kept on reading more stuff to confirm my position. I ""invested"" $25K in an ETF with a ticker of SDS. For those unfamiliar, SDS is a ETF that is a derivative and attempts to track *2X the INVERSE of the S&P500*.  I bought it in 2009 in the $80-$115 range and didn't sell it off until 2012 when it was around $12. I felt stupid, especially since I had literally read ""The Bogleheads Guide to Investing"" less than a year earlier. I thought I was smarter than everyone else and could beat what was shown to be statistically/empirically better.

**Fear of investing -** After losing money by making terrible investment decisions, I basically went into turtle mode and decided not to invest in anything outside of my 401K and my discounted company stock purchases for over 3 years. I ended up with over $200K in cash sitting in a savings account making less than 0.5% before I finally pulled the trigger to put it back into the stock market. I missed out on tons of growth opportunity because I was scarred from making terrible individual stock choices.

# Dedication

**The Corporate Ladder Grind -** I've only worked at one company in the 11 years since graduating and work in the IT industry but am not a software developer. I didn't have a typical 9-5 job and often put in nights and weekends during critical phases of the project sacrificing a lot of the ""life"" in the work/life balance equation. At one point on a large project, I was on a call with India at 7AM-8AM, worked at the office from 8AM-10PM, got on call with India from 11PM-midnight and then went directly to bed. This was repeated every day over multiple weeks and wore me down. Since then, I've found that I've been able to enforce boundaries better and ensure that I have a better work-life balance, but my job is still a lot of work and stress. Within 9 years, got 3 major promotions, saw my salary increase from $66K to $182K, and I went from someone who struggled to provide quality deliverables to a person who people seek out for their specific industry/software expertise.

**The Travel Grind -** In my job, I'm required to travel 100% of the time and I have travelled for work for over 10 years, which means flying out and being at the client site from Monday through Thursday. Several sacrifices include not seeing friends/family as often, missing midweek events, and also spending so much of my life on a plane/airport/hotel. The George Clooney movie ""Up in the Air"" really resonated with me and I knew that I couldn't do this life forever and needed to downshift at some point before burning out and turning into Ryan Bingham

I'm both a data and airplane nerd, so I've tracked every flight in my life which you can see at this link: [https://openflights.org/user/hungn3](https://openflights.org/user/hungn3)

# Thrift

**Intentional ""Homelessness"" -** I got an offer to work on a project in NYC for a year.  For most people, that would mean flying coast to coast twice a week. Instead of paying rent despite being so home so seldomly, I instantly decided that instead of paying for more expensive hotels and flying back/forth every week, I would save my company money and myself a ton of money by living in a paid corporate apartment in Midtown Manhattan.  I got to explore NYC for an entire year, trying new food, meeting new people, and seeing new things. After that project, I ended up continuing my ""homeless"" lifestyle by doing one of the following:

1. Staying at the hotel at my client site  and exploring the city where I was working
2. Flying to my home base city and crashing with friends on couches.  I'd compensate them by taking them out to nice dinners and/or cash for staying a few nights before flying back to work.
3. Taking ""flex trips"" to other locations around the US and the world (see below for more details)

I stayed ""homeless"" for about 5 1/2 years, so I got to save a hefty amount by not paying a much rent during that time.

*Note - I use the word ""homeless"" in jest, and do not want to imply that I was anywhere remotely close to experiencing what real homeless people or those living with housing insecurity do.*

**Flex Trips -** One of the biggest perks of my job was that I was able to take flex trips to other destinations as long as the cost of the trip was less than or equal to flying home with any excess paid out of my pocket.  I'd have a ""Go-Bag"" packed under my desk at my client site that I could grab if I wanted to go do a weekend trip. I'd take buses, trains, or even plans to explore places for a weekend. One of my crazier trips was to take a long weekend trip to Belgium and being right back at work on Monday morning. I haven't taken advantage of this much in recent years because I want to re-focus on family/friends, but earlier in my career, I took full use of this perk by traveling all over the US and the world with heavily subsidized flights.

**Miles and Hotel Points -** With all the travel for work, I've accumulated a very nice stash of both airline and hotel points. Where many of my colleagues would use points on business class flights, I couldn't justify that when I could get 2X the number of flights flying economy.  When I did book flights with points, I was able to find great flight plans to maximize my points. One example of ""hacking"" a United Airlines award ticket by using open jaw flights, a stopover, a layover, and careful planning. I got the following flight itinerary all for 80K points + $150 in taxes which on paper is worth about $1000, but I got way more than $1000 value out of it:

* SEA>FRA 23 hour layover to visit friends in Germany
* FRA>IST 10 day stopover to visit Turkey
* IST>NBO 31 day trip across 7 African countries
* JNB>SFO Flight back to the US

**Per Diems** \- As a perk for being on the road, I get a post-tax per diem and can pocket anything I don't use. I would maximize my savings by eating breakfast at the hotel and doing things like meal prep and/or eating frugally while travelling on the road. My per diem varied between $32-$52 per day depending on my travel location. The approximate benefit ends up being \~$8000/year in post-tax dollars or $13,000 in pre-tax dollars.  I absolutely would have spent less on food if I didn't travel, but for people who eat simple food and can figure out other frugal food options, you can pocket a bunch of the per diems.

**No Car and Modest Housing -** To get around, I walk, bike, use mass transit (trains, busses), and will do Lyft/Uber for anything else which the other options don't easily allow. I also will occasionally get a rental car for a long weekend to do a road trip, but that is infrequent.  As for my housing, I live in an older (1970's) 2BR apartment that I share with someone.  Would I love a nice new layout with new hardwood floors, in unit laundry, and updated countertops? 100%! But with what I'm paying, I've determined that getting all those extra items fall into the ""luxury"" category and my space is very functional and large enough to host many friends over for various get-togethers and the location of my place is very walkable to most of the things I need. I was recently at home with my mom and watching shows like Property Brothers and House Hunters, and I couldn't help but laugh at what people deem as ""mandatory features"" for their home.

One thing that I'd like to comment that people often get wrong about HCOL cities is focusing so heavily on the cost of housing.  Of course you want to minimize costs where possible, but it should be to reach a global minimum, not a local minimum.  The point I'd like to make is that you really need to factor in **the total cost of transportation and housing** when deciding where to live, especially since most HCOL areas have relatively good mass transit options. If you can pay an extra $300/month for a better located apartment/house, it might cost you less when you factor in your time, the costs of owning cars, paying for transit etc.

Also, it is possible to have access to most of the benefits of a HCOL city, without actually living directly in that city.  In my case I'm about a 30 minute train ride into the city and will often go to meet up with friends, get dinner, etc., but pay significantly less rent than those who live in the city.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Life is complicated and there is no ""one"" path to success, nor are any of the paths clear.  I had a lot of luck, stumbled along the way, dedicated a lot of my time towards achieving FI via my career, and found many ways to save money.

***Update #1:***

People wanted some numbers for salary/networth/budget so here they are.  I still suggest you read the body of the post as that has a lot of good info :-).

\* May be inaccurate due to general unreliability [Mint.com](https://Mint.com).

Net Worth only includes base salary but does not include bonuses, 401K match, ESPP discount, per diems, or any other bonus/perk I may have received.  I didn't track my savings rate, so I don't have a breakdown of amount saved vs. investment gains.

# Spending

People seemed interested on my spending and how I could keep it to \~$33K. Below is my actual 2018 spending along with my FIRE budget.  I had to go to the ER in 2018 and get a few CT scans, so I had a surprise $2000 bill.  I would say this isn't typical, but I treat it more as a random one time expense. 2018 total costs roughly reflect the average spending each year

|Year|Rent + Utilities|Fun|Food|Travel|Clothes|Health|Transportation|Gifts|Other|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018 Actual|7858|3880|5786|1832|1390|3744|703|809|5330|31332|
|FIRE Budget|9000|4200|6000|4800|600|1850|1800|600|4800|33650|

Note: Healthcare will be kept low with ACA subsidies by planning of capital gains/losses and I have low transportation costs because I don't own a car and I ride my bike/use mass transit.

***Update #2:***

Wanted to address a few common questions that came up in a single update instead of commenting in each post.

**Are you really FI?** \- Yes. Based on my spending rate today (see above) I generate enough with a 3.0% WR and I actually think I'm being a bit conservative given various CFIRE and other simulation tools.  Some people may consider it leanFIRE simply based on my spending rate - I see the definition of <$40K on the leanFIRE subreddit, but this is probably for a family, and I'm spending $33K as a single person. **I feel like I've got a pretty damned good life with my current level of spending.**  Maybe you can't enjoy life with that much, but I certainly can!

**Will you retire early? -**  I currently plan to take some time off my job (either LOA or quitting) and see where things go.  I feel pretty comfortable to RE on my current savings.  However, it doesn't mean this is my final decision - that's the beauty of FI, you have the freedom to change your mind pretty easily!  My future could include more work, such as going back at the same compan/type of company with more conditions/constraints (part time/less travel), doing short term independent consulting work, finding other work I might enjoy more, or continuing the RE path.

**Free time?** \- I plan to just do a lot of relaxing, hanging out with friends more, dating, rock climbing, cooking more, and catching up on my video game/board game/movie/tv/book backlogs. I'll be looking to also volunteer for a variety of 2019 and 2020 elections.",financialindependence

Just to be clear, I am not asking for legal advice, I now have a lawyer. My reason for posting was to share my experience. Not looking for pity from the community, just sharing which I thought reddit was all about. If this gets clipped, I guess my experience on these subs is skewed somehow.

My original post:

Sorry for the downer post. I posted here less than a month ago and got a lot of insightful replies and suggestions. At that time I had no idea this was coming today.

Marriage can be a complicated road to travel. Lots of bumps and turns over the last 26 years of it. Mine will be coming to a stop soon and I will either make a right or left.

My thoughts about FI or even RE are not what got me here. But, here I am and will be making a new plan after the dust settles. Getting late in the game for me to recover easily but I will put in what it takes to do so.

Just a point to consider for the younger crowd about how things can change and an illustration of how your best laid out plan can fail. It can be health related, relationship related and so many other things.

EDIT: Didn't expect this post to blow up like this. Was busy today meeting with counsel and discussing the situation. Realistically, I was advised that of course 50% of all assets will be divided. Also told the variable is in alimony awarded. Will be 50% of my income at the least and can last from 8 years to perpetuity (i.e. until I die) based on the length of the marriage. That point was the tough one to hear. The journey has just begun so I will buckle in and get ready for the ride.

Many, many thanks for all the comments. I can't possibly reply to each individually, but trust I have read them all. Some made me laugh, some made me cry and some left me scratching my head. Lol. I feel compelled to update as time goes on, and I will let everyone that cares to know, know what the status is. Thanks again reddit FIRE community, your comments mean a lot to me right now.",financialindependence
439,"Top reasons parents don’t discuss wealth with their children, but should",,1905,clvsoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/clvsoz/top_reasons_parents_dont_discuss_wealth_with/,1564921876.0,"Two-thirds of Americans who have at least $3 million in investable assets have not talked to their children about their wealth or never will, according to a Merrill Private Wealth Management [study of 650 families](https://www.pbig.ml.com/articles/how-do-families-make-effective-wealth-decisions.html). Also [discussed here](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/your-money/parenting-wealth-discussions.html).

Top reasons for not discussing money with children:

1. Parents do not want inheritance to rob children of motivation.
2. Talking about wealth often increases a parent’s anxiety.
3. Sometimes, parents avoid the discussion because they do not know the answers or even how much money they have.
4. They don’t come from generational wealth, so they didn’t have these conversations themselves growing up.

But despite these reasons they say it’s important to have discussions about wealth:

> Families that inherit wealth often continue to be wealthy because of the conversations they have...
>
> These families, he said, follow a three-step process: Educate their children about finances and wealth, communicate the family’s values, and hire good advisers.
>
> Those who do not succeed in passing money along successfully often have silence to blame.
>
> “The generation that receives the money has no education and no skills and wakes up like a lottery winner,” Mr. LaFond said. “You don’t want your kids to be lottery winners.”",financialindependence
440,"don't ever give up, and don't ever compare yourself to other people",,1888,bo2mpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bo2mpa/dont_ever_give_up_and_dont_ever_compare_yourself/,1557749211.0,"Posting from a throw-away account to share some deep / honest thoughts, random stream of consciousness below - apologies in advance for some incoherent thoughts:

&#x200B;

Reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bnrhq3/vent_frustrated_with_where_i_am_feels_like_fi_is/) kind of broke my heart a little, and a short time later, a long time good friend texted me, and told me he was laid off from a very long time job (more than 10 years) making decent money.  It made really think about life and career.  I want to share this message that got me to the success that I have today:  don't ever give up, and don't ever compare yourself to other people.

&#x200B;

I fell asleep Sunday night early, very tired, and had some strange dreams on my own. I woke up in the middle of the night, fresh from a dream where I was laid off from a great job making great money, feeling completely lost and depressed about my situation.  It took a few minutes for me to realize I was dreaming and the emotions felt so real, but it was not reality.  I had a whirlwind of thoughts about life, work, and happiness that I thought I'd share here to help others who may be lost.

&#x200B;

A little bit about me:  grew up very poor, worked in minimum wage jobs throughout high school / college.  In 40's, with bachelor's degree & masters degree, in a business role that requires me to publicly advise top organizations around the world.  I've made it to FI (not yet RE yet), but always very private and never shared my success / wealth publicly (even among family / friends).  Net worth over $2m in LCOL state.  Income over $200k / year, but always saved like crazy until the last few years (will explain why below).   The reason I don't share my finances / wealth with others close to me is because I never want my friends / family to feel inadequate, and I really don't care how much better / worse off financially other people are to me as well...it has nothing to do with me and all it will do is make me feel worse or superior, both of which are not positive emotions.  (Side note - in today's unhealthy Instagram / social media psychotic environment, I could make a really baller account to show off some baller lifestyle moments / toys if I really chose to, but I really hate it and this is my story why)

&#x200B;

I am usually a very confident person, since I really don't care about what other people think of me, or how they are doing financially compared to me, and I just focus on doing the best I can at work, as well as personally, no matter what. However, reading the information above, and getting the text from my good friend, played with my mind a little.  My surreal dream was so emotional, feeling the impact of being told that I'm being laid off from my great job making $200k per year, feeling completely lost about my identity and future, being so depressed that I felt as if I had no value or worth.  It caused me to really think about how I got to where I am, and how money didn't define who I am or what my worth is.

&#x200B;

First of all, money is only a tool, and most of us have our most basic needs met - Food and Shelter.  Anything above that is pure gravy.  Social media / advertising makes us feel so damn inadequate if we don't have this or that...it's all complete BS.  At the end of day, we are all microbes traveling on a tiny dust ball in space that no one could give a shit about 100 years from now, never mind hundreds / thousands of years from now.  Who cares if you have $10, $100, $1 million, or $1 billion?  It's all insignificant compared to the realities of the universe - the unfathomably long span of time from the birth of the universe to the eventual heat death of the universe.  Our lives are so short and insignificant in comparison.   Important - yes, significant - no.  Enjoy this journey of life and don't waste a second comparing your social status, finances, or anything else to anyone else, who have their successes and worries that are consuming their lives as much as you are.

&#x200B;

Focus on what's truly important in life - family, love, relationships, your health (eat as healthy as you can, exercise as best as you can).  Make the best of the short twinkle of time you will have on this amazing planet.  Don't worry about what you don't have, as much as what you are blessed with (most of which money cannot buy, such as family / love / health).  The person who has the best relationships, love, and health is the richest person in the world, regardless of how much money is in their possession.

&#x200B;

Always strive to learn, and be bold.  Part of my reason for success is because I don't spend a lot of time being ""entertained"" with TV or mass media.  I selective control what I watch / read / absorb to ""program"" my mind.  I value being exposed to educational materials about science, technology, health, nutrition.  I try to block out politics, sports, and other potentially addictive but non-helpful content that will distract my mind but not be helpful in my personal growth.  You must figure out what your top priorities are, and plan your reading / video watching / social media exposure around this.  This is probably the number one reason people are so unhappy today - they allow uncontrolled sources to program their minds by default - allowing whatever random news, politics, social media to enter their lives and control their thoughts and dictate their behavior.  We are what we allow our minds to be exposed to. Only allow positive and educational content to be the majority of your exposure, kill / stop other mindless ""entertainment"" from aimlessly driving your thoughts / feelings.

&#x200B;

In my line of work, I have to be in front of the public / colleagues constantly.  Fear of public speaking is one of the biggest fears people have. I chose to tackle that head on and become one of the best public speakers.  I still think I'm a shitty speaker but people apparently love my presentations.  I chose to work on my public speaking skills all the time, the same as an elite athlete continues to practice all the time on his / her skills to stay on top.  The best advice I can give to anyone is the following:  never be afraid at work, work boldly and innovate all the time.  Do what you think is best, while learning from those who are more successful than you.   I work with so many people at work who are afraid of being different.  The ones who truly succeed are the ones who actually are bold and take risk to expose themselves to possible failure, but grow over time and become unstoppable because they conquer their fears, every day.  No one gives a shit if you stumble on something at work as long as you learn from it and keep getting better.  However if you play it safe at work, never risk failure, and stay under the radar, you will never rise above your potential and get ahead.

&#x200B;

We tend to undervalue our worth in life.  Each one of us has incredible unique gifts and talents, that when properly capitalized on, can bring incredible rewards in career and personal value.  I have many strengths and weaknesses that no one else has.  No one can replicate what I bring to the table, and conversely, I can never replicate what you bring to the table.  We are all in our individual journeys in life.  Therefore, to compare yourself to others purely on something as superficial as money / wealth, is an illusion and a horrible way to beat yourself up if you should find that you don't quite measure up on this singular insignificant measuring stick.

&#x200B;

Learn to enjoy life and enjoy the journey to success.  As I mentioned above I made it to FI(RE) status, but I chose to spend a decent amount of my worth on something that means a lot to me personally.  I gave myself permission to buy a nice toy a few years ago (an exotic sports car), because I love cars, and life is short so why not make a choice to enjoy something that modern humans have only really appreciated in the last 100 years or so?   I don't go around being flashy with my car.  Most of my family live in towns away from  me and they do not know I have such a car.  I use it for myself only, and don't show it off to others.  I get tons of attention when I am in the car and I really hate the attention, but I love the thrill it gives me when I'm on a mountain drive all by myself, with my favorite music and just meditating on being alone on the road.  It is probably an irresponsible choice to spend over $200k on a sports car (or any car), but once you get to a certain age, time becomes far more constrained than money.  So don't feel afraid to splurge on yourself / your loved ones.  You are not going to regret having some amazing experiences on your death bed, instead of a huge chunk of money in your account that you never got to enjoy.  Don't obsess over money, obsess over what you make of your time in this short blink of an eye in this amazing universe.

&#x200B;

Sorry for this uber long rant, but I thought I'd share my thoughts with those who seem to be so depressed about where you are in life compared to others.  Remember, what I have, or don't have, means nothing to you.  I could be depressed that Mark Zuckerberg is so much younger than me, millions of times wealthier than me, and just mope around being sad all day.   In reality, I couldn't give a shit what other people have / don't have.  I just focus on what's important to me, my family, and my life.  I've never been happier not giving a shit about what other people have / don't have.

&#x200B;

Best of luck on your journey. Do your best and enjoy this short time you have.",financialindependence

The stress of moving my family, possibly needing to change schools and daycares and leaving the neighbourhood we love has been brutal. We have decided to buy in our neighbourhood.

442,Wife and I quit our jobs to travel the world for a year! Pressing pause on FIRE,,1884,biivjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/biivjy/wife_and_i_quit_our_jobs_to_travel_the_world_for/,1556502839.0,"My wife and I are getting ready to embark on a one year journey across 40 countries. Below is our story of how we got to this point and why we’re doing this now.

Since many in this community love pursuing multi-year goals and travel, I hope you find this helpful if you’re in the middle of your pursuit.

Two years ago (age 28 then), after our trip to Asia, my wife and I decided that we wanted to travel the world for a year. 

A year before that travel conversation, I had been feeling unfulfilled at my job. I’m a creator and entrepreneur at heart, so I decided to build my own e-commerce startup to fill the void outside of my full time job. Given I’m pretty risk averse, I built my small startup on weekends, early mornings and late nights. A few months after launching my startup, I got promoted to Sr. Dir. at the corporation I worked for.  Fast forward a year, and I’m getting burned out trying to lead a team and grow a small business outside of my FT career. Not to mention, I’m still not fulfilled at my full time job.

So, we took a 2 week vacation to Asia to getaway and unwind. Once we got back home, we couldn’t stop talking about how much fun we had and that we wished we could travel for a much longer period of time. We talked about it and thought “why wait until we’re in our 60’s and retired?”

Personally, I grew up in poverty and lived through some bad situations I won’t get into here. I’ve been working since I was 10. My mom passed away suddenly when I was 15 (she was early 40s). Her parents passed away when they were in their early 40s as well. And, my dad’s in rough shape in his early 60s...My brother (1.5 years older than me) joined the Army after high school and did a couple tours in Iraq. I constantly wondered if he’d come home...Thankfully, he did. 

*Thank you to all of you who have or are serving in the armed forces or as a first responder. 

I chose to go to college and pursue a business degree. My career has been good to me, but boy have I put in some hours...

Long story short, it’s been a tough past 15-20 years where I’ve been going 100mph to try and be successful, create wealth and simply enjoy life. Problem is, I’ve been so focused on being successful that I’ve rarely allocated time to enjoy life. To truly live with child-like wonder without worrying about a constant income... 

Given my background, I understand that tomorrow is not guaranteed. We may not live to be 60. And, if we do, we may not have the health to travel the way we want to at that age. So, we decided now is the best time for us to take a sabbatical. 

We don’t have children and we’re still young. The world is our playground.  

With our minds set on traveling, we asked each other “what needs to be true for us to travel the world for one year?” Below was our list. 

1. Eliminate all debt. Between our student loans and vehicles, we had $100K in debt (majority student loans).
2. Fund the year-long trip with our own money, points and miles (I’m a travel hacker). 
3. Have enough liquid savings to last us one year when we come back after the trip.
4. Don’t sacrifice retirement contributions or HSA while employed (last 2 years). 
5. Don’t buy a home, yet.
6. Don’t have kids, yet. 
7. Stay healthy and don’t get injured.

In order to achieve 1-4 above, we sacrificed a lot of normal things. Below is what we did to payoff our debt, save and invest for retirement. 

1. Downsized into a small 1/1 apartment to cut monthly, recurring costs. Sold furniture in the process. 
2. Sold my truck to free up cash to payoff some student loans. 
3. With one vehicle remaining, I took public transportation to work for a year and a half. 
4. Got a Costco membership and ate at home a lot. We ate out a lot less.
5. Didn’t buy any tangible goods or clothes that were not necessary. Our “wants” came as birthday or Christmas gifts. 
6. Didn’t spend a lot on experiences (concerts, movies, events).
7. Cut the cord on cable tv.
8. Got a promotion and raise at FT job. 
9. Sold my startup for a small amount and paid off remaining student loans.
10. Worked a few consulting jobs on the side for startups to earn more money. 
11. Wife worked a lot of different part-time, temp jobs. 

Basically, we took the FIRE path and maintained a very high savings rate with a great income. 

I’m proud to say that we achieved all of our goals. And, after resigning, I’ve officially been unemployed for over a week.

Yes, it’s a wonderful feeling to be able to spend your days doing exactly what you want.

Now, we’re getting ready to take off on our Adventure Year in less than 2 weeks!

I cannot explain the excitement or feeling, but I wish everyone could experience this at least once in their life. 

The last 2 years of working towards our big goal have definitely been worth it. We will pick up FIRE when we get back home. 

If there are big things you want to do that bring you joy, then set a goal, make a plan and work hard to achieve it. You will have to make some sacrifices and likely dedicate years on your journey, but it’s all worth it.

You deserve happiness. We all do.

EDIT: 
Thank you all for the well wishes, celebrations and advice! This community is awesome. I talked to my wife and we’re very open to slowing down our travels as many of you have recommended. 40 countries is definitely a lot to try to visit in a year. We built in flexibility to our plan and are not pre-booking everything so that we can be open to new possibilities. Plus, we have tons of opportunities built in to check-in with each other on how we’re doing and if we want to change our plans along the way, such as staying in one country for a month.

This has been a blessing and I have tried to pay it forward by donating to the local zoo and aquarium, which my family frequent. 

I would like to thank the FI community for keeping my focused on my financial and life goals, despite a small COVID interruption. 

Original post: After coming back to work after a 2 week convalescence, COVID-19 measures are going to make the next few weeks to months really tough. I know my emergency fund is here just for this kind of rainy day, and I am not worried about money. However, while I am lucky to still be able to work, it will be half time, and I'll have to take PTO for the rest of that time (as of right now.)

I have been diligent in building up that PTO for months now and it is about to be robbed from me. I know many people have it worse, but if I was already RE, then I wouldn't even be stressing about this. This means I will be re-doubling my efforts to save more, plan better, and leave this rat race the second I can.",financialindependence
444,Last day of work today. Ever. A few observations....,,1866,ab6py7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ab6py7/last_day_of_work_today_ever_a_few_observations/,1546259506.0,"After nearly 40 years I'm retiring today in my early 50s.  I have noticed a few things that I thought I'd share.

First - we've covered the financial stuff on this sub ad-naseum.  My family will be fine financially.  Similarly medical care, etc. is going to be okay.

That stuff is just business anyway, and we spend far too much time on business in our lives.

The first thing I noticed is that I'm accepting increased *invisibility*.  Not working will mean fewer people come to me for my expertise and guidance.  Fewer accolades and successes in the corporate environment I have embraced for a few decades now.   I'm looking forward to this invisibility and anonymity!  It will give me room to be more authentically 'me'.

I have also noticed that by divorcing my brain from daily work I have allowed more room for thoughts of my family and friends' situations.  I'm already more aware of what is happening around me just from the change in focus.

The final thing I'm noticing, somewhat related to the above, is that I no longer have to keep up that professional wall around me.  I have always maintained a distance from my co-workers, and I see that tendency bleeding over into my home life.  It is difficult when you are required to compartmentalize your thoughts and emotions in order to maintain a professional demeanor.  I'm no longer going to have to do this.

Anyway - Just wanted to share some unique perspectives as a person who finally reached my RE date!",financialindependence

The US Market follows a pretty standard cycle of growth and correction. It would be very unprecedented to not see a major crash for another 10 years.

If you're planning FI/RE based on your growth over only the last nine or so years, your resolve to ""hold during a crash"" will almost certainly be tested in the next ten.

I am a content creator who makes gaming content on Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram. I won't say who I am b/c I don't want my fans, family, and friends knowing how much I make. 

When I started getting popular and making money, my SO and I purchased a house with the intention of paying it off in ~10 years. My popularity increased, and we ended up paying it off in 3. 

I've been in debt my whole life (student loans -> mortgage), but in 2019 for the first time in my life I'm 100% debt free, and it's been slap in the face. Now that I don't have any huge bills to pay, I don't know what to spend the money on. I've been doing a lot of research this past 3 months about money, and have gotten really into FIRE. I make a lot, but content creation is *extremely* unstable. Next year, my income could halve. Maybe it could double. Maybe I could make a viral mistake and my career could be over. So, I want to make the most out of my money now, while I'm in a position to do so.

* In my 30s, married, no kids (but we're trying)
* My 2019 Income: Roughly $90k-110k/month
* SO's Income: 65k/year office job (I'm on their health insurance)
* Assets: $850k house + $30k car, all paid off
* Cash: $192k
* Investments: $34k with American Funds, $31k in a 401k, $4k in a whole life insurance

I think the whole life insurance was a mistake. Might cash out of it b/c everything I'm reading/hearing indicates that whole life is a shit deal. I've offered my SO to quit many times but my SO is fiercely independent and doesn't want to be dependent on me. 

I hired an accountant and investment advisor this year. We had our first meeting just before tax season (taxes for content creators at my bracket are BRUTAL... I wrote a $200k+ check to Uncle Sam last year, fucking ouch). We're meeting again next month. (EDIT: I paid $200k taxes on LAST YEAR'S salary, which was ~500k/year).

So my question is, what do I do with the money in my situation to make the most of it and secure my financial freedom? I'm planning on busting my ass to try to maintain this income for as long as possible, but honestly who knows with streaming? I'm thinking about investing aggressively, putting in maybe like 50k/month. 

I realllllly like the idea of the passive income I've seen a lot on here, where people have a few million invested and draw a salary from it without touching the principal. That would give me the one thing that is critically missing from my job: security.

I hope I'm not coming off badly in this post. I realize my situation is very good and me asking advice might seem silly. It's just, I've been so focused on building the business that I never took the time to learn financial planning, and the incredible instability of my job gives me a constant, nagging fear that it could all come crashing down any day. I just want secure my family's future before viewership starts to dip.",financialindependence

I have 3 jobs and I love them all.

I also do some freelance marketing and have recently started a blog. 

I have 3 kids and I’m saving 40% of my income for FIRE. I know I will achieve FI at some point but I may or may not achieve the RE part since my combined jobs yield me about $70,000 a year and my wife stays at home. I am considering lean options on housing to save more, but I don’t hate work either. I believe her objection is related to having a smaller dwelling, and I am not sure if it’s worth having a smaller home with kids around.

In August I'll finish up my contract, bid farewell to my colleagues and do just that.

I've managed to get myself into this position by following many of the strategies that you guys talk about on this forum. Starting out with nothing at the age of 21 myself and my wife have spent the last 23 years investing surplus savings and being careful with how we spend money whilst raising a family on a single income. I've been working in IT in New Zealand, Australia & Europe for my entire career and most of that time our household income was around US$80,000/annum. It's been really interesting talking to other people who are the same age as I am, who're in the same industry, who've nearly always earned much more then I have yet who are often still deeply in debt and resigned that will need to keep working well into their 60s. I thought I'd share some of the behaviors and decisions that helped us get to where we are now:

1. Buying a cheap house early: We bought a pretty ordinary house in the late 90s for US$125k (in New Zealand) and paid it off in four years. For 15 subsequent years the money which we would have spent on the mortgage or rent was invested, giving us a huge head-start.

2. Tax planning via contracting: I've spent most of my career contracting as a Programmer, Project Manager, Business Analyst etc. Most contracts have been for 6 months on a higher daily rate than a permanent job. Contracting has meant that I've been plan my income across tax years to avoid drifting into high tax rate thresholds. i.e. for many years I'd stop work after 6 months and take the summer off till the next tax year started. Obviously, this isn't the best strategy for simply accumulating money, but it's been a nice lifestyle choice.

3. Buy and Hold. I've found my only investment regrets have come when I've sold and watched as the value of that investment continued to rise. There are lots of shares on the Australian and NZ share markets that pay higher dividends yields than bank interest rates, so it's pretty hard to lose money in the long-term. As I've grown older I've become much more comfortable with buying some ETF or share then forgetting about it and not stressing about whatever the share price is.

4. Start a business. I did this about 6 years ago. It wasn't particularly successful financially and had I just continued contracting it would have resulted in much the same return on investment. However, the personal development & leadership opportunities and connections that I realized from being a business owner were life-changing. It's given me a ton of confidence in looking outside IT for whatever I do next.

So, in just over a month we'll be off to explore this planet with a curious mind and I'll keep myself open to whatever opportunities present themselves. I think that, at 44 years old, FIRE shouldn't be about playing golf or pottering around the home, but instead is an amazing opportunity to escape the daily grind and challenge yourself. Maybe even give back something to the world. We'll see...

449,I originally joined the FIRE movement because I hated my job so much and wanted to retire early. What I found out recently is that I actually just want to achieve enough financial independence (safety net) to turn a passion into profit.

Was just curious if I'm alone here

I've been so focused on optimizing every aspect of my lifestyle it almost became unhealthy. I wondered how sustainable it was because I was killing myself at a job that I hated and still was many years out from reaching my retirement goal.

I realized that it wasn't work itself that I hated but the type of work that I was doing. I decided to adjust my thinking a bit and save enough money for me to take a leap and start my dream venture. I still plan on taking the FIRE principles of frugality, minimalism and maximum savings but for a slightly adjusted goal.

450,Early trick to teaching your kids to save,,1843,9a299d,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9a299d/early_trick_to_teaching_your_kids_to_save/,1535153147.0,"I've been debating sharing with this forum our experience in teaching kids how to save. ultimately, I think there are a lot of us here with kids (we're just too busy to post much), and I certainly love reading posts about people with kids and how they manage their FIRE methods. My hope in sharing this is that it'll be helpful to others and maybe even improve on the technique (and share if you do!).

​

My husband and I are both avid stalkers of this forum and have been saving for years. Neither of us got any formal teaching in how to save - we just observed our parents making frugal choices and not overly-stressing over money and that more-or-less got the message through to us by mid-adulthood. Now we have 4 kids and we've been trying to figure out how to make the desire to save ingrained in a more proactive manner. I've read *""The Opposite of Spoiled""* and while we love the idea, our kids are ultimately still too young (our kids are 5 and 2.5).

​

Here's where we stumbled on a surprisingly successful idea. We had been using ""tokens"" - ie poker chips - to reward good behavior. Start the day with 3 tokens and earn a token every time you do a big helper job (like taking out the recycle) or lose a token if you're unkind or disobedient. Tokens are not given out for their chores - each kiddo has chores they have to do every day and tokens are not awarded for those jobs done; we didn't want to get into a ""pay me for doing any work around the house"" scenario. We frequently remind them that the chore list grows as they get older and they've seen it happen, but because we by-large do chores as a family, there has been zero push back when we transfer jobs from token-earning to regular-chores. At the end of the day, the tokens are cashed in for sugar of various forms: right now a jelly bean is 1 token, a buttermint is 2 tokens, and an oreo is 5 tokens. The kids typically end up with a range between 3-7 tokens; on really great days they'll break 10.

​

This worked pretty well for behavior adjustment, and then one of our 5 year olds had a really good day (lots of sugar at the end) and decided she didn't want to eat it all. She got a bowl with her name on it, and she saved the extra. We told her she could eat it the following day whenever she wanted - that it was hers. Our other 5 year old wanted a bowl with her name on it too, but (we were becoming wise) we told her she could only have a bowl if she saved. Now we had two kids saving candy day over day.

​

They started telling the two 2.5 year olds how *awesome* it is to be able to eat candy the next day whenever you want. The littles tried it once, but ultimately instant gratification would win out. Then I decided to introduce interest. Our new rule is: if you save at least one jelly bean or half an oreo through breakfast the next day, you get *another* jelly bean in your bowl. This was life-changing for the littles - they now regularly save over and above what they have to and sometimes ask for their bowls just to count their candies. EDIT: I've had a few ask so clarification: interest is only 1 jelly bean total, no compounding :)

​

At one point my 5 year olds took their candy bowls downstairs in the evening to play video games with me and ate all of their candy at once. I had warned them that it's easy to eat more than you expect while watching TV but ultimately we let them learn simple lessons the active way. And it was so exciting the next day to hear them comment to each other things like, ""We shouldn't have taken our candy downstairs."" ""Yea, my bowl is empty and I'm sad.""

​

""*The Opposite of Spoiled""* is a great book and we'll definitely be applying it as the kids get older but my initial mistake was using cash - a currency kids just don't care about. By introducing small amounts of sugar as a currency instead, I feel like we're early on teaching them about the joys of surplus and the avoidance of instant gratification. What's more, they now have the terminology already in place - we talk about saving candy for later, earning interest on it. The hope is that they will have an active understanding of the power of saving from toddlerhood on.

I was a gymnast in college and got a degree in Engineering.  Always wanted to coach but also knew pay wasn't good.  Could have made really good money as engineer in private world but worked for the city because it had good hours that allowed me to coach.  Liked my engineering job but passion always been coaching.  At times had some pretty good athletes, I was working 40+ as engineer and 20+ as coach but loved it.  Offered college coaching jobs but turned down because I was getting close to the idea of a pension.  Liked my engineering except last few years got hard with the hours and getting older (and dealing with people at the day job). Realized I can't physically or emotionally do both anymore.

&#x200B;

This week marks my 30th year.  Could stay longer and make a lot more money (my pension and salary for 5 years). Decided I am just going to coach.  So have pension making about 75% what I make now with day job with health, side hustle of coaching of 15 hours or so, about 450k in deferred comp, and paid off house.  Some mistakes I made along the way was buying cars i didn't need and a big boat.  Although the boat is isn't a bad purchase since its something I  really  love to do and I spend every summer weekend on it.  Although it is a ton of money, for my sanity it is worth it. I would have a ton more money in my deferred comp now if I didn't have a boat, but I would have been a lot less happy.

&#x200B;

Few years ago, started to help out crossfit athletes.  Lead to me giving clinics when I want (nice money just don't have time to give more).  Also got fairly big on instagram posting drills and have a side hustle with that making 400-500 a month.    When I started to help crossfitters other coaches made fun of me - but I knew i could turn it into a viable side hustle.  Moral of story - if you put some time into something you like doing you can make money on it.

My plans for future? Coach 15 (maybe more) hours a week, put more time into my online tutorial/instagram to see if it can grow, travel, boat a heck more, and am getting a puppy Monday!

We’ve all been saying that we would, but the rubber is meeting the road now and we’re all going to be tested.

An excerpt from a book review in the news today.,,1823,bcfqus,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bcfqus/whats_the_point_of_wealth_an_excerpt_from_a_book/,1555087449.0,"Early in my career I worked at an old fashioned savings and loan bank. We offered the best rates in town, and this attracted a certain kind of customer. One emblematic individual was Mr. Tonlin. He was meticulous in his management of his $4,000,000, which was divided among fifty or so accounts with different maturity dates. He would come in every week with his list on a clipboard held proudly to his chest and carefully make decisions about which ones to get, haggling with management for better rates. He carried the air of a business magnate from the Industrial Revolution. This was his pride and joy. Then, after years of this routine, his wife passed away.

Mr. Tonlin came in the afternoon after the funeral—perhaps to get some grounding in his routines. He seemed like he had lost six inches of height. He came into the bank lobby expressionless, posture limp, disoriented. Various staff came up to him, expressing their condolences. He ambled to the counter holding his clipboard, which now seemed to be very heavy to him. We waited for him to say something as he looked at the list. Then quietly, looking down at his clipboard, his chin quivered and his eyes welled up, “I should have spent this money with her. What am I going to do with it?”

It’s been over a decade since this happened. I would bet that a week hasn’t gone by that I haven’t thought of that man and this single phrase.

After telling my clients this story, I repeated the question to these trailer park millionaires, “What’s the point?”

I believe that those who have saved up deserve the reward of minimizing their fears about money while maximizing their energy for the real things of life. Ask yourself: what is the point? This is not a rhetorical question. If you and I optimize your financial life, leaving no stone unturned, what’s the point? What would change? What should change? 

To me, the point is this: you should have the luxury of diverting your emotional energy away from worrying about money. Spend that same energy on more important things like family and friends, pursuing goals and experiences, enjoying life, or giving back to the world. The emotional cost of financial chaos is profoundly impoverishing. Bringing order to chaos will enable you to divert your energy to the things that enrich your life.

Financial strength is not about having a lot of money. The ancient Romans had a saying, “Money is like seawater. The more you drink, the thirstier you become.” As you grow in wealth, you must also grow in wisdom.

Spoiler: I'm loving the FIRE and don't have any plan to go back to work at all!  I've put the TL;DR up front, but I've got a lot more details below if you're interested in reading those!

* After taking an 11 month Leave of Absence, I officially gave my notice and my last day of employment was in early January.
* My net worth went from $1.10M to $1.40M with a few paychecks, cashing out a ton of PTO, a small annual bonus, and a surging stock market. With my current budget of $33K/year, this would amount to a 2.37% withdrawal rate, which for someone who is risk averse (especially given the long bull run in the past decade and valuations where they are currently at) is very comforting.
* 2019 Actual budget was only $500 above planned and I found that a lot of my planned budget categories costs were higher than my actual spend.
* Overall, I'm extremely happy with my decision to RE - I can spend more time with my hobbies, friends, and [pursue things that are bringing more meaning to my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dbcrtr/giving_after_fire_1_month_volunteering_at_summer/). I know there have been a few recent posts about not being happy after RE, but I'm truly enjoying all of it and not finding any boredom whatsoever!
* I applied and got accepted to a second LGBT summer camp as a cabin counselor! I've got 3 days at a spring camp, 3 weeks with Summer Camp #1, and 5 weeks with Summer Camp #2.  With training for each of the camps, it'll be 68 days of volunteering this summer!
* Major goal this is to get better at climbing (leading sport and trad climbs outdoor at 5.10b-5.10d level) so I can apply to be an outdoor instructor at Outward Bound or NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School).

In the rest of the post I will cover the following topics: Major FIRE actions, Quality of Life Update, Budget in FIRE, Goals for Year 2 of FIRE,  Notable Experiences Since my Last Update, and Notable Events/Trips for 2020. So read on for more details!

# Major FIRE actions

* Moved 401k to Vanguard IRA rollover account. This gave me some anxiety because a mid 6-figure check was sent via snail-mail. o\_O
* Changed taxable investments to not auto-invest to get a cashflow source not that I'm not generating a salary.  I got $18K in dividends from my taxable accounts last year, most of it qualified.
* After lots of research and debating pros/cons, I decided to balance health care costs, present taxes, with future taxes and am targeting an AGI of $30,200 next year.  I will have the roughly $18K in dividends (based on 2019) and $12,200 of of IRA to Roth IRA rollover income. If dividends come in lower than $18K, I will sell of some mutual funds to get LT capital gains to make up the difference. **My estimated 2020 tax at that income level will be $975 ($400 Federal and $575 State).** The $30.2K AGI puts me in the top range for the Silver 73 CSR subsidy range. I hypothetically had the option to keep my premium to $1/month with super low deductibles and out of pocket costs, but it didn't leave any headroom to convert IRA to Roth IRA. Ultimately, I chose to pay a higher health insurance premiums ($474/year instead of $12/year), which is effectively a 3.80% tax to rollover $12.2K to Roth IRA.  
* Signed up for ACA covereage started Feb 1st for $39.50/month for a Silver 73 HMO with CSR with $3700/$375 deductible with fixed fee co-pays for normal doctor visits and labs/tests. There were issues with the website so I had to call in via phone to continue the application. Also, I had to talk to them and insist/clarify that I no longer had health insurance at work  - they input it into the system that I still had a job and it was going to cost me something like $500+/month.

# Quality of Life Update

I definitely don't feel any guilt about not working or feel bored (I've seen a lot of posts recently commenting on either or both topics) - I've got so many things I do outside of work that I enjoy and I've been able to spend so much more time with friends and family post-FIRE.

**Downshifting**

I have a much more laid back attitude with life. Before FIRE I was very much a ""always on the go"", Type A kind of person, feeling like I had to optimize every bit of every day, partially because I had limited time at home, but also because I wanted to ""maximize life"". While on a 3 week vacation, I actually had 1-2 days where I actually just lounged around at my hotel swimming pool instead of seeing cultural sights and exploring the city. If you bet me a year ago that I'd spend an entire day not doing anything besides laying at the pool and eating, I would have thought you were crazy. With the ability to do slower travel and therefore less pressure to squeeze everything in, I've found that FIRE has given me a a stronger sense of calm/relaxation from the normal frantic life and resulted in a lot less stress.

**Decisions and Structure**

From time to time, I found that there was a lot of things to do and it was often tiring to choose what to do. Making decisions takes energy and effort (see the book ""The Paradox of Choice"" for further information on choice and loss aversion). With a large lack of defined work schedule and structure, it was taking energy to make those decisions. What I've done to combat having to make so many decisions is to create a shell structure so I'm doing the things I want to avoid suffering from decision fatigue.

For example, Monday nights are always board game nights at my lcoal store, Monday and Thursday afternoon are my lead climbing days, Tuesdays are my puzzles or cheap movie nights, and Friday are my theater nights. Nothing is set in stone of course, but having the structure relieves me from having to make decisions all the time over things that I want to do and can let me spend more time on meaningful decisions.

# Budget in FIRE

I spent more on travel and some other areas, but surprisingly my spend was still only <$500 greater than my planned budget, despite paying for (effectively) Cobra Health Insurance for 6 months. The following are a few random musings of some areas where my budget has decreased as a result of FIRE:

**Lower expenses as a result of FIRE:**

* Saving on airfare by travelling on non-peak days/times.
* Taking advantage of $5 Tuesdays at AMC and other matinee movie prices.
* Lower food costs because I'm eating more at home more often.
* Lower transit costs because I've been riding my bike much more. Previously, I felt pressed for time so I would take the bus or train to places or Uber/Lyft, but now I get on my bike for more exercise and fresh air, while saving money.
* Will get about 2 months of ""free"" food (\~$1100 based on my budget) while volunteering at summer camp. Note: I'm doing the camp because I love it and it's not really ""free"" since I'm donating a lot of my time, but it just happens to be a side perk for volunteering.

# Goals for Year 2 of FIRE

* Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.
* Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).
* Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).
* Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor.  I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.

# Notable experiences since my last [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bqv9i4/100_days_on_loa_a_quantitative_view_of_my_time/):

* Ate at Blue Hill at Stone Barnes.
* Mountain biked for the first time, including some pretty difficult (for me) single track.
* Did a 5 pitch multi pitch route, leading 3 pitches (it was super soft). Climbed 2 different 6B+ routes (\~5.10D) on top rope without any takes. Those are the hardest grades I've ever climbed.
* Saw a 7 hour play, The Inheritance, which was absolutely incredible.
* Visited Thailand for 3 weeks, my 38th country.
* Saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!

# Notable planned events/trips for 2020

* Disneyworld and Universal Studios for a 10 days.
* Brazil trip for a month to travel/climb and to see my new niece (I'm a first time uncle!).
* Volunteer at two summer camps (including training, 68 days).
* Text/phone bank and canvas for swing states in September/October.
* Laos and Cambodia trip for 3 weeks to climb in Thakkek.

455,My cousin (32F) passed away yesterday due to car accident...... Balance between enjoy your life and FIRE,,1819,c7syyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c7syyh/my_cousin_32f_passed_away_yesterday_due_to_car/,1561989876.0,"Hi reddits. I am extremely sad rn. She is the one who introduced and incurred me to FIRE journey. Because of her I opened ROTH IRA account , started savings and learned the values of passive income. 

I’d say she wasnt “extremely” frugal but frugal enough to save decent.... This incident came to second guess myself and not too sure if ROTH IRA is still worth it when I never know if I’d be living till 59.5 years old.. 

I know YOLO isnt my thing.. but seeing her away like this at such a young age.. Would appreciate any advice that would help me revert to FIRE journey

Edit: Wow guys thank you so much for your responds. I am actually still debating contributing ROTH ira is worth it. In fact, my dad passed away when he was only 50. I’ll try to get my shit together. Or perhaps contribute less money to ROTH? Hmm",financialindependence

I'm 27, male, single, active duty (US), BS in  ME, 11&#37; to FI, above average health with no history of health problems. I've been on an FI track for the past year-and-a-bit with awesome results. ""Build the life... etc."" Plus it's fun; I enjoy the challenges of optimization and creative thinking. I didn't give up *that* much to achieve a high rate of savings. All the potential in the world, and not much concern for the future because, hey, I had a plan better than 90-whatever&#37; of the USA had.

At noon on a Thursday of March 2018, I felt like I might have a cold or the flu. I had felt great that morning.

The next day I started vomiting. It only got worse.

By Sunday I was hospitalized with fulminant liver failure, kidney failure, respiratory failure, pericarditis (inflammation of the sac around your heart, will collapse your heart), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, I barely knew who I was), and a couple other things I can't remember without checking my medical records. I didn't get a liver transplant because I wasn't expected to live. Somehow I did, and am on my road to recovery.

But more importantly, by the time I was hospitalized, I was barely able to communicate. I could not recognize or identify close friends or family. I did not have the chance or ability to make a will, discuss finances with my family, set up a college savings account for nieces, etc. I was vastly unprepared for the most unexpected circumstance.

It took one hell of a lesson to teach me to be prepared-- prepared beyond the ""save as much as possible"" mantra.

What are yall's thoughts? Things that seem obvious to you are not obvious-- or pressing-- to the rest of the FI community. Please share.

I haven't changed my savings plan much, but. For Garfield's sake. Stop and smell the roses. Twice.

Edit: Because this post became somewhat popular, I'd like to emphasize something I think most people already know: When things were bad, **at no point whatsoever did I think or care about money or work**. What I did think about:

\- How much I wanted to have one more hamburger

\- That girl I never asked to go on a date.

\- The embarrassing thing I said in class 12 years ago.

\- All the experiences I had planned for RE but couldn't do.

\- How silly my family/friend arguments were.

\- I could go on and on, but you get the picture.",financialindependence
457,Taking a mini-retirement changed my FIRE plans permanently,,1804,kcik2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kcik2p/taking_a_miniretirement_changed_my_fire_plans/,1607892831.0,"2 years ago, I was in a demanding well paid job (Sales Engineering) where despite the perks, pay and status I found myself often day dreaming about retiring to a tropical island and checking on my FIRE spread sheets to see how close I am. After a lot of soul searching, I decided to quit. Went on a mini retirement for a few months and switch to a much easier job I knew I could coast in at a 40% paycut. This is a follow up to [the original post I made at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96jo5r/your_fire_obsession_may_be_a_symptom_of_stress/).

&#x200B;

That was hands down the best decision I have made for my quality of life. My outlook of life and future has changed rather dramatically since then but here is a brief list of things I did and lessons I learned:

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Mini-retirement and switch to lower stress role completely changed my outlook of work. I went from wanting to FIRE ASAP to wanting to go back to work and stay there. The change has persisted for 2 years now. I now no longer see myself ever fully retiring. I should be FI in about 6 years but I don't see it changing much in my life.

&#x200B;

**Events**:

* Setting up 3 month mini retirement: After I quit my job and landed the new role, I realized I hadn't had more than a week off in my entire adult life. I decided it was foolish to plan the rest of my life to work for retirement but never even sample it. And man am I glad I did. I negotiated a delayed start date with my new manager. He had worked with me before and wanted me badly on the team so he agreed.
* First month off: During the first month off I did exactly the type of thing you'd expect someone released from the bondage of work to do. I flew across the country. Drove down the west cost all the way from Canada to San Diego and back, camped in national parks all the way through. Visited family and friends all over the country.
* Emulated retired living for 2 months: The next two months I intentionally tried not to treat my time off as a big vacation and use this time to learn how life would be after retirement. At first many of my days became really unproductive and overshadowed by a feeling of uselessness and slow decay. I usually have no trouble with motivation but I found myself struggling to do much more than play games all day in my PJs. This is when I learned that I have very different mindsets for when I want to get shit done and relax. In order to put myself in the right mindset I started to structure my days a little more. Wake up at a certain time and get a morning routine: shower, coffee, walk. Work on a few personal projects for a few hours to feel a sense of accomplishment. One thing that I started to miss a lot was the social contact at work. Seeing my friends frequently quickly became a very important part of my life during this time.
* New role (QA Engineer): My new role turned out to be exactly as relaxing as I had remembered. There is this implied social narrative that all jobs are equally challenging especially if they pay similarly. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one will openly admit they have an easy job. On top of the fact that very few people have had more than 1 serious career and thus have no accurate way of comparing to other positions. This is my third (did software development as well) and I can confirm that the level of overall stress and cost/benefit ratio between roles even in the same company can be drastically different.

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned**:

* FIRE (specifically RE) fantasies were nothing more than sophisticated tools of escapism. Once I eliminated the main sources of stress from my job, I automatically stopped living in the future. It is an unhealthy way of not living in the present and living life to the fullest.
* Work provides a lot more than money for most people. Much more than people give it credit for and most of it unappreciated. It's also a major source of structure, socialization, challenges, recognition, sense of accomplishment, identity and sense of purpose. In it's absence, you have to recreate a lot of these things on your own except often not as successfully and without the money or motivation.
* Socialization outside of work is really difficult. If you already have a well established social circle and do not plan to move, you might be fine. But if you are planning on meeting people, it will become exceedingly difficult to form strong bonds. Strong bonds often require suffering shared negative experiences together. School and work have a natural way of doing just that. Recreating that when the baser needs are satisfied is much harder than it seems.
* Never settling for a stressful position. The only regret I have is me trying to hang on to positions that were actively hurting my health and not appreciating the amazing life experiences that were passing me by. The money I traded those experiences and my limited time on earth for, has already lost much of its significance.

&#x200B;

By the end of the 3 months I was aching to get back to my work routine. HR messed up my start date in the new position by pushing it forward a week and I was disappointed enough in it that I asked the manager to get it fixed so I can start when I wanted.",financialindependence
458,"I think I figured out why many people react so negatively to the FIRE philosophy: It forces them to admit they could have done the same, but instead they're trapped by their own poor choices.",,1800,aoix0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/aoix0n/i_think_i_figured_out_why_many_people_react_so/,1549647387.0,"**edit2:**  Putting this at the top....since my point is being missed by a lot of commenters. I am saying that people that are **attacking** those that embrace a FIRE mind-set (WSJ, Forbes, Orman etc) are doing so to compensate for perceived short-comings in their own lives.   I am **not** saying that people who choose not to embrace it, who find it to not be their cup of tea, or who can't because of extenuating etc. are ""bad"". There's a huge difference between attacking a life-style and saying ""that's not for me / I can't go that path because of circumstance XYZ"", and I am referring to the former group, not the latter. I don't know how to make this any clearer.  

------
I used to be in the psychology field, and what I've found in life is that society takes on personal traits of the people in it because society is made up of those individual people.  That may seem obvious, but people miss that more often than you'd think.  

Right now in American society a vast majority of people are not at jobs they enjoy.  They're not saving enough for retirement.  Maybe they're stuck in a relationship with someone that's equally bad with money, and don't want to leave and lose half of what little they have.   Either way, their bad habits have them stuck where they are.  How does a person rationalize that?  You say ""That's just life.  Everyone's in this boat with me"".  You make water-cooler gossip about it, crack jokes, etc.   Deep down you're not happy, but you had no other options, right? 

What's the worst thing that can happen in that case?  You see a group of people that have budgeted well, that picked a career that pays well (instead of a career picking them), found partners that are not sabotaging their financial success, and are able to have a light at the end of a much shorter tunnel.  They have their independence, and the typical careless person does not.   

This lays bare the lies they told themselves, and they have to confront the fact that if not for poor choices, they would be in the same boat, and could have this life style for themselves as well.  Ironically, if instead of reacting so ""violently"" in opposition to FIRE they learned about it, they too could join us.   At the end of the day it's not FIRE they hate, it's their own lives, and that's why it's so hard to convince people to embrace this ideology we have.  They would have to admit how much they hate their current circumstances, and frankly most people would rather live in the dark and delude themselves.  

**edit:** Usually I hesitate to do this, but since a lot of people are apparently misinterpreting (maybe intentionally) my original post, let me clarify.  If you DON'T want to FIRE, fine, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  If you have extenuating circumstances, that prevent you from doing so, fine as well.  My original post is aimed at people who seem to be posting these articles about how awful FIRE is, or dangerous, or that criticize/demean people that embrace the FIRE mentality.  I'm not talking about someone who has a parent get sick, or gets hit by a bus.  My point is that their attitude comes from a place of denial & dissonance.  **Making a conscious choice to not FIRE is completely different from that, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it**.   I take a live-and-let-live approach and find it ironic that the comments below that are negative seem to completely miss my point and attack me directly, complaining that I'm somehow demeaning them.   

edit2: OK, one more time. I don't think this is particularly hard to get, but since it's being missed by a lot of commenters.  I am saying that people that are **attacking** those that embrace a FIRE mind-set (WSJ, Forbes, etc) are doing so out of bitterness over their own lives.  I am **not** saying that people who **choose** not to embrace it, who find it to not be their cup of tea, or who can't because of extenuating etc. are ""bad"".  There's a huge difference between attacking a life-style and saying ""that's not for me / I can't go that path because of circumstance XYZ"", and I am referring to the former group, not the latter.

459,update: eight months into early retirement,,1799,7uj4zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7uj4zu/update_eight_months_into_early_retirement/,1517495927.0,"**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing monthly early-retirement series that will continue indefinitely, provided that the voting reflects the view that it is still seen as relevant to the community. I suppose that this is my way of giving back to a movement that helped me tremendously on my journey. As this post has become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend a great deal of the first day of every month on reddit has significantly waned, **my responses will be limited**. Career and background summaries are provided at the end and repeated every month. Please check those sections as well as the comments and posts from previous months to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all the thanks and well-wishers, even if I don’t take the time to say so individually.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. I will use a maximum withdrawal rate of 3% of the year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 ($2618 adjusted for inflation). Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month ($30k per year) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not how the holy Trinity works, but consider these three factors: a 3% goal withdrawal rate is below the 100% historically safe mark for indefinite portfolio survival, our actual withdrawal rate is just above 2% of the original portfolio balance thus far due to earning additional income, and the extended bull market has put us 15% above our original target amount. We obviously have some flexibility.

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month came to $2238. This is $535 under the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 8.1% under budget for the month, now 8.1% under for the year. We generated $1491 of income this month from my wife's part-time fun job at the library, sales on ebay, and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $747 this month, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate is 0.81% for the month, 0.81% for the year, and 2.19% since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 2.42% for the month, 2.42% for the year, and 3.44% since retirement.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,109,284 to $1,156,382 (a 4.25% increase for the month), which dropped down to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,155,635 after paying the bills. This is a 12.7% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals of $14,739 for living expenses over eight months. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $104.28/hr of labor income. VTSAX (62% AA) went up 5.3% this month (5.3% up for the year); VFWAX (21% AA) went up 5.7% (5.7% up for the year); VWLUX (17% AA) went down 1.6% (down 1.6% for the year).

**Reflections**: Our previous best month for the portfolio was 11/2017 with a 1.99% return. 1/2018 shattered that mark with a 4.25% return (and was actually well above 6% before this week’s correction). We made more money in the first three weeks of January than I ever made in any six-month period as a pharmacist. I have come to accept that the market is in insanely frothy territory, but I will sail obliviously forward with it. I am very thankful that, two years ago, I took the consensus view here of asset allocation and moved from 50/50 stocks/bonds to 80/20. Spending has returned to normal since the lump sum expenses that tend to cluster in December are now behind us. We had no big purchases this month for me to make excuses around, which is a first since retirement. There were just some small things like two unwanted family dinners, amazon prime renewal, and two large electric bills.

**Experiences**: I strained the flexor hallucis brevis in my right foot on 1/4, which caused me to miss over two weeks of marathon training. Who knew such a thing existed? I wasted a lot of time on the computer the first few days after that doing nothing productive. I also came to terms with the fact that I am isolated. My friends have work, school, and children to occupy their time. I have none of those. I have nothing but time. I have no desire to join social groups and meet new people just for the sake of meeting new people because I honestly do not care for most people. My wife is on the other end of ninety-nine percent of my conversations. I did not anticipate what this would feel like. I am not fishing for advice or sympathy; I am just writing what is on my mind. While down with injury, I spent seventy hours creating an astronomy timeline display for the museum where I volunteer. Instead of learning about how the universe formed, it focuses on the order in which we learned about certain aspects of the universe and updates our understandings as you move forward through time. We started Game of Thrones (in season four now). I started running again on 1/22 and began playing the Nintendo Gamecube games that I purchased over a decade ago and never touched. I also made a gratitude list recently. It is ridiculously long. Reading it makes me feel ashamed when I find myself worrying over trivial matters. I think this is a good exercise for everyone to do. Finally, I did my taxes yesterday, which will get a special section this month…

**Taxes**: I anticipated breaking even, but I will be getting an unexpected refund of $5000. This is a breakdown of what happened. First, there is some absurd thing called a Retirement Savings Contributors Credit of $2000 to help low-income people such as myself save for retirement (which I clearly could not do on my own without this much-needed help). Second, I forgot that my income would be low enough this year to recharacterize my $5500 IRA contribution from Traditional to Roth. Third, I forgot that I had $3000 in capital gains losses from bond sales that carried over from the previous year. Fourth, I spent some time converting a hobby over to a business last year, which I figured would be a smart move since I’ll have more time on my hands (many of the startup costs can be immediately deducted). Fifth, there is a cap on how much of the excess premium tax credit one has to return on ACA subsidy payments. I anticipated having to pay a lot more back because I made the mistake of getting the most expensive plan that the subsidies would cover fully at 100% FPL. If I had it to do again, I would have chosen a cheaper plan since there was no way I could have got our MAGI down to 100% FPL with five months of employment. In short, we ended up paying less than $100 in taxes despite earning over $73,000. How to eliminate $73k in income: $18k 401(k) contribution, $3k business startup, $3k capital loss carryover, $11k IRA contributions, $2k student loan interest, $13k standard deduction, and $8k exemptions leave $15k in taxable income (and $1k owed in taxes). $1k taxes + $1.5k ACA excess payment negated almost entirely by $2k Retirement Savings Contributors Credit and $400 in foreign tax credit. Net taxes: less than $100.

**Upcoming**: On February 3, I will be going for 1:25-1:28 in my half marathon. No real goal, but a top ten finish (out of 500-600) would be nice. I finished 98th when I pulled myself off of the couch in 2013. My personal record of 1:27:57 should fall easily unless something goes wrong. After the race, more Gamecube, more Game of Thrones, and more running. I will continue volunteering at the museum, and I have plans to volunteer in the campaign for a local House race. She doesn’t have a prayer of winning, but that’s not the point. I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors and doctorate before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years, entirely with CVS. $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70%.

**Background**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

Last month has been the most expensive month in my 15yr working life. In June, a lot happened:

-I started visiting a cardiologist because of strange chest pain. Had multiple expensive tests done ($1500).

-I visited the ER after a bout of extreme chest pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy ($1000). First ER visit ever for me in 20+ years actually. Just glad it wasn't cardiac.

-We repaired a foundation watering system for our house (this is absolutely essential where we live) ($500)

-And the wife got one time surgery for Sinusitis ($5000)

-And the wife replaced some durable medical equipment she needs to replace every 4-5 years ($1000)

-And then I had the first accident in my life in the same month. I totaled my car and bought another used one for cash ($7000).

Under ordinary circumstances, a family with our middle class income would be under an incredible amount of financial stress and strain.

But we aren't having trouble at all, at least financially. We haven't even had to worry about money in the slightest because we're savers. I think this is one of the largest benefits of FIRE or at least a saving mentality in general.",financialindependence

The blue line is my cumulative 401k contributions.  

The red line is 401k contributions made by my employers, most entirely as company matches, but also with 2 safe harbor bonuses (the small spikes in the chart) paid entirely as a 401k bonus; this line is basically free money since the match is a benefit in addition to my salary.  

The green line is the blue line plus the red line.  

The purple line is my 401k account balance.  

The difference between the purple line and the green line is investment gains. There was a brief period in 2008/2009 where I lost money due to the ‘08 market crash, but it was followed by solid gains for the last 10 years due to the 10-year bull market that’s been happening.

This is a follow up post to my [last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bjghrb/from_10k_to_500k_in_6_years_with_graph/). A few different things have happened in life and I figured I'd give y'all an update. This is my wife and I's journey from poor recent college grads to financially stable adults! This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on Nov 30th 2019. It's really cool to begin to see the exponential growth and how fast my investment returns are beginning to outpace my salary.

Since the last updated I've:

* Sold my Amazon Affiliates website for \~70k
* Had a kid (almost 4 months old already!)
* Fully moved into my new house and did all my preliminary big tasks like putting in a bigger patio, stonework, etc.
* About to start a new job

Some answers to common questions are below:

*  This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 28 years old, live in Houston, TX and had our first kid 4 months ago. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference I currently have around 155k in equity in my home and owe 184k (total value of house is \~340k) . I have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. I do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good.
* I keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when I bought my first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and I bought my next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we also still have.
* My taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* I have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Both my and my wife's vehicles are fully paid off and we plan to run them into the dirt (even is she thinks otherwise!)
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -> 74K promotion ->97k current job -> 110k new job I should start Jan 2nd or so)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -> 84k promotion -> 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-> max IRA's -> invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -> pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",financialindependence
464,At age 38 my dad had no savings and started a family. He retired at age 60. Hoping this inspires some of the older FIRE candidates out there that it's possible.,,1771,82uc2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/82uc2v/at_age_38_my_dad_had_no_savings_and_started_a/,1520478439.0,"There are a lot of posts on here about young 25-35 year olds with bank accounts which would lose them friends, and this leaves the people who are getting to the game later in life disheartened.

For those of you who are starting your FIRE journey at 40, I have a success story to share with you. It’s not pulling yourself up by your bootstraps or making $200k/year, it’s simply getting in the mindset, getting in the groove of saving and working towards a goal.
My parents never called their financial goals FIRE, but they did exactly what we’re all here for without the name. The kicker and point of this story is that my father didn’t start his career until he was 38 years old.

* 1977: At 21 my dad got married and was barely scraping by his biology classes at a small east coast school.

* 1983: his relationship was a mess. He had jobs ranging from working in a leather tannery, to working in a lab, but he needed a change. He divorced and moved to Michigan to follow his passion of being a professional photographer.

* 1990: working at a retail photography store and shooting weddings on the weekends didn’t allow him to have a family and was not going to allow him to retire at any age. He applied to the local state school for a grad degree.

* 1993: He was now 38. He had no savings, just a car and a masters in industrial health and hygiene. He got remarried to my mom and I was born 9 months later. Starting this family really set him into overdrive; he wanted to retire at a normal age, but he was starting from square one.

He found that the most lucrative thing in his field (environmental) wasn’t the science but the business side. He walked into consulting firms and told them they needed a dedicated sales person for their office. One office took him on and offered him a six month trial period to see how he did. They didn’t pay him much but it was a foot in the door. After those first six months they offered him a full time position.

He continued in the field for the next 25 years, building a client base which he would take with him if he changed jobs. The problem is he was pure overhead at these companies, and there’s not much room at environmental companies for overhead. He got cut from jobs probably every five years on average, so it was high stress, but it was better money than even the engineers at the companies made.

His hobby of classic cars also doubled as his side-gig, and he sold car parts on eBay for fun.

A necessary note to add here is my mom was a SAHM until the early 2000s when she started her own business which did fairly well at providing additional income.

**He retired at 60 in 2016, 22 years after starting his career.** He put three kids through college. His income by the end was $110k-$130k.

He has told me how jealous he is that I got a real financial education and I started saving 20 years before he did – a sentiment I’ve seen on here as well. His statement on money which has stuck with me is: **“It’s not about how much you make, it’s about how much you keep.”**

Being diligent about spending money on needs and experiences rather than things allowed a 40 year old to retire in 20 years. Use all the financial tools available to you and never for one second believe that you started too late and you’ll never retire.

465,"Life and Death, a perspective.",,1766,hbnyfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hbnyfi/life_and_death_a_perspective/,1592517474.0,"  

I shared a piece of my story a few days ago and despite it receiving a large number of positive votes and comments, the powers deemed it inappropriate. So allow me to try again and this time I will be much more direct in my thoughts.

Several years ago, just as the ‘08/’09 crisis was irrupting I greatly expanded my business as a final push towards my own FIRE goals even though I had never heard of the FIRE movement. The brass ring was inches from my fingers when my industry was utterly destroyed upon the shoals of that disaster. Even though I didn’t fulfill my goals, I got close enough to enjoy some of the fruits of my labors and I stopped working 80 hours a week. My life’s story has been one of never quite making it, but being happy with the outcome nevertheless.

Now for the rest of the story…

Quite a few years ago I knew the scale had tipped. My yesterdays outnumbered my tomorrows. You can look at actuary tables, family histories and still you only have a guess at best. On May 27th I found out how far my guess was from reality. I knew something was wrong with my heart and asked my wife to drive me to the ER. Attempts at installing stints failed and I was scheduled for immediate open heart surgery. My surgeon explained to me that with disease this progressed you usually never find out about … but your family will. I survived and am on the mend but I am facing a very long and difficult road which is unlikely to lead back to my old work life. (Thank God for small favors!)

The Stoics talk about living life as if you are about to die, which is what I used to think I did. That is until I faced the very real possibility of not surviving the surgery (which I almost didn’t). I am unsure as to what changes, large and small, I will make in my life and perspective. I am not making any even slightly major decisions for at least another 3 months.

My thoughts for this group is simply to take my experience as a cautionary tale. My life nearly ended shortly after my 58th birthday. I almost became one of those “it is a shame he died so young.” You do not know the extent of your tomorrows, but you do have today. Cherish your loved ones, call your parents today, hug your spouse, and be a friend to someone who needs it. These are far more important than anything else because tomorrow you may not have. 

Pursue FIRE, for it is a worthy objective, but never forget to keep things in balance and be sure to have lived today.",financialindependence

This isn’t a post that I’m trying to complain or whine. I’m content with the realization that I won’t realistically retire much before I’m 65. With that in mind, I’m going to be making a major change to my life. 

Current info:

Married, single income with 5 kids

Gross pay 65k, living frugally to save about 15%. Employer provided health insurance with a $2k out of pocket max

However, I live 87 miles from work and have been driving that trip for far too long. This commute is costing me nearly $9,000 and 750 hours per year. 

I also work the afternoon shift and don’t get home from work until nearly 2am. Getting up at 7am is rough. 

So time for a change. 

My mother in law owns a business that she is ready to reduce the amount of time that she is working and has offered me a job running the store Monday - Friday during regular hours. She is working on figuring out health insurance and has always helped us out in the past. We will have to move across the state, but being less than 10 miles from work is now a very real possibility, making the pay cut much easier to handle. 

This isn’t really the epitome of independence, but I’m tired of being tired and burning through cars. Driving 3 hours a Day is insanely wearing. 

Anyways, thanks for reading and I’m happy to answer any questions/criticism. 

TL;DR - taking a 24% pay cut to drop a 188 mile daily round trip commute so I can enjoy my wife and 5 kids instead of just getting through each day like a zombie. 


Edit. Thanks for the (mostly) positive comments. To me, my family is the priority and having the chance to have my own business and be home with my children is the goal. 

The likelihood of Lowe’s/HD moving in and pushing out the business is very low. I’m familiar with the area and the closest “big city” is Marquette, MI

There are other opportunities for supplemental income. 

I’m done selling my life to an employer, I want to be with my family.

468,How many of you concentrate on earning more instead of extreme frugality?,,1757,ewx36a,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ewx36a/how_many_of_you_concentrate_on_earning_more/,1580513563.0,"I can't help but feel that earning more through educated investment, side-gigs, better career choices is a more solid way to get to FIRE rather than double down on extreme frugality.

Picking a good mutual fund/etf is more important than not cutting my own hair or trying to grow my own vegetables.

&#x200B;

Clearly, I'm not saying it's either one or the other, but I feel like ""making more"" is often less talked about in FIRE. Instead, there is a much bigger emphasis on spending less. I'm relatively frugal, but I think keeping a healthy balance that is right for me impacts my quality of life greatly. Being able to do something nice for my kid (take him for an ice-cream, buy him a new lego set, etc) is just as important as turning off lights when not used, doing laundry less often, buying used clothes, etc.

&#x200B;

For me picking the right things in investments, selling things instead of throwing/giving them away, buying used (when appropriate), trying to earn more in my work are all big in my daily routine.

One thing I can't see giving up is my Jiu-jitsu gym membership (a sport  that requires partners and where coach is essential for learning and improvement).  Keeps me fit and happy (for some strange reason ""sport tired""= good vibes vs ""work tired"" = bad vibes.)

&#x200B;

What do you to earn more?

My list:

\- more educated investments

\- selling instead of throwing things away

\- trying to advance career instead of being in one place

\- searching for gigs to do

\- searching for items to re-sell (cars, electronics, etc)

One of the things they knew of the killer was that he must be “Independently Wealthy”.

Independently Wealthy.

For the rest of the movie I couldn’t stop thinking about that term. To have enough money to do… whatever you want all day. To have enough money you didn’t have to work. To have freedom.

That was a turning point in my thinking and knowing I had a goal to achieve. My decisions since then have been influenced by that idea, with the goal of being “Independently Wealthy”. 23 years later I still remember sitting in that theatre and rolling it over and over in my head for the rest of the show, and really my entire life since then.

Quote from him:  “The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.” 

In ""retirement"", some people asked him what to do with their money, and he ended up starting a partnership to help manage money... the rest is history!

474,I.....think we somehow hit our number much earlier than expected. Kind of in shock. I’m usually pretty adaptable but this is a big deal- with nobody to tell. So here is the new bar for the record. And my motivation.,,1756,hp6h8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hp6h8i/ithink_we_somehow_hit_our_number_much_earlier/,1594455325.0,"41 and 35 couple. LCOL area. Spend without really economizing much is 60k. Tracked via mint the last 10 months.  This includes a luxurious (IMO) 15k vacation budget. 

Taxes are due so I’ve been looking at the numbers. We make significant money and invest a lot in real estate. It makes the numbers a little murky day to day. Lots of pass through money. 

I’m not a weekly or monthly spreadsheet tracker. I’m not even particularly organized. I mostly operate by rough estimates, gut feelings and spot checks. I probably don’t fit in here. 

We are refinancing a chunk of our rental portfolio and the values have gone up according to fresh appraisals. A lot. We applied significant leverage at a good time and won the housing market timing lotto. We doubled down multiple times and did very well.  

The portfolio equity + retirement accounts + cash is now conservatively 1.5 million. The 4% rule says we could sell and coast on index funds. But transaction costs and capital gains  would probably net us 1.1, so not quite. 

Then we analyzed cash flow. I haven’t used my paycheck for living expenses in 18 months.   This is a good sign. After a round  of refinancing the rentals will cash flow roughly 4000 a month.  My rockstar real estate agent partner could sell the 3 houses a year to cover the gap in her sleep. She currently sells 30+. 

But...I have a lot of excuses. I like my job,mostly. I kinda want more than the minimum. It will take some time to exit gracefully. I’m scared. I still have youngish kids. 
So tonight we set a new bar. I’m writing it down so it doesn’t creep too much. 

OLD BAR:
17 units. $200 cash flow per unit. 1 million net worth. Work to 55 for pension. Annual income at retirement about 60k, rising rapidly as units are paid off, reaching 150k at 70. 

NEW BAR:
5000 a month cash flow from rentals verified by 9 months of clean book keeping. 
2 units paid off. (This should boost cash flow a fair amount) 

2 years expenses in cash

1.5 million net worth after transaction costs etc. call it 1.9 in all portfolios. 

Finish renovations on our house and new roofs on 10 units. 

Expected time frame:  1.5 years if the market cooperates. 


Motivation: watching my grandparents fade away and seeing their best years are gone. At age 85 they live happily on 25k because they mostly watch TV and tend their lawn. Having 100k annually doesn’t make strokes less grim or restore grandma’s mind.  It can’t ease the pain in joints or restore strength and balance. 

It is probably better to go do things I want now and spend time with my kids while I can and not pad the accounts too much more.

Wish us luck the next 18 months.",financialindependence

For some background, I've been a regular reader of /r/financialindependence since I was a Junior in high school.  Originally, I was just curious about finances and the stock market in general, but over time began to realize that the idea of becoming financially independent appealed to me.  Thus, I resolved to devote myself wholeheartedly to that end once I got a job.  That ended up being pretty quick, as I decided later that year to enlist in the Air Force for personal reasons.  After graduating High School, I quickly left for basic training, and from there began to put into practice what I had learned.  

There were some rough patches here and there, but a little over two years later I hit my very first personal milestone:  [$50,000 in net worth.]( https://imgur.com/7iKNBIf) On top of that, I have a fairly nice car, a great credit score, and, thanks to my military benefits, my future college degree all but paid for.  It might seem cliché to say it was all thanks to a forum on the internet, but honestly, it’s the truth.  Without r/FI, I never would’ve known to save any of my money (much less >50%), wouldn’t have known to start building my credit early on, would’ve likely bought a car I could barely afford with an outrageous interest rate loan, and probably wouldn’t have realized anything was wrong until reality slapped me in the face 10 years down the line.  I can say all that with relative certainty because I’ve been watching many of my peers make those exact mistakes over these past two years, blowing every paycheck down to the last penny.  

I realize I’m still young, and have a long way to go, both in life and in my journey to FI, but I just wanted to thank all of you here who contribute your thoughts, research, and experience to this subreddit.

It’s not really an indicator of what the average person’s life is and therefore creates a lot of sadness and depression for people who use that platform too much and start to compare their real life to someone else’s sizzle reel. 

Sometimes I do that with this sub. 

This sub can become a sizzle reel to me. The reason being is I imagine that 90% of the sub are people like me. Salaries between 30-90k who are saving aggressively in order to go against societal norms of what wealth and/or retirement should be. 

(when I was in HS I really like that Rage Against the Machine song  “F*ck You I wont Do What You Tell Me!” and I realize that FIRE is just a grown up version of that... but back to my point)

The other 10% are people in STEM or unique situations who share what they’ve got going on. 

I’d venture a guess that 80% or the content comes from those 10% of users in this sub. 

So the status quo, or what is average, is set by that 10%. 

“37 - 2.5M NW what should I do?” type posts. 

Now I’m not saying the person writing this is bragging or doing it for validation (although I’m sure that’s true in some situations). 

But it does set the bar in many ways... well shit I’m no where close to that I’ll never share where I’m at, now that I think of it I’m kind of a failure. 

That’s why mindfulness is so important with FI if you’re going in these groups. I lose track of that sometimes and just pile on myself but really I should just be comparing me against myself yesterday and not against redditors. 

TL:DL The high achievers tend to share disproportionately more which creates an unrealistic average which in turn creates lurkers out of most people in the sub who are left thinking they haven’t done squat.

480,How my wife saved me (financially as well as other tings),,1709,k9h5l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k9h5l3/how_my_wife_saved_me_financially_as_well_as_other/,1607474699.0,"First let me say I am making this post in response to the amazing and overwhelming comments I received as a result of my comment on another post. You guys are all amazing. I waited until my wife was home and she's here with my as I type making sure I don't miss anything and also to fact check when I exaggerate as I have a tendency to do.

TL;DR: I was a middle-class suburban bum who didn't know anything about money and my wife came from nothing and her work ethic and ability to organize money led me to pay off my student loans last week

Now to get an idea of both myself and my wife I'll give you a little background. I came from a typical Middle Class, suburban American family. My mom is a nurse and my dad has done everything from own a chair factory to delivering dental supplies, but we always were pretty well off. This is also partly due to my father's family being very wealthy and allowing him to inherit the money to buy his home with zero mortgage. Financially, I was taught little or nothing growing up, everyone is aware of the lack of financial prep in the US school system, and my family treated money as a sort of ""dirty"" topic. If you did something for free you were ""clean"" and ""noble"" if you did things outright for the pay it was ""mercenary"" and not considered good. When I was told to look for careers both me and my siblings weren't told ""make sure you can make a living and take care of yourselves"" but ""do what you love, the money doesn't matter"" and the classic ""money doesn't bring happiness"". It took me years to learn that a lack of money can certainly bring UNhappiness.

So, as a result, I found myself making a series of financial mistakes my whole life. Everything from not opening a line of credit (I thought I was ""beating the dirty bankers"") to develop my credit score, to repeatedly overdrawing my checking account to be hit with $500 overage fees AND additional $25 late on paying the overage fees-fees (Once I owed up to $2000 without realizing and only by pleading with both the bank to reduce it to $1000 and my mom to pay it off did I escape that fiasco). And I never really learned. After moving out of the house I did get used to checking my checking account to make sure I had enough money to pay various bills and rent, though I do remember forgetting a few times and having my water shut off. Long story short I found myself an adult with no career, $80,000+ in student loan debt, and zero idea of how to progress.

Now my wife's story is about as opposite as you can get. She was born in Thailand. Her mother was from an extremely poor farming family who sometimes had one bowl of rice to share for the whole family for the day. Her dad was a little better off with a more middle class family and worked as an electrician of sorts. My wife's mother was his second marriage after he drove the first wife off and it was an arranged marriage that my wife's mother did not was to do. She has an older half sister from her father's first marriage (who is a mess) and her father did NOT want another girl, he wanted a boy. In fact her nickname to this day is ""Bee"" stemming from her being ""Plan B"" or ""If it's a boy, his name is A, if it's a girl she's B"".

That theme sort of continued while she was young. Her sister was given as much as the family could support, being the oldest, and had all the normal things like schools supplies and even had her university studies paid for by their father (she dropped out). My wife on the other hand had to make due with hand me down clothes that her mom would sew deep hems in the skirts to fit her body which she would eventually let out bit by bit as she grew. When she wanted to go to school her father told her she had to find the money herself because the family couldn't afford it.

Thankfully, her mom (basically to keep her occupied while her mom was at work) had signed her up for every athletics program under the sun from a very young age and thanks to both good academic grades and a talent for basketball she not only achieved scholarships to a college prep school but to one of the most prestigious universities in the country. She just told me to make sure that I mention how her mom had her keep a record of her spending and saving on a piece of paper ever since she got a small allowance as a little girl and learn how to cut out ""unnecessary things"" (her favorite mantra that I picked up).

While at University my wife had to struggle in the extreme as not only did her family not help with tuition, but food, housing, books, clothes, or anything else was up to her. She had to find a way to make enough money to live and study while competing both for the schools basketball and, occasionally, the schools Judo team, which any student athlete can tell you is already a full time job.

It was hard, very hard. ""The lowest point of my life"" she says. She made money by doing freelance work as a graphics designer (she majored in Animation and Graphic Design, she always wanted to learn to paint but decided she'd never make money doing that, to this day she's an amazing sketch artist and painter btw). She went for years subsiding on about $40 a month. She couldn't even afford rice to eat and had to buy bulk packs of ramen noodles which she supplemented with discount vegetables to literally not get scurvy. This whole time she watched as her family descended into chaos as her grandfather (on her dad's side) passed away and his children, her aunts and uncles fought like hyenas over an elephants carcass over the inheritance and her sister ended up stealing from her father large sums of money, ran off, got pregnant, abandoned her children and came back to continue a sad decline into drugs and bad life choices.

She graduated eventually and tried to make a living as a graphic artist in Thailand, but her dad had lost his job due to a declining mental state caused by PTSD from several brushes with Thailand's underworld while he was an electrical building inspector. So now, she had to support her father (and as a result her sister) on her own. After two years of trying in Thailand she realized she wouldn't be able to and ended up decided to leave Thailand and become and au pair to support her family. I'd like to add that through my wife I've met a lot of au pairs and their lot is utter garbage and little better than slavery in many situations and while many come from decent backgrounds just trying to make some money while they explore the wider world, most are desperate and trying to find a way to escape the poverty of their homes like my wife.

I met my wife in America. I was working as a fat, more than broke delivery driver and she was a struggling au pair working basically 24/7 (I know it's technically not, but when you live in the home you work it does it really matter if you're on the clock if the baby wakes up crying?) and making $195 a week. She sent back $350 a month to support her family and saved the rest as best she could. I had no idea how much I made or where it went aside from I hadn't had an overcharge fee in a little while.

Eventually after meeting, falling in love, and deciding to get married she eventually quit being an au pair and moved in with my and my family (after I moved back to America I moved in with my parents where I still live today) and the journey of first discovering my financial mess and fixing it began, and oh boy, what I write can only scratch the edge of the weekly ""checkups"" and arguments and lectures and stress that went into this development, it wasn't easy for either of us. She couldn't believe she'd become partners with such a disorganized mess and for me it proved to be VERY hard to learn to curb your spending when you never thought to before.

Luckily, I had ""graduated"" from being a delivery driver to working at Solar City. The first step on a long journey that eventually led to me joining the Ironworkers Union. On my development my wife showed me how to keep a physical record of every single penny I spent and earned. I would keep it up for a week, forget and loose the book then she would buy me another one and we began again. I have a closet full of about a dozen checking account books. Then she had me organize my student loans. I had no idea how much my monthly minimums were and was shocked to find out it was almost $700/mo. She taught me what interest was. These were the first steps.

I struggled, I mean really struggled to get the basic concepts of knowing where my money was at all times. Old me thought that was a waste of brain energy and it was a hard mentality to break. I'd say at least a year went by before I really understood how much I made each week/month and what my monthly expenditures were and by then I'd taken my second step in my career as a laborer working for a commercial solar company. Now I was making enough money to start paying off my loans consistently on my own (my mom had been paying part each month) even with my sloppy book keeping. This was the second biggest motivator in my life to get my sh\*t together, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that, yes I in fact could climb out of my hole myself. This and the other motivation led me to working as much overtime as possible and picking up a second job as a pizza delivery guy Friday-Sunday. I was not working more than I thought was possible (depending on overtime opportunities between 65-85 hours a week).

The main motivation though, was seeing my wife's growth no matter how many hours I worked she always ALWAYS worked more it was inspiring, exhaustin and terrifying at times to see. In my previous comment I said she'd nearly doubled her income a year, and I wasn't joking. After she left being an au pair she had to wait 6 grueling months to get her green card. It nearly drove her insane and she ended up working under the table as a cleaning lady to continue to support her family. She'd clean everything from ritsy homes in Cambdrige and Brookline to the utterly disgusting college kid housing around BC/BU/Harvard areas. She kept a paper record this whole time and is checking it now to see how much she made she made a little over $1000/month.

After she was cleared for work she continued as a cleaning lady but also got a job as a cashier, eventually a waitress at a local Vietnamese restaurant. She stopped being an au pair in January, in June she was making $1000/mo, July $1800, August $2100, September $2700, October $3000. She just read those off (I'm rounding to the nearest $100). A year later she'd left the cleaning job and started working as a waitress at a second restaurant as well as picking up shifts at David's Bridal as a seamstress, eventually maxing out at $4500/mo. In March 2018 she made $5200. This is just from pure willpower and work ethic. After going over the numbers this is where she maxes out for the present but even if it's not doubled (sorry my own exaggeration) since then this, to me, is an outstanding growth.

So watching her fight like that how could I not? I worked my bun off right next to her. She taught me to push like I never pushed before and now that I was putting in that many hours and that much effort I finally not only had the knowledge how to track my money but I had a deep desire to know where every drop of sweat was being saved or spent. I got better at accounting using Mint and my bank's online manager. I followed my 401k growth, I checked how much I was spending on gas, on work clothes, I didn't write it down like she did but I learned to keep track of everything. Nothing motivates someone knowing how much they have like knowing how hard it is to earn.

Eventually I got into the Union after years in construction. With my wife's work ethic driving my I'd garnered a reputation as a motivated and dedicated hand wherever I went. I might not be the best, but you can bet I'd be the first there and the last to leave, very few people out worked me. This reputation eventually got me noticed by a Union member and thanks to years of trying to keep up with my wife I'd grown into a much better person and while it can be very difficult to get into a Union it took one week from my first meeting to being on a jobsite with a Union outfit, riding an elevator up the biggest building I'd ever worked on (50ish stories) and up to a career that could support my own family the rest of my life. All thanks to my wife. After that I'd graduated the whole ""watch your money"" phase she taught me more, and we learned together. I started paying off my loans early in a focused way, starting with the highest interest first. I opened credit cards and used them both sparingly and paid them off each week to keep my balance low and my credit score high. I started investing in basic stocks to get a feel for the market, putting about 10% of my paycheck in as a learning cost and two years after getting into the ironworkers union I FINALLY paid off the last of my student debt. From $80,000+ to $0 all thanks to my wife's guidance and teachings.

Sorry this is an aside but it's actually funny, compared to any American construction worker I was a hungry tiger who devoured work, and it actually meant I ended up being classified less as ""one of the Americans"" but was adopted by the other class of hungry-tiger-worker in my industry: the other immigrants. Construction in any state in the US is done by Spanish immigrants, not completely but they are a constant and huge presence on any jobsite. Most I've met work like my wife. Voraciously. They came from harder lives than most can understand (An Elsalvadorian friend of mine, and the best carpenter I've ever seen, tell me how when he was 12 a guerrila army told him he was to fight with them or they'd kill his mom so he did that until a helicopter gunship killed them all so he ran and got a job loading boulders onto trucks). My motto since then has been ""Work like an immigrant, get paid like a citizen"". That last part is unfortunately since many are illegal they get taken hugely advantage of with no options.

To finish this insanely long tale: After I got in the Union my wife saw how the Union allowed minorities and women a chance to work in the trades and the benefits both in take home pay, and in benefits (Insurance, annuity, pension, vacation pay, free training) and decided she wanted to make the move, too. Ever since she was little she wanted to be like her dad, an electrician, but he told her girls couldn't do it. Now, when the opportunity presented itself she gave it her all, like she always does, and less than a year later she is the top student in her 1st year technician apprentice class and had multiple supers and foremen tell her she'll be a foreman soon, which I never doubted.

481,seven months after early retirement,,1711,7n1p1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7n1p1i/seven_months_after_early_retirement/,1514642747.0,"**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing monthly early-retirement series that will continue indefinitely, provided that the voting reflects the view that it is still seen as relevant to the community. I suppose that this is my way of giving back to a movement that helped me tremendously on my journey. As this post has become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend a great deal of the first day of every month on reddit has significantly waned, **my responses will be very limited going forward**. Career and background summaries are provided at the end and repeated every month. Please check there to find answers to potential questions.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. I will use a maximum withdrawal rate of 3% of the year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. This amount is $2564 per month for 2017, based on the June 2017 starting balance of $1,025,772. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $30k/yr guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not how the holy Trinity works, but since 3% is well within historically safe territory for indefinite portfolio survival, and since our withdrawal rate has actually averaged below 2.5% of the original portfolio balance thus far due to earning additional income, we have some flexibility.

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month came to $3618. This is $1054 over the 2017 monthly targeted amount of $2564. Our spending was 41.1% over budget for the month, now 19.7% over for the year. We generated $1227 of income this month from my wife's part-time fun job at the library and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $2665 this month, thus our pro-rated annual withdrawal rate is 3.12% for the month and 2.19% for the year. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated annual withdrawal rate would have been 4.07% for the month and 3.59% for the year.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,098,383 to $1,111,949 (a 1.24% increase for the month), which dropped down to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,109,284 after paying the bills. This is an 8.1% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals of $13,992 for living expenses over seven months. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $80.36/hr of labor income. VTSAX (61% AA) went up 0.7% this month (19.0% for the year); VFWAX (21% AA) went up 1.4% (23.7% for the year); VWLUX (18% AA) did what it was supposed to do.

**Reflections**: Our investments are once again at an all-time high, primarily due to passage of the tax cut for wealthy job creators like myself. /s Spending continued to be over budget in December due to the $1100 property tax, $400 six-month car insurance premium, and $200 payment for trees. This should settle back down next month. The increase in the new year-end balance from $1,025,772 to $1,109,284 means our spending budget will increase from $2564 to $2773 in 2018. I’m gonna get some extra cheese on my Whopper!

**Experiences**: I broke the three-hour barrier in the marathon by going 2:58:18 on 34 miles per week of running during the training cycle. I consider this to be my greatest personal accomplishment since retirement, especially considering the healthy amount of skepticism shared by the running community on being able to do so with less than 50 miles per week. I finally played all of the PS1 games that I purchased nearly a decade ago, including Chrono Cross, Dragon Warrior VII, Xenogears, and Final Fantasy V. I’m still volunteering at the natural history museum. I’ve watched a few of the new movies that are expected to compete for awards this season. I planted a lot of trees and picked up a lot of litter. I made a fairly detailed map of our property. Looking back at this partial year, it’s hard for me to comprehend how much time I’ve spent housekeeping, cooking, weightlifting, running, swimming, volunteering, writing, exploring, building, gaming, reading, studying, internetting, mapping, napping, planting, listening to music, watching movies, picking up litter, and visiting family. My life expectancy is fifty more years, but I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime in just these past seven months. I would not return to retail pharmacy for triple the salary. I do not know what real stress is. I do not know what alarm clocks are. My life is so much better than it was before. I hope everyone here finds this peace.

**Upcoming**: The following is a rough plan for 2018: half-marathon in February (1:24?), full-marathon in April (2:55?), two-week vacation across Middle America in April, half Ironman in August (5:15?), three-week vacation across Northern Japan in September, half-marathon in October, and full-marathon in December. Other projects for 2018 without set dates: construct an astronomy exhibit for the museum (possibly opening my own small museum), become a volunteer running coach (possibly becoming certified through RRCA), regain some proficiency in Japanese before the trip, play all of the Nintendo Gamecube games that I bought ten years ago and never touched, bench press my body weight (155), bowl a 200 game or possibly a 600 series (last bowled 200 when I was in a league eighteen years ago), watch Game of Thrones, play Final Fantasy XV all the way through once it gets a PC release, and significantly improve the appearance of our driveway. I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors and doctorate before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years, entirely with CVS. $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k).

**Background**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

482,Would the economy collapse if everyone were smart with money?,,1707,f8brio,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f8brio/would_the_economy_collapse_if_everyone_were_smart/,1582475645.0,"The inspiration for this came from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f869wg/a_great_example_of_betteridges_law_of_headlines/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) which alluded to the ridiculous notion that the economy might suffer if people saved more.  Dave Ramsey sort of answers the question [in this video](https://youtu.be/HHQxXUYNc0Q) but I wanted to expand on the explanation and open a dialogue to hopefully enlighten us all.  For the sake of clarity and a simpler discussion, I'm going to leave out nuances of economics that don't change my overall argument.

I'm no economist but I did take a few econ classes in college. Whenever I encounter questions about the economy as a whole, I begin by going to the simple example of two people stranded on an island with two sources of food: fish and coconuts.  One person fishes and the other gathers coconuts.  At the end of the day, they trade and have a nice dinner.  They only need to gather what they can eat before it spoils because anything beyond that is wasted effort.  If the coconut picker harvests twice as many coconuts as needed in one day, she can take the next day off and not work.

Now let's scale the example up. Add several more people on to the island  until we have a village and each person can perform an additional task beneficial to the community such as by being a carpenter, a chef, a nanny to watch the children,  etc. Eventually, it makes sense to use a medium of exchange (money) to make trading goods and services easier.  As a bonus, money doesn't spoil as food would so it's possible for someone to save enough money to live for a month and take a whole month off work.  Or a year.  They've already put their work in.

How does investing work then?  Suppose that our coconut picker makes an investment in her coconut picking business by hiring the carpenter to build her a ladder to make it easier to pick coconuts.  She can now pick coconuts in less time than before.  Suppose she uses this extra time to further invest in her business.  She begins planting coconut trees near the village so she doesn't have to carry them from all over the island. Now she has even more free time so she begins breeding coconut trees to produce larger coconuts. Eventually she could hire someone to pick coconuts for her and she might not have to work at all.  Or she could pursue another endeavor and add even more value to the village.  The village gets the same number of coconuts as before even though she does less work.  This is the return on her investment.

In the video above, Dave Ramsey explains the fallacy in arguing that the economy would suffer if everyone were good with money.  In fact, the exact opposite is true.  The fallacy, he explains, is that the argument is predicated on the notion that in the economy if one person wins, someone else has to lose.  This is simply untrue.

In the example above, who loses when our coconut picker works extra hard and takes a day off?  Who loses when she invests in a ladder and harvests coconuts in less time?  The village still gets the same number of coconuts it always had and she has more free time.  She might relax in that free time.  Or she might work more and use the extra money to have the carpenter put an addition onto her hut.  The carpenter has more work, gets more money, and can save it or use it to invest in new tools.

Our modern economy is much more complex, but the example is still instructive.  When we invest our money, companies have the resources to improve their products and services, making them better, cheaper, or more accessible.  [This video](https://youtu.be/GnJCOof2HJk) does a great job explaining how investing in the stock market results in better/cheaper goods and services as well as additional money to the investor.  The more money we have, the more we can invest.  The more we invest, the better/cheaper goods and services get.  The better/cheaper goods and services get, the better quality of life we have and the more money we have to buy goods and services as well as to invest.  This positive feedback loop continues to advance society.  This is how we go from hunter gatherers to Macbook Pros.

So now we see how investing is helpful to boost the economy but what about savings?  Savings can help boost the economy by reducing waste in our economy.  By waste, I mean effort that is expended that isn't a net benefit to society as a whole.  For example, if you lose your job and can't pay your auto loan, then the bank will repossess your car.  The bank has to pay a repo man to find and repossess your car, the car has to go to auction, the car is then resold to someone else, the bank's accounting department needs to write off the loan, you need to find alternative transportation, etc. All of this effort wouldn't have to be expended if you had some money saved up and either continued to make payments or bought a car with cash from the beginning.  

But what about the repo man and the accountant?  They would lose their job if nobody defaulted!  Yes, they would and that would be great for everyone involved.  First, you wouldn't be in the situation where your car got repossessed so you could avoid all the stress and hassle and taxes when your loan is written off.  Also, the repo man and accountant would be free to work to create something positive for society rather than cleaning up a mess you.  What mess?  The mess that was created when you defaulted on your car note.  People who argue that argue that it would be bad if nobody defaulted because the repo man would lose his job are making an error in logic known as the [broken window fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window)  The flawed argument is that something destructive, such as breaking a window, is good for the economy because it creates a job for someone to fix the window.  But if the window does't get broken in the first place, then nobody has to fix it and everything is the same.  Taking the broken window fallacy to a logical extreme, we should all burn down our houses because it would create a lot of jobs in construction and improve the economy.  Obviously this would not be a net benefit to society!

So what would happen to the economy if everyone were smart with money?  There would be less defaulting on debts, less waste due to not having to clean up defaults, goods and services would become better and less expensive, people would be able to ride out recessions and retire earlier.",financialindependence

It wasn't too hard to hit a 50%+ savings rate since I lived with my parents for half those years. I only paid enough rent to cover the food + entertainment + utilities. In our culture, multiple generations often live under the same roof. Children are expected to take care of their elderly later on.

I eventually moved out in my mid-20s when I bought my 1st home, and then I later returned to my parents' home (in the SF Bay Area) a couple years later after selling the house for a $150K profit. I then moved out again in my early 30s when I bought my 2nd home in SoCal.

Considering that I've only made roughly $450K post-tax from work over the past 11 years, I'm pretty happy that my net worth is roughly twice my cumulative salary. That's a testament to passive income. I don't have any side jobs or blogs for supplemental income, so everything's coming from my day job and from passive investments.

I also wanted to mention that I really admire my parents for how well they've done despite their lack of upbringing. Neither of my parents went to middle or high school due to growing up during a civil revolution. They also got separated from their families during childhood and had to work as indentured servants for 5-10 years of their lives. That really toughened them up mentally. They eventually studied hard to get into colleges and have been working STEM jobs. There's no way I would've gotten this far with having a privileged (though somewhat draconian) childhood due to them. I don't make anywhere near what they make, but I've always valued the freedom of my work.

**Asset and Chart Info**:

Link: [Net worth chart](https://imgur.com/a/tQDON9g)

**Net worth:** I started tracking my net worth in 2014 with Personal Capital

**Investments (non-retirement):** Individual investments (mostly VTI, VNQ, and other index ETFs), some REITs.

**Retirement accounts:** Roth IRA, Trad IRA, 401K (+5-10% company matching)--most invested in total-market ETFs/funds.

**Properties:** I bought 2 homes ($150K condo and $450K townhouse). I used them as primary residences, not as investments. The charts show the estimated value minus the mortgage. I got super-lucky finding the 1st one and selling it for a $150K profit.

**Cash:** Originally tracked by Personal Capital. I later updated the charts with values from bank statements.

----

**Edits and Clarification**: Yes, I realize it's 11 years, not 10. I can't fix the title.

I'm not sure where some of you guys read that I inherited the homes. I bought both of them. My parents are both alive and well, and they plan to donate most of their money.

My retirement savings goal is around $3-5M, so I'm still far away. I eventually plan to have kids, and I expect them to eat up a decade of savings.",financialindependence
484,The opposite of FIRE,,1700,g49vt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/g49vt2/the_opposite_of_fire/,1587311481.0,"For about a decade now I have been obsessed with the concept of FIRE: how to achieve it, how to optimize it, how it affects one's life. And it was only today that I suddenly realized what the exact opposite of FIRE was--and how much better it is.

It's a pretty long-winded road, but I've been rewatching the Sopranos, and I googled the actress who plays Tony's mother: Nancy Marchand. A well respected actress, Marchand had been in the business for six decades when she got into this role, and she played it until the very end of her life, even though she was recovering from cancer at the time. This isn't the first instance I've heard of an actor going on with the show despite a terminal illness; Christopher Evan Welch of season 1 of Silicon Valley also believed the show must go on, and gave one of the best performances of that series despite his illness.

These are people who carried on working despite the fact that they were going to die soon; retirement wasn't an issue for them--their problem was the opposite. At its core, FIRE is about making the money we earn from work last as long as our lives do, although our lives are longer than our careers. In these cases, these were people who were facing the fact that their careers were lasting longer than their lives were. And they kept working to the very end.

Why? Because they *loved their work*. This is the exact opposite of the FIRE community, who, at the end of the day, are driven to leave their jobs because they hate it.

One of the pieces of advice the FIRE community loves to throw out is that young people should choose jobs not based on what they love to do but based on what makes the most money--so that they can earn as much as possible as soon as possible and get out of the rat race. But there are many cases of people hwo chose to do what they loved, and they loved it so much that they kept doing it even when the money no longer mattered, because they were going to die soon.

We should consider this--and we should consider whether the idea of just saving as much as possible and working as little is possible is truly the best way to live a good life.",financialindependence
485,FIRE - Quite possibly the greatest thing in the world to fail at.,,1702,7v7uc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7v7uc5/fire_quite_possibly_the_greatest_thing_in_the/,1517763293.0,"While the hardcore Mr. Money Mustache Machine will tell me to go stuff it and point out how this community was better off before it went mainstream, I feel like far too many people following this FIRE business are missing the real point.

You see far too many people battered and weary saying shit like, ""I've tried so hard but I failed...I'll never FIRE on my salary. I give up.""

Acting as if their 1, 2 or 3 years of struggle was all for naught.

**Losing sight of the glaring truth that their entire future was massively improved due to their efforts. Even if they can out on truly aspiring for FIRE.**

Whether they paid down 1/2 of their student loans (or all of it), were able to get the down payment for a house together, raised capital to start a business or simply started a nest egg where there once was none....the lasting effects of even a short period of extreme saving are still there...you may not retire early but just 1-2 years of living well below your means makes a huge difference moving forward.

**Not to mention the fact that living a short-term bare bones existence leads to a number of passive benefits:**

- Those who live insanely frugally for a time are more likely to live at least somewhat frugally moving forward by habit or default.
- Going without for a while means that you really learn what things are/aren't important to you. 
- When you start to spend money again you TRULY appreciate things that you took for granted for years.

Personally, I am attracted to this community not because I dream of FIRE but because I love the concept of using frugality and living below your means as a tool for purchasing freedom. 

I prefer to purchase mine a little at a time, taking extended time off every year (mostly to travel) and putting myself in a position to be able to choose to earn less if I want to - but I really don't care if I have to work more or less until I die.

But we lived a very similar to FIRE mentality for about 5 years to save up for our dream business and to get it off the ground...and despite the fact that it's now been nearly 5 more years since we stopped actively tracking spending/savings and all that stuff, we spend a fraction of what we used to back in the day simply because living insanely below our means for so long illuminated where money was being wasted and where money spent was worth every fucking penny.

So if you're down on yourself for having thrown in the towel following a period of yearning for FIRE....don't be.

I think the reason people are so interested in the question is because it implies that FIRE (or at least the kind of FIRE most people are practically pursuing now) is unsustainable.

It frames financial independence as a zero-sum game where for every winner there must be a loser. Or at least that's the concern.

It seems that at least some economists are saying that the current stock market conditions aren't the result of irrational panic but due to a real decrease in demand for non-essential goods and services.  Some estimate that as much as [40% of our economy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-coronavirus-calls-for-wartime-economic-thinking) is based on discretionary consumption.

489,The (not so) Lost Decade: Investing early and often is the easy way to make a positive gain when the market is down.,,1696,f5o0l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f5o0l9/the_not_so_lost_decade_investing_early_and_often/,1582010444.0,"Hey /r/financialindependence! I was honored to win the ""Best Overall Submission/Topic of 2019"" with [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/) and I wanted to follow it up with another analysis I did! If you would prefer a visual journey, you can see it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/4bx7I7v).

# The Lost Decade

The decade of the 2000s (2000-2010) was a bad stretch for the US stock market. It started with the dotcom crash and ended with the financial crisis. The share price of the S&P 500 was DOWN about 22% in 2010 from where it started in 2000. It's referred to as the lost decade because the US Stock market didn't provide a return. But that's not the whole story...

# Don't Forget Dividends

For whatever reason, almost every stock chart in the world ignores dividends. Even most interfaces on Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab only show change in share price and ignore dividend payouts. When you look at the lost decade and include dividend reinvestment the market was only down about 7%, not 22%. But even THAT'S not the whole story...

# Early and Often

When you look at a stock chart, it's kind of this fictitious example of dumping all of your money in at the beginning and letting it ride with no additional investment. But that's generally not how people invest during their wealth building phase. Many do (and more should) invest **early and often**. Sure, if you dumped all your money in the market on January 1, 2000 and waited 10 years, you'd be down by about 7%. But if you did that you would miss a big buying opportunity when the share price is low. If you look at the ""lost decade"" a different way, as investing monthly throughout, it tells a different story. 

# Making Money in a Down Market

A $500/month investment from 2000 through 2009, with dividends reinvested, would $63,912. That's about a 7% GAIN (over the $60,000 total investment) when the share price was down 22%! That worked because when the share price was low you accumulated way more shares, and that value was amplified during the recoveries.

# It Gets Better

And if you kept that $500/month going for the NEXT ten years, when the market actually recovered, your $120,000 would have turned into $348,231.

# Looking Forward

In those ""terrible"" twenty years with two catastrophic market crashes, the market returned only 6% per year. If the next twenty years look exactly the same and you keep investing $500/month, your $240,000 investment will turn into $1,353,574.⁣

# Net Buyers

Remember that if you are a ""net buyer"" of stock, you WANT the price to go down. Just like anything you buy, you want to pay less for it. When you're a ""net seller"" (like in retirement) then you'll want the market to go up. But if you spent your working career investing early and often, hopefully you'll have plenty. Even having made money during the terrible down years.",financialindependence

This is the my third year following up on the [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/e6mdm0/from_10k_to_650k_in_65_years_with_graph/) and [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bjghrb/from_10k_to_500k_in_6_years_with_graph/) financial review posts.

Honestly, not much has happened this year with the pandemic. My wife and 1.5 year old toddler basically stayed (and attempted to work) at home since March. Spending is pretty darn low (about 36% of our income) but we've been cooking some amazing meals. Missed some awesome vacations and have pretty much settled into a ""I never want to step into an office again"" mindset. This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on...well today(ish).

**This graph is for two people, not just me as of July 2015**

Since the last updated I've:

* Started a second Amazon Affiliate site that is now generating 2k a month with zero effort.
* Kept my toddler alive and unharmed
* Built an awesome outdoor kitchen with only the help of my wife

Some answers to common questions are below:

* This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 29 years old, live in Houston, TX and have a 1.5 year old. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference we currently have around 191k in equity in our home and owe 148k (total value of house is \~340k) . We have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. We do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good. We'll pay it off in around 3 years or so. If you include real estate we've got over a million bucks!
* We keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when we bought our first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and we bought our next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we no longer have.
* Our taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* We have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Wife bough a new car this year (ugh) but at least it was a good deal and is less than $500/mo I think. It does not impact our savings rates.
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -> 74K promotion ->97k old job -> 115k current job)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -> 84k promotion -> 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-> max IRA's -> invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -> pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",financialindependence

Also I'd be eternally grateful if someone can point me to a way in Google Docs to ping everyone who's copied the incorrect sheet.  Thank you.

TL;DR I made [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkJMh5SkjzHPS_-1qUa4NWB7N-JVJWzqHqyuVzqy-i0/copy) to figure out how long you have until FI.

  


Hi everyone,

  


When I joined the FI community, I was immediately aware of everyone trumpeting their own spreadsheets. Initially, I didn't see a need for one; I'd track my spending and all, but I thought ""Who needs a spreadsheet, that's a lot of work just to tell you your savings are increasing."" Then I reached the stage where everything's pretty much set and it's a waiting game. Being moderately impatient, I was curious how much longer I'd have to FI. So I made this.

  


The main purpose of the sheet is to estimate the time it'll take to reach FI from where you are today. In addition to that, it charts how you're doing as far as savings rate, income, and spending.

  


It uses 12-month periods to do a lot of the calculations, because in FI, people are generally targeting an annual withdrawal rate. It also helps take some of the ""noise"" and ""chart bounce"" out, because yearly data is less erratic than month-by-month.

  


The spreadsheet comes complete with instructions on how to put in your own data, and you can change assumptions like projected market return and withdrawal rate. Let me know what you all think!

  


Again, [here is a link to the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkJMh5SkjzHPS_-1qUa4NWB7N-JVJWzqHqyuVzqy-i0/copy).

EDIT: I have changed the links in the post and the spreadsheet should now prompt you to make a copy when you open it (thank you u/blurryclouds).  If you do not have a Google account [this link may or may not allow copying.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkJMh5SkjzHPS_-1qUa4NWB7N-JVJWzqHqyuVzqy-i0/edit?usp=sharing)",financialindependence

&#x200B;

This week I got a phone call I was not expecting. My mother, who is young (pre-retirement age), eats well, exercises, doesn't drink, takes no medications, etc., has been diagnosed with cancer. Stage 4. She is optimistic, and I'm hoping for the best. But I know the odds.

It's extremely difficult to reach her via transit (different city, 2 hrs away). The day after hearing the news, I hopped on AutoTrader. Found three local cars that met my criteria. Test drove them. Within four hours of opening up the cars listings, I found myself the owner of a new (to me), reliable car, which will get me back and forth from me to her whenever I want. Didn't blink an eye at the $23k check. Easiest money I ever spent.

&#x200B;

This has been a shitty and harsh reminder of two things for me: first, that saving money to retire early is a worthwhile goal, because none of us know how long we'll be on this Earth. And second, that by living within your means, you're setting yourself up to be able to handle life's curveballs just a little more easily. I take a lot of comfort in knowing that I can drop everything at a moment's notice, and hop in a car that I can count on getting me where I need to be within a couple hours.

The news is in, we are down over $60,000 this month. Sounds pretty bad right?

Well I updated my projection charts with my new net worth, and well this has pushed my FIRE date out by a whole *3 months*!

Interestingly, each additional $370 spend per year forever pushes my FIRE date out 1 month. 

So the impact of the market drawdown is equal to additional expenses of $92.50 per month.

Every day people tack on these little extra expenses (car lease, gym membership, food delivery service) and they don't lose their shit over their lifestyle inflation, while the impact is the same as a global pandemic.

On the bright side, this also means that if I can cut $93 of monthly spend from my budget, I'd completely offset this tragedy in my FIRE journey. I can easily do that by cooking more, or biking to work, or some combination of both.

498,"The ""Freedom Chip"" - A Silver Dollar representing $100,000 in accounts.",,1654,gw2qt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gw2qt9/the_freedom_chip_a_silver_dollar_representing/,1591218610.0,"What do you like to do to help visualize and commemorate your progress toward FIRE?

Some may think this is a silly idea, but the money I've saved is essentially just looking at numbers on a screen displaying dollars at a bank somewhere. Sometimes that feels a bit bland- I wanted a way to commemorate and reward financial progress with something tangible. Compared with chests of jewels, precious metals and tangible wealth centuries ago... a few commas on a screen doesn't have quite the same panache!

So, for every $100,000 I've added to my net worth, I purchase a 1oz Fine Silver dollar minted that year. I call it a ""Freedom Chip"";  a little piece of the freedom I'll have once I collect enough chips. They are relatively cheap ($20-$30) and as a precious metal, are conceptually representative of wealth itself. The goal here is not to actually invest in precious metals, but just to serve as a ""souvenir"" along the financial journey. They're a big coin, relatively heavy, and satisfying to hold and think of as each representative of $100k. When I hit my FIRE number, I'll get a pure gold coin and make a nice leather pouch to jangle them around in.

500,My Parents' Hard Lesson: Homes can lose a lot of value even in the long run,,1649,9hggrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9hggrt/my_parents_hard_lesson_homes_can_lose_a_lot_of/,1537459126.0,"My parents bought a house in 1978 for $35k (inflation adjusted that's $135k in today's dollars).  Now, 40 years later, they are moving states and looking to sell.  The sale price estimates they are getting?  $80k to $100k.

The house is in Oklahoma City, which is growing but where land is basically free so the city just expands outwards, constantly creating nice, new neighborhoods on the outskirts.  But the state refuses to invest in anything (taxes are of the devil, you see), so those areas have to watch their schools and infrastructure slowly decay until the lovely neighborhood they raised their kids in turns into yet another ghetto where no one wants to buy.  Buyers instead flock to the nice new homes in the outskirts and the cycle continues.

In 1978 my parents decided to be closer to my father's family in OK rather than my mother's family in CA, and 40 years later that decision is costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars at the very least.

I suppose there are multiple lessons to be learned, but with so many people here posting confidently about how much their real estate will increase in value, I wanted to throw out a counterexample.  It *is* a gamble.  Don't count on it completely when making your FI plans.  Time in the market may be a cure-all for index funds to counter dips, but the same isn't true for real estate.

**2015**

* November- Enlist in the military. I had been working for a few years, but failed to have anything to really show for it. Sold my car and most of my stuff then I was off to basic training with a net worth of only about $3000, but no debt.

&#x200B;

**2016**

* November - Totaled my car, and thought I was going to be screwed on the amount I would get from insurance. The other party claimed injuries and for months I was certain I was going to have to come up with a fortune because of the accident.

I won’t get too preachy and will make sure to share as much detail as I can.  I know my favorite posts in the subreddit are the ones that include the raw details.  I’ll jump out and admit that Bay Area tech salaries are insane.  I work my ass off but do not pretend I am not very fortunate (touched on later in my advice below).  I also wanted to share that these career's and salaries are not just for engineers and computer scientists.

All reported amounts are invested assets.  This is less than networth but after the sale of my home back in Florida last year it is the majority of my network less a yearish in CDs/savings as an emergency fund.

**FIRE Goal:** $2.16M Invested to provide \~$75k Per year (3.5% withdraw rate) +400k Set Aside to Purchase a House.  (My original plan was $75k per year with a paid off house.  That was easy to think about in Florida, but I am not certain where I will settle just yet.  Current expenses when adjusting for non HCOL area have us very comfortable at 75k including housing costs.)

**Income:**  My partner and I both work for one of the FAANGs in the Bay Area and had total compensation north of $400k.  I also had a one time bump last year due to a house sale from back in Florida.

**Savings:**  \>$150k per year into 401ks, After Tax 401ks and taxable accounts.  I front load most of my employer investments each year (max out contributions in the first 6 months).

**Major Expenses:**  Usual Bay Area headaches with housing and childcare making up >$80k per year.  Luckily my FIRE goal also lines up around when they would be able to public schools for elementary.

**Allocation**:  53/36/11 (Domestic Equities/ International Equities/ Bonds) Remember this doens’t include my emergency fund which mentally I include in my bond allocation but do not include in the above.  My goal bond holding are 15% which I have been heavily investing into muni bonds the past year via contributions to get my ratio’s closer to my goal.

* [Retirement Projections](https://i.imgur.com/52nFe04.png):  Every year I model out my planned contributions along with very simple 5% gains.

**High Level Advice**

1. Just accept that you have been dealt a good fucking hand in this game called life if you are even in the position to think this is possible.
2. You can’t plan life.  If never works how you expect.  I could never have planned my career in the way it ended up.  Be opportunistic with new opportunities that you didn’t expect arise… but don’t burn too many bridges to get there. (Especially if you work in some of the more incestuous industries like tech).
3. Acknowledge that I am not just one person.  Going through the majority of my adult life with a like minded partner has had a huge multiplier.  Economies of scale are powerful.  Even just needing a 1 bedroom in a HCOL city while you are DINKs can allow for heavy savings in key early years.  Trust me I tried finding another couple with a kid to further take advantage of this but it kept attracting a weird swinger vibe.
4. Don’t overthink it.  The basics of FIRE are not complicated.  Just save as much as you can.  As you progress don’t let life inflate too much and keep your savings rates high.  Don’t kill yourself here.  Live the life you want now.  That might be the same one in FIRE (minus the job) or it could be completely different.  But it is your life and you only get one of them.

**College -> Career Progression Story**

I am not special.  We both graduated in the middle of the great recession with damn liberal arts degrees (economics).  I wanted to go into banking but the career fairs at my state university in florida were spartan.  Friends with top honors were getting their offers rescinded from the key players and I couldn’t even land an interview.

Luckily one of those companies still showing up to the career fair had a local internship for “Internet Marketing/Business Development”.  I interned with them the entire year primarily doing grunt analytics work in excel running very basic calculations but I was working with numbers and solving real problems which was more fulfilling than I thought.  The next year (summer before senior year) I had multiple internet companies very interested in someone with the exact experience I had.  I was still trying to get finance related work but outside of selling insurance there didn’t seem to be anything there.  I opportunistically took advantage of that random niche experience I seemed to have.

I graduated and kept working at the company I interned for.  I got more and more involved in the analytics side of things and switched to a bigger company where I could learn more from (As well as after a year of no raises).  Each job I invested heavily in the technical side of things, pushing my employer to pay for some training classes and showing them the value from those classes.  It started with Excel, then SQL followed by Python.  Each leaned on the job in an effort to my current job better so I could focus on the next biggest challenge the company faced.  Each time I did this I was involved in hiring my replacement for that role and training them.

4 years ago I get a call from a recruiter for one of the FAANGs for a Data Science role.  I never really considered what I was doing more than data analytics, product analytics, web analytics or even just internet marketing but if the bay area wanted to call me a scientist that was fine with me.  This was the biggest salary jump percentage wise of my career.  That said I wasn’t kidding myself.  I knew rents in the Bay Area were insane and calculated that it would only be a marginal raise.  I didn’t factor in how much my salary would continue to increase while holding expenses constant.  This allowed for extremely sizable savings the past few years.

My plan was to that for 5 years and go back to Florida and be one those California assholes who complain about how cheap everything is.  That said I extended the “5 more years out here” every year.  I have continued to progress into a data science manager and feel challenged by the problems I have to solve every day.  I still want out but feel it would be insane to leave this beautiful golden goose in what feels like the absolute best time ever to be in tech.",financialindependence

2  Quitting work forever may not be for you. 

After a few months of travel, I grew a bit restless and wanted to come home and achieve great things again. Taking time off re-energized me and created a thirst to learn new things. I worked for the same company but eventually left and I've achieved things at my new company I could only dream of before. I also realized I wasn't ready to quit work completely.

My father worked hard his whole life to try to give the best life for his family.  While we were certainly never rich, he felt it was important to give his kids every chance at success in life, including paying for all four kids to go through college.  That financial burden, along with a career that was far from stellar, forced him to work through his mid-seventies.

&#x200B;

Working long hours in a thankless job and battling cancer along the way took a toll on him, both physically and mentally.  He understood money, and knew he had to work until he had a certain amount of savings.  Unfortunately, he didn't get to his ""number"" before his health declined.  He has been retired for almost 10 years, but got to the point where he can't enjoy the fruits of his labor.  His health continues to decline and most of his time is spent in his house.

The thought of working so long and hard that I can't enjoy my later years has haunted me.  Since he uttered those words, I have been focused on maximizing my savings and have put together a financial model where I know I've worked long enough to be financially secure...but not too long.  This focus has put me very close to my FI number.  Thanks dad...you gave me the kick in the butt I needed to set an important goal and achieve it.

1- This is primarily a *pre-retirement, accumulation phase, calculator* .  this means it will calculate how long it takes to get to some target amount of invested money.

2- If you want to figure out how much money you need in retirement, the calculator just uses the 4% rule on retirement spending, but u/EngagingData has a *post-retirement calculator* you can use to dial that fire target number in more carefully here: [https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/) . It also brings in life expenctancy into the picture as well.

3-  u/EngagingData has an even more detailed calculator focused on [Visualizing the 4% rule, and safe withdrawal rates](https://engaging-data.com/visualizing-4-rule/). This gave me a much better understanding of what the Trinity Study does, the details of the historical simulations, and the relative safety of 4% or other withdrawal rates.",financialindependence

I'm a 25 y/o male engineer in a LCOL area with a net worth of \~$180k.

I have been out of college for four years and working full time.  My savings rate has ranged from 40% starting out, up to nearly 65% last year.  While by most financial measures I was doing very well for this stretch, I noticed a trend.  The more money I accumulated and the higher my SR grew, the more I became obsessed with my finances.  I began depriving myself of experiences and social activities.  I'd regularly turn down a night out with friends, or skip a lunch with coworkers.  To sum it up, I was not happy with the life I was living.  I had reached the threshold where my SR was painful *for me*.

Fast forward to 2019, and I decided it was time to make a change.  As uncomfortable as it felt at the time, I reduced my SR by 10%.  The disposable portion of my income now HAD to be spent (I'll admit, a few dollars here and there end up being invested but I try to spend most of it).  I'm currently shooting for a 55% SR and I cannot tell you how much more I enjoy life.  I went from feeling like I couldn't spend a dollar that wasn't strictly budgeted, to travelling with friends, going to concerts, and enjoying the pleasures of life.  That 10% made all the difference in the world, so I urge you wonderful people to not deprive yourselves too much of the life you want and risk burnout.  Plan for the future, sure, but realize that nothing is guaranteed.  Strive to balance the wants and needs of the future with the wants and needs of now.

I now believe that spending money on experiences that don't directly yield you money (or greater earning power) can be worthwhile if you're smart and deliberate about them.  In six months, I transitioned from wondering how I'd manage to drag myself through another 10 years at work, to enjoying daily life enough to not mind working another 30 years if I need to.  Work weeks now feel calm and relaxing as opposed to being a grind, as bizarre as that sounds.  

The ""sweet spot"" of SR that I found is highly personal.  When you find yours, you'll be challenged to spend money wisely (because a life devoid of stress and challenge is not a meaningful one), but there will be ""enough"" left at the end of the day for you to pursue happiness with.  

May you all find a life of balance, satisfaction, and a warm feeling of ""enough."" :)",financialindependence

Here is an image to look at:https://imgur.com/PL9tyrP

The above graph looks at the distribution of 5-year returns after the market has reached an all-time-high (using daily SP500 data from 1950 to 2019) and comparing that with 5-year returns for every single day in the market.  The point of the graph is to show that the returns for all-time-highs are not significantly lower than average market returns (and in some cases, like the 5 year case) actually have a higher mean return than the average market day case.

The takeaway is that you don't know what the market will do on a daily basis, but historically it's mostly gone up, and it doesn't really matter which day you start investing or put that lump sum into the market.  (Of course you can pick out a specific case where that isn't true, but without knowing what that is before-hand, you should just invest).",financialindependence

Notes: 

* Taxes include federal, state (NY) and property tax (~$3k)

* 2005 was a partial income year. I graduated in May and started working immediately.

* 2020 data is extrapolated / estimated

* The charts are the result of mining my financial and tax records to put the story together. I hadn’t been monitoring my NW until last year.



2005: Graduated college - I only had about $40k in school loans when I graduated in 2005. People graduating today won’t have it quite as easy since tuition doubled (at my school; others have more than doubled). But you can still do some of the things I did to minimize expenses. First, go to a community college for the first two year and then transfer to university after that. This essentially cut my tuition in at least half. Plus, I lived with my parents in those two year and saved on room and board. Also, when I went away to university, I lived off campus in an apartment with friends. This ended up being cheaper and more fun.


2006: Purchased home for $61k – It’s a modest home in a LCOL area. This was a tough decision at the time because I could have afforded much more. But I am glad I didn’t make myself house poor. The house had everything I needed, and I enjoyed doing affordable upgrades.

In the years to follow, I would contribute to 401K up to my company match, max out Roth IRA and the rest would go to debt. A financially savvy person wouldn’t have paid off my mortgage so quickly. But given the crappy stock market performance in those years, and relatively small loan, I am not sure it made much difference.


2011: Mortgage was paid off

For the next 8 years I was on auto pilot. I was single and spent a lot of time working. Didn’t increase my spending much at all and my increases in salary went to savings. 

I still enjoyed life, traveled whenever the opportunity came up, and did little things like having my shirts dry-cleaned (because I hate ironing).  But otherwise didn’t spend a lot of money on material things. 


2019: I found this sub and started looking at my finances closer. Before this, I hadn’t every added everything up to determine my net worth. I knew I was in a good spot, but was pleasantly surprised to see my net worth over $800k at that point, then watched it cross $1M at the end of 2019 (when I included my home equity). The really great thing though, was when the market tanked after covid, I was knowledgeable enough that it didn’t faze me at all. I knew the market would go back up and it did. 


A few changes I made after becoming more financially educated:

* Set a FI goal and started a spreadsheet to track progress

* Changed my Roth 401k contributions to Traditional (should have done this years ago)

* Started mega backdoor Roth IRA contributions

* Put the $100k from my High Yield Savings (HYS) into the market 



That’s about all I have to say.

I'm freaking out a bit, but I'm ready.  I've been planning for this for many years and cannot wait to get started on the huge list of things that I'm retiring to.  :)

\[Edit\] - Responding to questions from the comments.  :)

The Industry - Healthcare related.

The Roles - I spent the majority of my career in IS.  Started out as a very junior programmer and ended as VP supporting one of our global business functions.  Lots of ERP implementation and acquisition integration experience mixed in along with a bit of data governance.

The Numbers - I'd rather not share any specific details.  I'll just say that my AWR will be less than 4% and I'll be ""taking home"" the same amount as I am today.

The List - When I started FIRE planning in earnest about 5 years ago, I pretty quickly realized that you need to be retiring to something rather than from something.  I've got lots of hobbies and interests.  I'm also a list guy so I started writing down ideas as they came to me.  They are a mix of things I do today but want to do more of and things I want to try.  I did a lot of reading on how to have a meaningful life and came up with the idea of categorizing my list:

* Heart - Activities that make me happy.  Basically hobbies and fun activities.  A few examples:  Beekeeping, teaching myself to weld, working through an entire cookbook over the course of a year, working through the continually growing stacks of books, Lego building.
* Mind - Activities to try to keep me sharp:  Learning 3D printing, taking online classes, a bit of IT strategy and leadership consulting.
* Body - Activities to stay healthy:  More marathons (regular and ultra), P90X, yoga.
* Soul - Activities to give back:  Non-profit board work, reading mentor at a local elementary school, getting involved in local politics.

(Note:  Those are only a few examples from each category.  The list is huge.)

My intent is to do at least 1 activity from at least 2 different categories every day.  One of my very first post-retirement projects will be to build a balance scorecard where I can log what I do.  I figure that I can have a balanced, rewarding, and meaningful life if I keep a good mix across all of the categories.  I know this approach isn't for everyone.  I'm feeling good about it and totally reserve the right to adjust as needed!",financialindependence

I don't think any financial situation would have prevented us from calling the $5k ambulance that in the end couldn't help, but having a healthy emergency fund was helpful over the following days; planning a funeral for your toddler is hard enough without having to worry about being able to pay for it and the incoming medical bills.

&#x200B;

Returning to work was difficult. I had been planning to begin aggressively searching for a new job, but knew I was no longer in a good mental place to be doing so.  Commuting became psychologically stressful, as did any slow time in an office where sympathy dried up almost immediately after the initial donations card.  I hated leaving my wife at home alone, and while remote work was entirely possible both with my employer and my job responsibilities, it was looked down on by my direct manager.  In hindsight I should have burned all my PTO getting away from it for a bit, but I worried that that would simply leave me with no safety net from a job I hated more and more and in the end my biggest problem was unsolvable.  If I had true ""FU"" money I'd likely have never gone back, and certainly wouldn't have stayed for long with how things went.  I began receiving poor performance feedback, somewhat justified but also inconsistent. I think the decision was made long before I was actually fired but the song and dance had to happen first with constantly shifting goals that made it impossible to lock down much to defend myself with if I had even wanted to. Walking out for the last time ended up being freeing.  Job-hunting isn't stress-free, but I'm less stressed now that we're living on our emergency fund and liquid assets than I was in that job.

&#x200B;

I hope none of you ever have to directly apply the lessons I've learned here, but in a more general sense, FI is about so much more than early retirement, though that used to be the main motivation for me. There are problems FI can't solve, but FI does give you space to focus on those problems without letting money be a distraction that prevents you from healing.  Our FI situation could certainly be better, but we're stable enough that I can set those matters aside for a day and focus on my daughter's birthday or a random Tuesday that ends up being really hard.

Its fine to talk personal finance and encourage people to also pursue FIRE. Share strategy and general goals, but don't go into your specifics. I wish I would have received this advice early in the FI journey. Money has suddenly become a contentious issue with a family member after  that person asked me for a substantial loan. I never would have anticipated this person making such a request or being upset by my refusal. I greatly regret ever sharing my financial situation. 
***Follow up: Thanks for all the comments. To those suggesting cutting off contact, in my case I don't think it is a relationship ender, just some unnecessary drama that I hope will pass with time. To those that said they are selective about who they tell, I would have agreed in the past, but no longer do. I am still a proponent of talking finance with friends and family. I simply suggest leaving out numbers during those conversations. There's little to be gained by sharing your salary or net worth, but a lot of potential downside. 
***Follow up 2: A lot of people have pointed out that not sharing salaries held their pay back. While I agree that this is a taboo that hurts employees and benefits employers, I think that discussing salary with coworkers also carries significant risk.

I know my favorite posts in the subreddit are the ones that include all the raw details so i’ll do my best to include the relevant information.

Quick recap: 32 year old couple in the SF Bay area both working at “FAANG” companies in non-engineering tech roles (ie Senior Data Science Manager for me) and our plan is to be able to retire by 35 but am currently a few years of schedule (wasn’t the case 3 months ago so I take that with a grain of salt).  Earning fairly “Fat” bay area salaries but have more modest spend goals in retirement \~75K (excluding housing).  I debated whether I should update this year since it feels strange posting mid-pandemic but felt it would be helpful for others to see how crazy the swings can be and how unpredictable rebounds can be (see charts below).  

We both graduated in the middle of the great recession with non-STEM liberal arts degrees (economics) from state colleges. I wanted to go into banking but the career fairs at my university in florida were spartan. Friends with top honors were getting their offers rescinded from the key players and I couldn’t even land an interview.  Luckily found opportunities at local tech start ups and two jobs later was recruited to the Bay Area for nearly the same base adjusted for COL but clearly much more upside (full base salary history at the end).

While 2020 has been rough trapped in a yardless apartment with an active toddler we are fortunate enough to both have remained employed (knock on wood).  Covid also tossed in another interesting future option around longer term remote work outside the bay while maintaining \~90% of bay area salaries.  So my original plan was to FIRE at 35 could turn into more of a glide out (really wanting to get out of the Bay Area ahead of my toddler starting elementary school).

**Overall Investment Value as of 8/7**:  $2.3M, +54% YoY  (prev. 1.75M)

* 290k from new contributions (large chunk from liquidity event)
* 260k from gains + dividends
* Current Asset Allocation: 53/33/14 (Domestic/International/Bond) 100% in low cost index funds
* Account Split: 57% Taxable (normal broker), 30% Pre-Tax (traditional 401k), 13% Post-Tax (roth) 
* This is the majority of my networth.  I own zero property, no vehicles, no debt of any type.  Have an additional 300k in savings

**High level goals:**  

* Targeting >$75k annual spend ($2.5M @ 3% withdraw housing & education).  I am nearly at $70k @ 3% withdraw rate today but still need another 2 years for the next two bullets (might also just bump up target to around 100k… have flexibility here and 1-more year syndrome is very real).  Current spending is \~12k per month of which 70% is housing and childcare.
* \~500k available for house purchase in MCOL city; something like a Portland, Nashville, Austin, I am originally from Florida… so not there.  Need to do more research on full tax treatment and public schools (ie TX has no income tax but high property tax so could be worse off than states with higher income taxes).
* 4-Years College paid for my toddler (state school level, \~23k per year est)

**Income:**

* Base Income:  $400k \~6% Increase (includes my partner, yes i know this is ridiculous)
* Equity: $300k (1-time step change due to liquidity event but equity has also seen large gains in both new grants and company stock value over the past year, expecting at least the same for the next year but very much depends on company performance)

**Personal Base Salary History** (Later on equity contributes a large portion of my salary but isn’t included here, note: don’t get overly hung up on the exact ages/dates everything is within +/- 1 year but smoothed out to make doxxing a little harder)

* 2012: $66k (+10% annual performance raise)
* 2013: $80k (+21.21% Was a raise to get me closer to market salary and an effort for my employer to retain me, went along with a fancy inflated title)
* 2014: $138k (+72.5%, recruited to the bay area as a “data scientist”)
* 2015: $142k (+3%, percentage wise the smallest raise I ever received. Clearly an inflation based raise)

519,"A ""Normal Guy"" and his take on FIRE",,1572,bxyimn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bxyimn/a_normal_guy_and_his_take_on_fire/,1559934539.0,"It seems like there has been an uptick in posts on this sub recently of people making 5 figures wondering how on earth ""normal"" people FIRE, or why we don't hear more of their stories. I'd like to attempt to address that question by using my own journey as a reference.

&#x200B;

What's important to remember is that FIRE is more than the simple math and flowcharts you can find on the sidebar. It's a philosophy, a mindset that you apply in your everyday life. Often around here you hear the phrase ""spend less than you make and invest the difference."" For me, that takes the form of the following questions:

&#x200B;

What am I doing to maximize my income?

What am I doing to minimize my expenses?  
Are my current financial decisions worth the opportunity cost of financial independence/retiring early?

&#x200B;

That's it. A lot of folks who tend to contribute to this sub focus on these key elements. And rightfully so, that's led to quite a bit of success in escaping wage slavery. However, that's only one side to the philosophy of FIRE.

&#x200B;

You also see a lot of the phrase ""build your life you want to live and then save for it."" To be honest, the vast majority of FIRE stories I've seen on this sub haven't followed that path. I think that's because they went hard on the FIRE path, calculating their moves to most efficiently get out of the rat race early. And good for them! They should go fuck themselves!

&#x200B;

But I've taken a different approach. I am a high school teacher in rural Alaska. I love my job. I love the vast majority of my co-workers, my students, and even my bosses! Almost every day I wake up and look forward to going to work. Moreover, I feel an immense amount of purpose, and being in such a small community in such a small state, my individual decisions and actions can have large impacts and ripples. What an amazing opportunity in life to do good and be good.

&#x200B;

Not only that, but the lifestyle rural Alaska affords me is nothing short of amazing. I have an immense amount of freedom. With this freedom I can pursue passions and hobbies. I can (and do) garden, raise animals, hunt and fish, learn and practice carpentry and woodworking skills, hike and explore. I can do all of that literally right outside of my front door. And because I'm a teacher, I have a significant amount of time off to enjoy these opportunities to build this lifestyle *while I'm still working.* Most important to me, though, is that this lifestyle and career provides me with the ability to be the kind of father I want to be to my children.

&#x200B;

I do attempt to maintain a FIRE philosophy, mainly so that I don't end up as that old teacher who clearly doesn't care and is hanging on for their pension, and as insulation against potential political maneuvers that leave me out of a job. To me, that's the most logical use of the FIRE philosophy. But as it turns out, when you are living the life you want to live, saving for it tends to come second. I don't carry much debt, and I do invest, but I'm also willing to see buying a new chain saw as an investment so I can harvest timber and firewood. Those are investments that I consume, sure, and I can try and calculate the money saved by harvesting my own firewood and so on and so forth, but so long as I maintain fiscal responsibility those investments make me happy. And isn't this what FIRE is all about?

&#x200B;

 To be honest, when I read even the success stories posted on here, a part of me feels sympathetic. Yes, I, a lowly teacher living in a 1 room cabin in the Alaskan wilderness, feel sympathy for folks earning 6x as much as I ever will and becoming millionaires within a decade! Not because I'm not happy for them for escaping the rat race, but because they had to sacrifice a piece of themselves to achieve it.

&#x200B;

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that FIRE is merely a tool in your belt. I certainly could be doing my absolute best to figure out how to make low 6 figures with minimal disruption to my life. But not doing so is worth the opportunity cost. If you feel like you are stuck in the rat race earning 5 figures, by all means figure out a way to game the race in your favor.

&#x200B;

Or, you might be able to build a life for yourself that you don't feel you need to escape from, and use the tools you can find here to maintain financial security and fiscal responsibility.

&#x200B;

And if you're a part of the latter, like I am, you aren't likely to post anything about your ""FIRE journey,"" because quite frankly it wouldn't really fit the narrow definition of FIRE. Your spreadsheets aren't really that impressive. You're busy with life outside of Reddit. You see yourself working towards financial independence, but not through the vehicles so often discussed here. The reasons are myriad I'm sure. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, that's the reason I suspect we hear so much from 6 figure earners on the coast, or recently FIRE'd folks living in Thailand. There are plenty of 5 figure earners out there, quietly working towards some version of FI. Of course, simple math tells us that it'll take us longer to get there, but for many of us that might be an acceptable, indeed perhaps preferred, course of action. So keep your chin up and work diligently towards building a better life, whatever that means for you. Seems to me like that's what FIRE is all about.

Edit: A lot of great conversation with folks throughout the day between chores and projects. I’ve tried moving conversation forward in good faith. I don’t have time to respond to everyone but I love some of the ideas you guys have. My main takeaway from this is that, if you’re comfortable enough, people earning 5 figures should share their stories, along with their FIRE goals and what they are doing to achieve FI/RE. I imagine the discussions to follow would be a net benefit to the sub!

Over the last couple of years, I've lowered my savings rate closer to 30-35% and really bumped up my spending (mostly in terms of eating nicer/better food, going to restaurants/movies/sporting events more frequently, new workshop tools) and my charitable giving (mostly to local charities or people in need). 

I can only speak for myself, but I feel so much happier than before.....as if I am living a more balanced life, which has helped in almost all areas of my life, including work.

If you would have asked them 20 years ago when they expected to retire, most of them would say at age 70.

Few of them thought about the challenges of holding on to their jobs after age 60.  

The first challenge is age discrimination.  A good percentage of the people I know in their 60s are not working anymore because they were pushed out of their jobs due to layoffs or trumped-up charges and fired.  Their employers thought they were too expensive, too slow and out of date.  And when they tried to get another job, few people would even consider them.  They were called overqualified.

The next thing that their younger self did not realize would happen was their bodies and minds went downhill in their 60s, making it hard to keep working.  It became nearly impossible to keep up with their coworkers who put in 60 hour weeks.

530,The principles I learned in 7 years here,,1545,ji1r8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ji1r8p/the_principles_i_learned_in_7_years_here/,1603661859.0,"I've learned *a lot* by surfing these subs.  I internalized it and am really happy with where I am.  I wanted to take a minute to pay it forward and distill what I've internalized into first principles.

First, a bit on my background.  I was always interested in being FI and know that money doesn't equal freedom, but it is an aspect of freedom (if nothing else, freedom from worrying about meeting basic needs).  I was saving heavily in my mid 20's but was also working for a nonprofit.  I was saving 50% of my income but it honestly wasn't amounting to all that much.

I wound up spending about a year teaching myself data science before and after work.  I was really motivated by the field and, luckily for me, it turns out to be quite lucrative.  I also started skydiving.  That meant moving to a shared 1 bedroom apartment with somebody I butted heads with so I could afford it and not overly sacrifice savings goals.   That was a tough call because skydiving is expensive, but it also made me much more risk tolerant and a generally happier and less reactive human.  Skydiving taught me that most of my fears were unfounded (evolution predisposes you to fear more than you have to) so I geared up for a big life change.

When I was good enough at data science, I quit my job in the nonprofit and moved to San Francisco to do a 3 month bootcamp program.  Everybody thought I was nuts.  That drained my savings virtually down to the last dime (with no debt though).  I got my first job in the industry making very little money in a role where I would learn a lot.  I loved it and got a promotion in (I shit you not) 2 weeks of being on the job.  That was my first 6 figure income.

Zoom forward four years and I'm at a major company with a significant equity stake, financially comfortable, and having just bought a home.  Not quite yet FIRE but getting close depending on how my company stock does.

Obviously everybody's path is different.  But principles are more universal.  With all that, here are the main principles that lead to my success:

1. *Find the global maximum*.  I was top of my game in that nonprofit with a relatively good income and title, but I was growing unhappy and knew I wouldn't make my longterm goals.  It was a tough call to quit, drain my savings, and move.  But I did it and now I feel like I'm in a global personal maximum for life satisfaction, earning, etc.  This means longterm thinking
2. *Stay balanced.*  I almost burned myself out on FIRE multiple times.  I started seeing everything as costs.  Be scrappy on everything but what makes you most come alive.   That's crucial for longterm motivation
3. *The best investments are always in yourself.*  Active recovery, eduction, socializing, etc. are the best investments you can make.  They're bad investments on the short term but great on the longterm
4. *Save on housing until you're ready to purchase a home.*   My rule was that  I'd live with roommates until I had enough for a down payment.  When covid happened, I decided I wouldn't buy a place until the market rebounded so I let my investments sit until they rebounded, sold, and purchased a home.  Most people lose too much money on housing
5. *Never pay interest.*  This is an exaggeration but it's the biggest lifetime expense for more people.  I pay some interest but both my small car loan and mortgage are below 3% interest.  That means, with inflation, my money is likely better in the stock market than paying back those loans.  So apart from that interest, I've been lucky enough to manage to avoid it like the plague
6. *Take risks and experiment.*  Most people are way too risk adverse, scared to place strategic bets.  I've lost a lot of money on risky things but have gained so much more in experience.  Spending thousands on bitcoin miners in the early days while on a shoestring budget?  Lost a lot on that.  But it resulted in learning an appropriate way to buy crypto and the net effect was many more thousands of dollars in gains
7. *Have mentors/models.*  If you don't do this explicitly, you default to modeling your behavior on whoever is around you.  Think of who your top models for behavior are (financial, relationship, etc) and figure out what makes them tick.  For me it was Mr. Money Moustache, some abundance-oriented technology thought leaders, and some anti-consumer friends who were militant about how owning things doesn't make you happy
8. *Don't defer pleasure.*  I came to realize that many of my thoughts on retirement were quite Catholic (thanks, dad).  In other words, I was deferring pleasure until retirement like my Catholic father was deferring pleasure until the afterlife.  Be fiercely present and enjoy today.  Finances are only one part of life satisfaction
9. *Have an abundance and growth mindset.*  Most people think of money as a scarce resource.  It's not.  Anybody can generate it given enough time and effort.  Think big picture and work incrementally towards it rather than accepting the career progression of your peers or employer.  Most people underestimate how much employers will recognize a strong sense of drive and personal responsibility
10. *Change is necessary.*  For the Buddhists, that's the source of all suffering.  Do we want to sacrifice the mediocre reality today for the option of a better reality tomorrow?  Most people are so change and uncertainty adverse they can't adapt to more beneficial situations.  Being open and curious and optimistic about change is necessary, otherwise the mediocre today seems like a better bet or you'll change and then quickly regress.  The opportunity cost for change is whatever situation you currently find yourself in.  Make sure you're ok with this and have the confidence to course correct if you get in over your head

*TL;DR - Reality is malleable.  You can achieve whatever you want as long as you take a step back, strategize, and then kick some ass.  If you adopt some principles and play the long game, you'll ace this whole life thing*

531,"I've saved $10,000!",,1547,8w1xa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8w1xa0/ive_saved_10000/,1530713551.0,"Hello [/r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence)! I've been lurking this subreddit for about a year and i'm proud to say that i've saved $10,000 at the age of 24! I started really saving at the start of this year. I know it is not actually much money, but it is my first step and it took a few months to get here. I'm eyeing $20,000 now as my next goal and I think I will be easier to hit the next target due to a change in lifestyle! I feel so much better now, not only because I have the buffer but because I never get to the point where my checking account is at $0 anymore. Not too long ago I remember being unable to afford to buy water from a vending machine at work because I had no money even though I was being paid well.

At the start of the year (not a new years resolution, it just worked out that way haha) I decided to stop being broke. Since I started college I always thought of myself as frugal since I never made super large purchases or bought expensive cloths or anything like that. What i've realized is that I enjoy food. A lot. Which is strange how much I spent on food since I am skinny. I went out to eat every other day, I bought expensive food just because I thought the cheaper food wouldn't be as good, I bought too much food and wasted some. I ate at work every day for breakfast and lunch, etc. I stopped eating a work, started making my own meals at home and eating breakfast before I went to work, and I also stopped eating out almost all together. I also plan how I shop more, buying the cheaper options when I can and buying things in bulk as much as is reasonable.

I also had (actually still have, trying to stop) shopping-while-bored syndrome, and while I would never buy anything very expensive I would always be in thrift shops buying small things that I did not need. Thrift shopping was my hobby. I've tried to stop doing that by taking up other hobbies that can fill my time when I am bored and that do not bleed money. I've taken up running , and i've also taken up fishing which is very low cost for a lot of fun. I want to learn how to clean and eat the fish as well, which would provide even more value.

Seeing the money grow is really very motivating, and i'm looking for ways to make it grow faster. I've thought of a number of ideas and finally acted on one just this weekend. I've been running for a while and decided to try dog running. A women in my neighborhood let me run her dog, she and the dog were pleased. I did not charge money for it, but I know she is willing to pay money for a regular service which is exciting.

I wouldn't have made any of these transitions had I not been reading this subreddit. I have new goals for myself and can now see myself being someone who can FI instead of someone who sees work as a requirement and can't afford water out of a vending machine.

Thank you!

Cal seems to have found most of the FIRE community is focused on these hard, meaningful projects. But I know plenty of us talk about getting through 100 video games or traveling. I'm tempted to go sit on a beach in Costa Rica.

534,Inflation is not a single number. Let's talk about it.,,1540,dv0rka,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dv0rka/inflation_is_not_a_single_number_lets_talk_about/,1573513921.0,"I have been thinking a lot about inflation lately.  I think we all look at it way too simply.

The typical view of inflation is like some magic number.  We simply assume: inflation goes up 2-3% per year, so costs go up 2-3% per year.  This is mainly based on the Fed; the Fed targets 2% inflation per year and manipulates interest rates to achieve it.

But it's not nearly as simple as that.  Inflation is dramatically different in different categories. Really, 'inflation' is no one thing, but is based on a formula called CPI, that weighs a bunch of different cost categories together, tracks their inflation separately, and produces a weighed average number which we call total inflation (by CPI).


When you break it down...[here's a full chart by category](http://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pricechanges.png).  Inflation looks like *this*, and averages to around 2% per year.

Assuming the ""overall"" number is roughly 2%/year... Healthcare and childcare have skyrocketed way faster than ""2% inflation"", and housing has slightly beat it.  However, housing is highly localized, and I'd argue that housing *has* skyrocketed past inflation in in-demand markets and simply lost value in low-demand markets enough to drag down the average.

 But we had 2% inflation because cars, household furnishings, and clothing had *zero* inflation, and technology has had *negative* inflation, driving down the statistics.

[Planet Money/NPR did a good podcast episode on the String Quartet Theory](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/757257796/how-a-string-quartet-explains-healthcare-costs) of inflation, which is basically that since increasing productivity increases supply, inflation will be naturally much higher in an industry where efficiency/productivity increases are not logically possible at high rates.  For example, the cost of a String Quartet has increased much more than 2% a year.  Why?  Well, a violin player can't play more than one violin at once.  By this theory, it's perfectly logical that Education, Healthcare, and Housing go up faster than ""inflation"".  Teachers can't teach more students at the same time, Doctors can't see more patients at once, and you can't create more land (and zoning laws constrict building vertically). 

Inflation being ""2%"" is a composite average.  If tech has negative inflation (gets cheaper every year), food has 0% inflation (efficiency increases counteract wage increases), and housing/healthcare/education have 4-6% inflation, (making up simple numbers) the fed is technically hitting the 2% average.

By this logic...we might expect these items to inflate in price...at *higher* than inflation...indefinitely for the forseeable future.  While things like food might underperform inflation indefinitely.  And this is perfectly fine and consistent with ""2% annual inflation"".

-----------


How does this apply to FIRE?

A couple ways.


For one, I think that it adds weight to the argument towards buying a house.  A lot of people do rent vs buy analysis' and in many regions (especially HCOL areas) have terrible cost/benefit analysis (landlords make extremely small returns in those areas, as well), and owning also hurts your opportunity costs.  But...the inflation protection is huge.  It's a cost people don't account for.  If we can expect housing costs to grow at faster-than-inflation indefinitely- *or even at inflation*- there's a great argument towards homeownership.


Look at it this way; if you retire early, and own a house...you're exempt from most of the inflation categories.  [Look at the chart again.](http://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pricechanges.png)  You're not going to go to college again, so you can throw that part out.  If you have kids, you have time to not hire a sitter.  And your cost of housing is *locked*; even if you still have a loan, the 30-year mortgage won't grow in cost.  In ten years you're still paying the same for principal and interest.  The *2% inflation* figure is an average of all of those categories, but *several of them don't apply to you now...*


Which means that for someone who is FIRE *and owns a house*...the only thing that actually inflates is healthcare and food.  We always assume the current 2% inflation trend continues; what if we assume *the sub-trends* continue too?  Food and beverage inflate at 2% per year.  Cars inflate at 0% per year.  Almost *everything else you buy* has negative inflation.  *Excepting healthcare*, your *personal* rate of inflation would actually be *negative*; everything you buy *except food* would get cheaper every year, and food would only be at 2%.  Of course, healthcare eventually becomes a big expense.  But the reality is that since you don't experience many of the things factored into the CPI (education, childcare, housing)...

Your cost of living would almost certainly rise by *less* than 2% annually, if you own your house.  That means that if you are following the Trinity study- raising your estimated spending by 2% per year- you might actually be conservative.  Your expenses will probably grow by *less* than 2% per year.


But if you rent, you'll probably be experiencing inflation closer to 2%.



**tl;dr:** Everything inflates at different rates, 2% inflation is an average.  A person who is FIRE and owns a house actually skips *most* of the product categories that inflate faster than 2%, so 2% inflation might actually be quite conservative; we might see our money going further and further each year, if we own a house.",financialindependence

I apologize for my shameless bragging, I'm just really relieved and happy about this and not a soul alive knows about my net worth so I can't exactly go out and talk about it IRL.

Some background. I've worked since my early 20s, have made anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 a year since, amount varies from year to year. I'd say about half my net worth is from my saved salary, the other half is purely investment gains from stock I invested the saved salary in. I live a pretty frugal and minimalist life, I drive a used car and live in the same starter home I've lived in for a decade. Material things don't really interest me, but I will spend money on cool experiences.

My original (naive) plan when I got out of college was to FIRE when I hit one million. I reached that 2-3 years ago and realized quickly one million doesn't go as far as I thought anymore. I still don't feel $2 million is enough. I don't love my job but the stress is manageable, so I'd like to stay until 40 and then leave. We shall see.

In terms of what investments I have, it's largely US large cap banks and tech companies. No early day bitcoin, no Google IPO, just good old fundamental analysis, value investing and buy-and-hold. I haven't bought any new stock for several, several years, I did almost all of my buying from 2009 to 2012 as we were stumbling out of the Great Recession. I thought we were in overbought territory in 2013-2015, so the stock market's rise since proves that I don't know what I'm doing and market timing is for suckers, heh.









[edit] I have gotten a couple of questions about my house and about my dating situation and what I spend money on. My house is cheap, I live in the south. Land is cheap here, even in the major cities. It was valued at around $125,000 before the subprime meltdown. It went into foreclosure then like half of the homes in my neighborhood. My lender obviously could not offload it in foreclosure, so it sat on the property for almost a year. No buyers surfaced because no one could get a mortgage loan. I scraped together about $80,000 in cash and put in an offer that was accepted. I was motivated by the $8,000 Obama housing stimulus credit, so my final bill came in at $72,000. The home is currently appraised at over $140,000. I need to update it on my Mint profile.

My dating situation. I'm probably never getting married or having kids. It's a personal decision, I'm too selfish and value my freedom too much to ever do either. Being a millionaire is a rather recent occurrence for me and I haven't told anyone, so I haven't and don't ever plan on flaunting money to get a lady to like me. It seems really sad and desperate to me when older guys do that and I don't want to be that guy. Just being myself, being kind and listening has worked in getting ladies to like me, amazingly enough. I feel exceptionally lucky that I didn't get married early and am divorced and miserable now. Like so many other guys my age that I know.

I caught the travel bug about two years ago. I travel once every 2-3 months. It is expensive but it's worth it, plus airfares out of my primary airport have dropped like a rock thanks to growing competition, cheap fuel and new fuel efficient planes like the 787 and A350.

536,Consider sharing your inheritance while you’re alive,,1530,a6gbjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a6gbjx/consider_sharing_your_inheritance_while_youre/,1544890209.0,"Now I’m going to be the person that references a post that references a post... but I thought this was worth sharing here. 

[This post from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a68t9p/anyone_going_faster_than_you_is_crazy_anyone/?st=JPPN34D7&sh=d5e671ac) talks about being lucky but don’t discredit the work people put in even if their payoff was “lucky”. 

And further, not to say someone is lucky because they received an inheritance... this is the point I want to touch on. There were many people who commented that they received X dollars from their parents but would give it all back to spend more time with them. 

You’re all on the FIRE track. Many of you probably hope to be able to leave your child(ren) with money when you pass to make their life easier. **But why wait until you pass away? With the sentiment of so many saying they’d give it back to spend more time with their parents.... why not give it while you’re still here to spend time with them?**

My parents have decided to do this. They’ve been retired 6 years. Not early, but on time (at age 60 they retired). Each year they pay for a family trip for my brother and I and our families and them. They use the money to spend time and make memories with us NOW! They’ve contributed sizably towards our kids college funds NOW so our kids can see how education is important to grandma and grandpa. 

Both my brother and I paid off all our debt, which were student loans, (except mortgage) before this began so they didn’t bail us out, but they taught us fiscal responsibility. Once they saw we mastered that, they let us in on their plan. 

To give us our inheritance while they’re still alive. To see us enjoy it. They’ve given generous Christmas gifts to us the last 5 years. They’ve been able to see us use the money and get married to our spouses. They’ve been able to see us start families and spend a little more to upgrade to the stroller we absolutely wanted but was a little out of reach. They’ve seen us be able to travel or replace the furnace without it destroying our budget for the year. They aren’t giving us huge sums, but enough that it eases the burden of emergencies  and allows us to enjoy some things we might not be able to at this stage in our lives. 

Furthermore, they are doing JUST fine with their investments and their pensions, that sharing with us isn’t preventing them from enjoying retirement. Heck this year alone they’ve gone on 9 different trips! 

You may think this post is spoiled and braggy.  Or that I’m “lucky”. We were never rich growing up. They made between $30k (in the 1980s) to topping out at $90k when they retired. They saved, were frugal, and invested for 30 years. And now, they just want to share it with their kids. To see us enjoy it while they’re still here with us to enjoy it ❤️

537,"36m, $2m, Last Day of Work Today. Lessons Learned from a 12 Year Road to FI",,1531,a65lb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a65lb4/36m_2m_last_day_of_work_today_lessons_learned/,1544800091.0,"I was debating if I should post/celebrate this here, but after seeing /r/fierymillennials [lessons learned from a break](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a5nue9/lessons_learned_from_a_9month_break/), and after posting here in /r/fi for the last 4 years, I thought I'd share some of my lessons from my career (and maybe sneak in a few questions while I'm at it).

# Where I Am Now

As the title (and my flair says) I'm sitting right around FI now! Our household consists of me, my wife who's a year younger and our 11-year-old poodle mix, living in the western US.

I'm a software engineer (full-stack web development) turned Product Manager working a career in tech - but never in what I'd ""high tech"" cities. Orlando and Salt Lake City have a great tech presence, but they're not exactly in the top 5 (or 10?).

With around $2m saved up and yearly expenses somewhere between $60-$100k, it's looking like we're in decent shape! Over the last 2-years, our expenses have risen as we got married, fixed up a house, went on 2 honeymoons, moved across the country, furnished a new place and settled in. I'm optimistic it'll drop down closer to the $60k side now.

Today is my last day at my job of almost 8 years (!). My wife is continuing to work at this time, with me on her insurance We've talked about it, and she knows she could leave as well. Her working right now makes this much more flexible as we test out our spending levels with one of us not working.

# How I got Here Financially

Luck. Hard work at times for sure, and lots of planning, but no one retires in their 30s without luck (windfalls or high income) or cutting expenses so deep that your lifestyle borders some hobo-chic.

My luck came in a few specific fortuitous financial events:

* Had parents that raised me with a ton of **self-control**. Learning to have money (even if you're not rich) but not spend it from an early age is a huge benefit.
* Went to a **state school for college** and graduated with no student debt. Scholarships and parents paid for everything for the first 2 years, then started working to take over all expenses by the end. I was soooo lucky to not get into the expensive colleges I applied for and have parents who could chip in that $1k/month to live on.
* Started working on **side projects** non-stop starting in high school, which helped my marketable skills continue developing (even if they didn't make money).
* Received an **inheritance** of $100,000 at age 24 when my mom passed away. Add to that another $150,000 from selling her house. That was in 2007, and the $250k promptly dropped to $150k a year later during the great recession.
* Worked, without gaps and saved at least 50% of my income each year from age 24 on.
   * Also increased my expenses significantly during that time.
* Went from **startup to startup**, eventually landing at one where I worked as hard as I could (sometimes 90 hours a week).
* That startup was eventually **acquired**, which was a nice $400k windfall.
* The company that acquired us went **public**, which was a nice $800k windfall.

There's a lot of luck to this. I was on my own FI path before this acquisition with a higher FI date in mind (40 if things went well, but probably closer to 44 realistically). Luck and events completely outside my control brought that date down 4-8 more years.

# What's Next?

After years working at startups, I absolutely love creating things and providing value to people. One thing I'm most excited about is the time to learn and build things without the need for them to make money. I've done some side projects, but hope to do many more now.

Other than that, the usual winter recreation! Playing Red Dead Redemption 2, rewatching all of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, going skiing and traveling to see family.

Long-term though, time will tell. If our spending is low enough, then we won't need additional income. If it ends up being higher than we expect and we decide we'd rather now lower it, I'd like to find a way to make a little side income without a job through side projects. Luckily there is no rush on that today. We have options, and time to find a passion that makes a little money is one of the best ones.

I do have a few things that I'm trying to do immediately. I'd be curious to hear how others have handled these:

* Stop identifying myself by my job role, accomplishments or work.
* Stop setting unachievable expectations for myself.
* Stop trying to optimize every day and be OK with progress.
* Start setting boundaries between side projects and personal life.
* Being OK with the idea that there are days I'm going to wake up where I don't want to do anything.

These are the immediate things I'm working on in my head right now.

# What Did I Do Well?

For things that I had control over at least, here's a few that stand out:

* I think the number one thing was **making myself invaluable to companies** I worked for. I did whatever needed to be done strategically in the companies - even if that meant changing roles or learning new skills.
* Stuck with **low-fee index fund investing** for 95% of my portfolio long term. I made investing mistakes (oh, hi Bitcoin), but they were limited to at max 5% of my portfolio.
* Tracking spending **quarterly**.
* Didn't try to **over-optimize investments**. Just let time do their thing (helps that this was the best bull market ever).
* Developed a strong sense of **what I wanted out of life** outside of work. I have no shortage of things I want to do.

# What Could I Have Improved On?

* I didn't **max out my 401k** for about 5 of my working years. I didn't have access to a 401k for another 4 years.
* My **spending grew** way more than I thought. I should've been looking at my spending monthly.
* My wife and I have been together for almost 12 years, but we didn't fully join our finances until year 11. We knew about each other account balances/debts, but not as much each others cash flow. Would've been useful in planning to know each other's **total spending**.
* Tracking **spending monthly** would've helped see trends faster.
* Creating **another source of income** would have been really nice.
* **Thinking too much about FI** at times was a distraction from other, more important goals and parts of life.

Whew, that's a lot. It's been 11 years since I started investing and 9 years since I opened a Vanguard account. Without additional lucky (in the form of those windfalls) I don't know how FI would've been possible without drastically cutting spending during my earning years far more than I did.

That might not be the most optimistic takeaways, but it's an honest one. There's a sliding scale between compromise and luck for retiring in your 30s. I was able to lean more on luck, but that's not a reproducible takeaway. If you do what you can with what you're given that's all you can do - just do your best and be OK with the results.

*Edit*

**On acquisition/IP money**: From the comments, I realized I did a poor job of taking credit for my part in those events. As a long-time developer, I don't do a great job of taking credit for my accomplishments. As I mentioned in some comments below, I was an early employee at the startup and led the largest team which was responsible for our main product, and was a key part of why we were acquired.

**On windfall/Why don't you have more money:** I wish I could say I just put the windfall money in low-cost index funds and called it day, but that wasn't the case. I bought a house (which I sold for a $70k loss), lost a bunch of money due to load funds and taxes on trades my financial advisor put me in (before I started managing my own money) and saw my investments drop by almost half in 2008. All that to say that in 2008 my net worth was much closer to $70k. Couple that with a lower income (since I was right out of college) and it's not too much being set aside each year.",financialindependence
538,So I just quit my job during a global pandemic,,1527,ia9pmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ia9pmr/so_i_just_quit_my_job_during_a_global_pandemic/,1597506678.0,"Been ""unemployed"" for a little over a week now and it still hasn't fully set in. The decrease in stress though feels great. Almost no one knows my financial situation, so came here to get a release. 

Path : I graduated from University in 1998 and joined a small hardware tech start-up right out of school. The company did well through the tech bust, I pushed to get as much equity as possible, and for a brief period I was worth (on paper) nearly $2M as a 23 year old. It unraveled quickly though and in the end I only cashed out a little more than a down payment on my home.

Later went on to work for a mega-corp’ish company that I had been working at for over a decade. Had my ups and downs there. Made them boatloads of money. Often liked what I was working on, but hated the corporate politics and bureaucracy. It only got worse over the years and eventually just gave up on trying to advance. Was interesting that my co-workers reaction to my resignation was a fairly equal mix of disbelief of leaving a cushy job without something else lined up during a pandemic and “I can’t believe you lasted as long as you did”.

I saved over all the years, but lost some focus on the savings during the middle part. But as work became less enjoyable I doubled down on the FI path. 

Stats :

Single. Early forties. HCOL city, but bought in early and small. 

Net Worth : ~$2.75M

Investments : ~$2.35M

~$1.5M taxable
~$800k 401k/Trad
~$75k Roth 

Home Equity : ~$400k with $15k left on mortgage

Currently at ~67% equity (70/30 US/Intl) and ~33% fixed income with a nice pile of cash to hold me over a couple of years if need be. Plan to glide-path back to 80% equities over the next decade which is where I’ve been for most of the journey. Vast majority of investments in low-cost index funds, some small single company holdings, and a little bit of active (especially for bonds) in retirement accounts. 

Biggest mistakes I made along the way :

Not automating my taxable investing earlier

Not utilizing HSA and backdoor Roth earlier

Sitting on too much cash along the way, though that had piece of mind benefits

I’ve been easily spending <$60k a year including mortgage. Was kind of hoping to have the mortgage paid off when I quit, but it will be shortly and for now what was budgeted for travel is going to that. Hoping to not go too much higher than this with new health costs added in. Will be threading the needle of income between Roth conversions, ACA subsidy, and keeping overall tax rate as low as possible. 

I’ve travelled extensively over the years (thank you miles/points from credit card bonuses and work travel) and plan to continue once the Covid craziness dies down but at a much slower and likely cheaper pace. Might go full nomad at some point, we shall see.

I’m most focused right now on living a healthier life. But I’ve also started working on some small business ideas with low start-up costs that hopefully could go into semi auto mode if they take off. I’m looking at any income I can bring in to just up the travel budget. Also will be volunteering (virtually right now) for some causes I believe in. There are several hobbies I plan to start or continue pursuing. Currently learning another language. Who knows I may get bored and go back to another job, hopefully one less stressful and demanding. I’m not fully sure what is ahead, but not letting that bother me in the slightest.",financialindependence

540,You’re probably closer to independence than you realize,,1520,iawqq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iawqq1/youre_probably_closer_to_independence_than_you/,1597599910.0,"Financial Independence, as most spreadsheets frame the idea, is the art of replacing your spending with investment returns. More quietly stated is an implicit promise that after you’ve done it, you’re free. Chasing that freedom is an incredible motivator if you’re anything like me. And you’re probably at least a little like me, if you’re on this subreddit.

Except, of course, we all know you’re never completely free. 

The outside requirements on a human life don’t stop at the financial. You still have to go to the doctors office to make sure your body is running OK. You need to take out the trash. Your desk gets messy and you have to clean it up. You feel guilty if you forget send your mom a card on her birthday. You’re not free, you’re still a human being. Just a human being with a lot of flexibility. 

And, of course, once most people do the math, it becomes clear that in order to get spending low enough to make it work, your part time job effectively becomes frugality. 

Being frugal isn’t a terrible part time job. You autonomously set your own schedule, it gives you an opportunity to be creative, you develop skills which have an impact on your life, such as gardening and thrifting. Frugality challenges your comfort levels at times, which in turn allows you appreciate luxury when it’s available.  For me, it’s pretty much the checklist for what counts as an incredibly satisfying job. 

I don’t have a problem with any of this. And as a thoughtful person who’s put some brain time into designing your life, you already implicitly know everything I’m saying. But it’s useful to say explicitly. 

I sat down this week to write a plan for what I would do if I lost my job tomorrow, and was barred from full time employment for the rest of my life. 

I was not shocked to discover that even without 100% FI savings, I could design several options for lifestyles where my FI goals of satisfying work, low stress, extreme autonomy, meaningful relationships, and security were accessible.  But what I was shocked to discover was that I could also design such a life without relying on any of my considerable savings or investments at all. The savings and investments made it a lot easier, but they really weren’t necessary.

It turns out the important part of this thought exercise was forcing myself to give up my current job. With that, I had to get rid of my own internal limiters: the unconscious need to project success to peers, the fear of giving up what I’ve already worked for in my current job, the iron clad spreadsheet and financial plan that I’ve been faithfully following for seven years, the fear of something new.

When all that creativity was being pointed towards the actual life goals, as opposed to purely the financial goals that I thought would help with the life goals, a lot of shortcuts became apparent. And I couldn't have done it without having put a tremendous amount of thought into clarifying what, exactly, I want out of life. 

Of course, I’m not quitting my job immediately. And it’s not like my current lifestyle is too far of a cry from my goal lifestyle. It has a little less autonomy than I’d like, and a little more stress, but we’re in the ballpark. 

But the lesson that I think is important to remember is that financial goals are easy to measure, easy to track, and easy to let swallow you to the point of distraction. Life is not a binary between FI and failure. Extreme saving is a tool, and only a tool, and it’s worth putting thought into what you need that tool for, and not just how to get your hands on it.",financialindependence
541,"Goals are overrated, Systems are underappreciated.",,1520,8q2cqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8q2cqw/goals_are_overrated_systems_are_underappreciated/,1528651905.0,"I felt the urge to make this post after what has seemed like a rash of ""I'm 19 and want to FI after I finish college"" and ""My spouse/SO is incompatible with FIRE! Wat do?"" threads lately.  
  
This is part reminder, part exposition: It ties directly to the concept of ""Build the Life You Want, *then* Save For It"" that the FAQ espouses. A lot of people seem to be forgetting the first part.  
  
There is a growing movement lately of focusing on systems rather than goals in life design, and using passion rather than *following* passion. This perspective has a growing list of advocates (including myself) but the best known figureheads at this point are probably [Scott Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrd5od9lyk) and [Mike Rowe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1i26RbrhM). Both of these guys have done a lot of work and public speaking lately upending the ""What you're supposed to do"" template that r/lostgeneration endlessly whines about. [Mike Rowe in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKzu86Agg0).  

What I'm getting at here, by the slightly long route, is a reminder not to focus on the *goal* of a certain number of net worth to the detriment of *being happy right now*. If you are doing something miserable to try and obtain a number, that misery is not going end once the number arrives. Refer back to any number of ""X year update post-FIRE"" threads in this sub and you will see this as a consistent theme. There is a profound amount of discussion in those threads on the topic of maintaining happiness requiring diligence and intentional action.

A good ""life system"" is going to allow you to pursue FI without constantly pining for it to ***be here right now*** because you will be happy along the way. Some of you won't like this because you get kicks out of running the numbers, but a well constructed set of systems and life responsibilities will eliminate any need to run projections, set dates, and have a net worth goal in the first place. That's exactly the point - you like doing math, and you'll probably still find things to project, simulate, and quantify well after reaching your ""goal"". Or you'll move the goalposts - there's a lot of that here - and be one of our many ""I originally planned to FIRE at $X, but now I think I need $Y"" posts.  
  
Ostensibly, the desired perpetual state for most of us here is happiness and security. Redundant systems (behaviors) that add security and happiness obviate the need for goals. Thought experiment: If you were completely happy and secure, would you care how much money you had? Then why aren't you working on those items rather than whatever arbitrary number your accounts total right this minute? Think about three sliding scales labeled ""happiness"", ""security"", and ""money"". Two of them, any two, will always be inversely correlated. Which two would you max out?

If you're young and starting out in life, may I suggest you at least consider the option of not pursuing FIRE explicitly, but pursuing a happy early career with a sensible savings rate? If your spouse is not interested in an FI lifestyle, may I suggest you look for ways to support his/her desired lifestyle AND yours at the same time, rather than attempting to convince anyone to change?  

The 10 years leading up to an accomplished goal comprise a *much much* greater portion of your lifespan than the few hours or days surrounding the moment in time that you happen to, say, pass 1m net worth. I would argue anyone out there would be better served by making those years, however many there be, the priority for positive changes and happiness - a great way to do that would be building, evaluating, and refining your personal ""systems"" rather than enduring another 80 hour week to get the goal a little bit closer.",financialindependence
542,[UPDATE] $500k the boring way,,1515,k8it0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8it0c/update_500k_the_boring_way/,1607355448.0,"This is an update of my previous post, [“$250k the boring way”](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/) and my original post, [""$100k the boring way""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/). I’ll recap as best I can but all the details are in those if you're interested.

**Summary**

Reached $500k (now $600k, sorry I'm lazy) net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 8 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Quick Recap** **^(that keeps getting longer am I getting old)**

My wife and I are both 32 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I’m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $250k net worth we:

* Both got graduate degrees.
* Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
* Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $116k for me and $54k to $80k for my wife.
* Had a baby and wife took some unpaid time.
* Bought a house

**Updates**

Second half of 2019: Nothing really happened financially but we did take a family vacay to NZ and Fiji for 2 weeks. Somehow made it work taking a 1.5 year old halfway across the world and can't say enough about how much I would recommend both places. Can't say it was always relaxing but I would do it again. Also found out we were going to be having another baby.

In the last update my job had just added on-call pay. I ended up with about $5k of this bringing me to $121k total compensation.

2020: Our son was born in early March right as the pandemic was lifting off. I still haven't decided if this was a great time to have a baby or a horrible time. Financially, our timing was (purposely) a lot better with the school schedule and combined with a new maternity leave policy at my wife's job, she didn't have to take any unpaid leave this time around.

At my job, I got another 5% merit raise plus COLA increase bringing me to my current base salary of $126k. Looks like I'm on track for another $5k of on-call pay on top of that. My company went all remote so I haven't been back to the office since the day my wife went into labor. I'm liking the work from home situation a lot and expect that I will be WFH at least 2 days a week once the office is open again.

We refinanced our house in the spring from a 30yr 4.5% down to a 20yr 3.25% loan which increased our monthly payment but saves us an estimated $120k over the life of the loan, so that's nice. I'm actually working on another refi right now to get down to 20yr 2.875% to save an additional $30k. I imagine I'll call it good here but hey you never know.

This fall when school resumed, we made the decision to drop my wife down to part-time. This has been our plan from the beginning: work 5 years to qualify for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program and then go to just 3 days a week in order to have more time for family but still accrue full years towards the pension.

On that note, we applied for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program in June as soon as my wife's 5th year had ended. Our application was rejected by our servicer Nelnet 3 times before being sent on to the Dept. of Education in September. It was a very slow and frustrating process but ultimately was worth the hard work, as we found out just last week that it was approved and $17.5k was instantly removed from our balance. I got a lot of questions on this program last time - all the details can be found [here](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher). We have just $10k of loans left now that we will let sit there until they start accruing interest again or are forgiven by the new administration.

**Chart**

[Here is our financial journey summed up in one line](https://imgur.com/VDa8UcH). It's definitely starting to look like more of a curve now. The inflection points that used to stand out just kind of look like noise now, so here are the relevant dates in list form:

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
3. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
4. 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
5. 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.
6. 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.
7. 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.
8. 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.

**Current Finances**

* $90k e-fund, $5k in an HSA.
* $326k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* $189k equity in our home
* \-$10k of student loans remaining
* Current savings rate is down to 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies.
* Monthly expenses have gone up quite a bit, looking like our budget is about $7k which seems crazy to me. Luckily daycare isn't forever I guess.

**Thoughts**

Salary

I mentioned in my last update that I was closing in on the salary cap in my current position. At the end of this upcoming January I will get like a 1% raise and be maxed in my band. Unfortunately to go higher means I would likely need to take on a supervisory role, and I'm not sure yet if that's something I want. I've been doing all the required trainings for that just in case but I really like the position I'm in now so no rush I think.

Now What

Student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. For 8 years now they have weighed on me, sometimes heavily (and that's even with knowing that our career choices meant we would be okay and get them paid off eventually). The loan forgiveness was something we carefully planned for. It's definitely a weird feeling to be essentially student debt-free after pouring so much time, money and energy into dealing with them. Luckily I can fill this void with a very long to-do list.

Near term, I need to put a priority on making a will for us and making sure all of the stuff related to that is in order. Along those same lines I'd like to get some extra life insurance going besides just the basic coverage we get from work automatically. Still haven't put a lot of thought into our strategy for saving for college. We are likely buying a minivan (please give me all your minivan tips and recommendations) in the next couple months. Longer term, we have started talking about what a home upgrade might look like for us.

**The End**

My third update (at least to me) seems even more boring than ever. Having a new baby and navigating the pandemic at the same time meant that in the past 9 months I really haven't had much time or energy to think about saving, spending, or retirement so it all just sort of happened on its own. Before preparing to make this update I hadn't logged in to categorize our transactions since June which is crazy for me. I basically stopped coming to this sub vs being a daily reader. I'm most definitely in ""the boring middle"" now.

In the last update I had said ""The financial peace of mind is extremely valuable to us as we navigate the wonderful and scary world of parenting"". Well since then, we doubled down on the parenting and added a global pandemic on top. We are extremely fortunate to still have our jobs and our health, and I don't take that for granted.

I understand the mindset, since I was like that in my 20s, although there was no FIRE community back then.  I just disliked work and wanted to stop doing it.

I successfully REed at age 44, but that is still over 20 years of working. After my first 4-5 years of working I realized counting the days/months/years was too depressing.  I settled in for the long haul and worked to make it as enjoyable as possible ignoring my goal, but still living below my means.

I tried to find companies that were good to work for and divisions with good bosses.  If I got a bad boss, I transferred or quit.  Suffering every day to grind out your FI goal is something you will regret.  If you are smart and capable, which is almost a requirement to be interested in this sub, then you can find a better job than the one you hate.

These days we get on this sub and read about people succeeding and ahead of us.  It makes us upset and even more determined and makes daily net worth checks and ever more spending cuts, which can suck the joy out of living.  

Outside of a very lucky few, most of us will still have to work 20-25 years (instead of 40-50). Being miserable for that much of your life is not good.  Try to find a way to enjoy it.

I was lucky enough to finesse enough government loans, grants, and scholarships to go to college, and now have student loans, but also have a job with great growth opportunities and a future in the six figure club. Progress is slow going and I hope that I will be able to stay on track, but most importantly I've learned and gained great advice from this sub specifically.

546,"Today is the day! With thoughts, numbers, and graphs [M 38]",,1503,hx6jj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hx6jj1/today_is_the_day_with_thoughts_numbers_and_graphs/,1595613371.0,"After 16+ years of employment, today is the day. I’ve hit my goal, I’m packing up my desk and leaving my job. In retrospect, my FIRE reddit user name feels  short-sighted...

**What FIRE means to me:**

I’ve been working on this goal basically from the start of employment, well before I heard the term FIRE. I’ve always been frugal and very interested in being financially independent allowing myself to work on my own independent projects. As a result, I’m viewing this more as financial independence, than retirement. I’m still a driven individual who wants to work on ideas/projects, but now I have the ability to take risks, work on what I find interesting, and ultimately I can fail on these projects. In addition. I also have the ability to take the time off giving me more time to travel and work on hobbies.

**The numbers:**

I’m 38, single, and my goal was to have roughly 75k USD a year (after taxes). After doing a lot of research and number crunching, the withdraw rate I felt comfortable using was 3.3%. That means my net worth target was 2.5 million.

Here is a graph of my net worth over time: [https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG](https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG). The first graph is tracking just my personal investment starting with 2008 as I didn’t track my retirement accounts over time until many years later.

It took me 10 years of working to hit the 500k mark, and then roughly 6 more years to hit my 2.5 target. It’s crazy how momentum builds in the later years.

**Allocation and performance:**

Here is a rough breakdown on how I invested my money

* 45% S&P 500 and growth index
* 10% Tech funds
* 15% International
* 15% Small cap
* 10% Speculation individual investments
* 5% Bonds

As you can see, I was a bit different from the ""tried and true"" FIRE strategy. I work in Tech and felt that will be the most influential industry as time moves forward. In addition, starting in 2012 I wanted some money set aside for individual investment, offering a bit higher risk/reward.

For the speculative investments, I only put money in growth companies I felt confident in never pulling out and that would continue to grow and change society. I also ensured that I felt they had a high barrier of entry for competition. These all ended up being tech companies. The majority of this discretionary amount was put into Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla. The first 2 of those have done quite well over the years. And my one potential flop, Tesla, has clearly exploded the last year. So I am quite fortunate and lucky these individual investments have done so well. And while they make up 10% of my initial investment, they make up 25% of my overall private worth now. With these, my allocation has out performed the S&P500 over the years by a decent amount.

And last, you will notice on the graphs that my 401k earnings did way worse than my private portfolio (or the S&P500). The offered funds had higher expense ratios, worse performance, and while I had a similar allocation to my private interments, it did significantly worse.

**Lessons learned along the way:**

2008 – This was the big one. I was lucky to have paid off my debts and just start investing in 2007, before the 2008 crisis hit. I learned a lot from that mess. When the 2008 crisis hit, I took my money out of the market after a 40% loss. Based on those results, I was frustrated and I decided to a large amount of the remaining money and put 35,000 towards a car in cash (missing the 2009 rally). Paying cash for the car seemed like the financially correct thing to do – Had I financed, that money in my portfolio would now be worth 130,000ish. While this seemed very costly at the time, learning this lesson early saved me much more in future mistakes. When this 2020 market dip happened, I remained cool, left my money where it was. At the end of Q2, I’m up 10% on the year. The amount of stories I read on people still with the money out of the market after this recovery, missing 40% recovery, hit home as the lesson I learned in 2008.

Advise from people on what is happening in the market – As I read investment analysis over the years on what the market will do, I learned that for the most part, no one knows shit about the future (myself included). I made a point to write down what the sentiment was and check 6 months later where things stood, it was wrong far more than it was correct. People in general are very emotional and overreact, I’m still shocked in how the market over reacts and then settles. I kept plugging in money constantly along the way, and that has worked.

**My take-always:**

* Don’t try and time the market 	(duh, but I had to learn it)
* You are playing a long game, don’t 	get scared and take money out as the market falls
* If you can, continuing to invest after a market fall is key. It's important have the emergency fund to help limit down-market hardships preventing investment.

**The FIRE plan now that I’ve triggered:**

As I said, my safe withdrawal rate is 3.3%. Some CAPE >30 models show that having odds of failing over a 50 year period, but I am OK with that smaller amount of risk. I also feel that past result of CAPE ratios wont have the same results as they will now. The market and fed reserve tools are evolving. Clearly this is totally speculation.

I’ve reallocated money so I have essentially 2.5 years of living money in bonds/cash. I’m taking a the approach where I will live off dividends and sold allocations in good and neutral performing years. When market years are bad, I will live off withdrawn bond money, and will be reinvesting dividends. I will then be replenishing the bond money after the market has pulled out of the recession.

I plan to continue living in a Medium cost of living city in the US. Being single - living in a good city environment with easy access to people, hobbies, and having a good place to work on my projects in paramount. I was debating moving internationally, but now doesn’t seem to be a good time to consider that, I will reevaluate that in future years.

**Conclusion:**

So that is it, hopefully this write-up is helpful to someone. It's certainly been valuable to gather my thoughts.

It’s not really “hit me” yet that I’ve made it. I’m nervous and excited for what is to come. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. If you think I’m overlooking something, let me know. I’m always evolving my plan and considering feedback is the best tool I have for refining. I’ll look to do a 1 year update next year.",financialindependence

2 years ago I was struggling to get by. Maxed credit card, overwhelming student debt, a landscaping job that I had hit the ceiling at $18/hour, and no marketable skills that would get me a better job. Life kind of sucked. I was depressed and I never found the motivation to cook, and eating out all the time just kept the cycle of debt going. It was almost easier back then to convince myself to buy a meal because what's another drop in the debt bucket? My perspective has completely changed now. I started viewing my job and current life situation as a prison that I had to escape from, which mentally it was. I decided to start looking for my own landscaping jobs that I would do after work or on weekends. Some of my customers would ask about gutter cleaning, window cleaning and pressure washing. Didn't want to give business away so I added those services to my budding company. I worked my 50 hour a week job, and did my own work after hours for a year. At the time, I was swept up in the extra money I was making, and the boost to my confidence that being semi self employed brought me. Looking back on that year...it was fucking terrible haha I have never worked so hard in my life, but I got through it. The first year went well, but I was still depending on my day job to get by. Decided to take the leap, quit the day job and the last year I've been 100% self employed. Worked my ass to the bone for the whole year, kind of burnt myself out a bit, but I payed off $15,000 worth of tools and $20,000 student and credit card debt within the two years. The end of the second year is coming up and not only am I debt free now, but I've managed to save $12,000 as well. I would never have imagined this possible 2 years ago. Next year I plan on hiring an employee to help me, and maybe another 1 or 2 the next year.

For those wanting reference I would recommend skimming that first, for those not wanting to read two posts the **tl;dr:** ""I built my savings but I never built my life"" and I was going to make moves to change that.  

So here we are! I am currently employed part-time working remote for the same company as before, streaming part/fulltime depending on how much I wish to stream said week, well-traveled with more plans in the future, happy, and not caring about money anymore while still diligently saving. Here's my journey for how I got here.

### Part 1 - Planning Change

At the time of writing my first post I was sad but inspired. In the past I checked my accounts weekly if not daily, reworked my budgets/graphs often, but I knew things needed to be different. So at that moment I gave myself an extreme budget to change my life, because nothing is more important than your life and your happiness. That budget was all of my leftover income that year. So I would max my IRA and 401K, and then everything after could be spent on my life and happiness as I saw fit. I had a savings rate of ~75% for the previous 3.5 years so I figured I owed it to myself to take a little break for one year. As I said in my previous post, ""if I'm miserable during the accumulation phase, I'm still going to be miserable afterwards."" So it was worth spending a year of my life trying to fix that.   

The first thing I did was change my life and attack fears/uncomfortable situations. I did this in multiple ways:

* I gave myself the previously stated budget. I had been afraid of spending money and wanted to change that to see if it made a difference.  
* I sent a note out to my friends/acquaintances (about 50 people) as follows

> Hello friend,
> Today is my birthday. For this special year I am looking to broaden my experiences, deepen connections, and to simply be accepting and open to more things.

> What I'm asking from each of you is that you get back to me with one event/occasion/task that you really enjoy or have always wanted to try that we could go do together or with a group.

> This could be something that you do daily, something you do annually, or something you may only want to do once in a lifetime, but whatever it is I want it to be something that you're really passionate about, regardless of whether you think it will interest me or not. I'm open to traveling and hopefully don't have too many limitations with the exceptions of legality and danger/harm.

> If you come up with something just let me know and we can look to get it scheduled within a year. If not no worries!

> Thanks,
> -MrLlamaSC 

* I began ordering at restaurants by saying, ""Please bring me your favorite thing on the menu. Also, please don't tell me what it is. I have no dietary restrictions and will eat anything.""  

### Part 2 - Making Changes

By doing these exercises I was able to force myself into situations by using other people's drive and motivation. Not everyone responded and unfortunately I wasn't able to achieve a 100% success rate in doing every activity, but in the end that didn't matter. I still completed a lot of activities including: Ghost hunting, learning to ski, learning to SCUBA dive and going on a dive trip, roadtripping around Oklahoma (Where I lived), white water rafting, paddleboarding, attending a multi-day music festival, cooking and hosting feasts for friends, learning professional Christmas decorating, and more. From the new foods perspective I ate a large variety of new foods and learned to appreciate different tastes and cultures from this. Additionally, I pushed myself in my own ways. Such as when visiting a cenote in Cancun I forced myself to jump off the highest cliff (~30ft) because it seemed scary. After the first jump it still seemed scary so I went up there and jumped off of it again.  

In the short term these were not instant-happiness fixers. I kept journals where I would write about my experiences and happiness levels and nothing suddenly made me go from unhappy to happy, but the accumulation of them began to change who I was as a person and the average of those levels slowly rose. This also gave me a better understanding of things that I loved in life and things that I didn't care to spend money on.  

To me it felt a bit like dating. I'm not going to fall in love with every girl I date nor am I going to marry every girl, but every girl I've dated has been worth the experience because it helps me figure out something I like/don't like about a partner. Going on these adventures and trying these new things were all great, even if I didn't like the experiences that much, because I learned more about who I am and what I want in life. Spending the money on something that ""wasn't worth it"" was still actually worth the knowledge gained.

An important activity that I want to discuss further is skiing. I had always avoided skiing because it's cold and expensive and I don't like either of those things. So when my friend came to me and said, ""I want you to come ski with us."" I said, ""ehhh I think I'm good."" After a couple of days she followed up with, ""I thought the whole point of this year was to try new experiences and push yourself?"" This hit deep because that was the point of the year and so I changed my mind and forked over about $1,500 to go on this ski trip. Maybe it was lost money, but I needed to at least give it a try.  

I loved it. I loved every bit of it. The challenge, the nature, the beauty. I immediately purchased my own gear and booked additional trips. Skiing became one of the greatest things I had ever done in life and I had almost turned it down. Then I realized for my whole life I had been scared of liking something because it was expensive and I wanted to retire early, without realizing that I could actually like something more than early retirement itself. I never gave future-MrLlamaSC credit that he could make smart decisions such as ""I'll work a few extra months to afford skiing trips in the future."" I was so scared of all lifestyle creep, I shut out life itself.  

### Part 3 - Financial Changes

Now while all of this was going on both of my incomes were actually growing. I got two promotions at work (one of which came about simply from no longer having fear and asking for it) and despite cutting my streaming hours down my streaming revenue was increasing. I also noticed that my positivity and new personality was more attractive and I wasn't just the ""Diablo 2 Guy"" anymore but the ""Positive Diablo 2 Guy."" By the end of the year my expenses had nearly doubled (20K to 36K) but my savings rate had actually gone up. I know some of this would have just come naturally as I got older/continued streaming, but I 100% believe more of the increases came from the adjustments I made to my being.  

But what's even better is I no longer cared. I realized that I'm not an expensive person overall and even without micromanaging my finances in general I still make financially sound decisions. I quit coming to /r/fi daily, I stopped looking at my retirement goal, and I don't even look at my networth or accounts anymore beyond basic accounting or tax time. If you asked me when I crossed a certain milestone I wouldn't be able to tell you. If the market crashed 10% I wouldn't know or care because I've already set everything up to accommodate that. I still love saving money but I don't dedicate my life to it and my happiness doesn't depend on it.  

And the best part of it all is once I had freed myself from this ""Must grind hard and make as much as possible immediately"" mindset, I found the desire to build exactly the life I want. So I went for it. Four months ago I walked up to my boss and said, ""I want to work part-time remote."" This was extremely unheard of at my company and my boss/HR/etc were a bit uncertain about why I would want to take a pay cut and not constantly be pushing to move up another level in the company, but after a couple of months they approved the request. So I packed up my stuff, moved cities, and began the next phase of my life. 

And here I am working from wherever I want remotely three days a week and spending the rest of the time mixing in streaming and life experiences. Saving for the life I've built, but never being afraid to continue building. I am extremely blessed for all of the opportunities I've been given in life and continue to be thankful every day. I am also extremely grateful for this community guiding me to save so much in the previous years. This financial freedom has allowed me a lot of room in exploring life further and has given me the knowledge necessary to not only help myself but others around me as well. Push boundaries, explore the unknown, and take control of your days. **Build the life you want, then save for it.**",financialindependence

Due to the pandemic and economic slowdown, my almost-63 year old father was recently laid off from his engineering firm. He's in good enough financial shape that while, even though he was planning on working until 65, he's probably not going to look too hard for another job. Fortunately my mother has been a public employee nearly her entire career so has a nice pension, and they've generally made solid financial decisions so they'll be fine. My dad also faced pay cuts during the 2008 recession, but did not lose his job at that point.

Watching them go through this experience has pushed me more towards the goal of retiring by the time I'm 60 (or at least have the option). I keep hearing about the struggles people in their 50s and 60s have to find new jobs if laid off, and recessions only make that more difficult. Going through two recessions/economic slowdowns (not sure if we're technically in a ""recession"" yet this time) before I'm 35, I want to do whatever I can to set myself up for security for the future. I'd hate to be 61/62, lose my job and feel forced into a job I hated or not be able to find anything at all.

551,Achieved my dreamed FIRE life...but it was meaningless,,1493,hfmp4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hfmp4w/achieved_my_dreamed_fire_lifebut_it_was/,1593094044.0,"Sharing about my personal life, my past experience from building, selling a company, achieving the life I dreamed about (Financial independency) and how empty it was.


## My lessons learned?
- Look for a meaningful life, always
- but health first
- Time is precious
- Challenges make me alive
- Be happy
- Have savings
- Money is temporary, spend wisely
- B2B business is hard. Relationships help a lot



## Intro
2007 -  I’d been working for 10 years in Brazil, mainly as a software engineer and tech lead for a few different software development agencies.

Hectic environment was the norm. 250+ hours/month for 4 months, no weekends, no exercises. I was like: “I’m young, I can do all of it”.


## Problem
Then, all of the sudden, I felt an irregular heart rate. I felt my heart beating faster for 2 days. This situation led me to a hospital visit. Burnt out detected. I was told to reduce workload. At least, my heart and everything else was completely fine.

***This problem would change my mindset forever.***


## Solution
Worrying about my life, I left the company and planned to spend 1 year taking care of myself, no work at all. (At the time I was living at home, no kids, 2 years of savings, which facilitated my decision)

## My new mindset
- I will never work as many hours as before
- I will not worry about work as much as I will about my health


## What did I do next?
2 months into my “forced sabbatical”. Got a call from a former colleague: a job proposal. “NO, I’ll stay 1 year off work”. “How about doing a contract, working from home, at your own time?” I sent my proposal, considering 8hrs/day, higher rates and extended delivery dates. “Ok, agreed”.

Fast forwarding some years, I co-created a B2B product (similar to QlikView and GeckoBoard) at my own pace (10 months), without pressures (working normal hours). Took us 10 months to strike the first sale!


## Company of One
I ran the company for 9 years:

- 3 co-founders, I was the only one - working full time
- 4 clients only
- 4 employees
- All projects had realistic deadlines. We wouldn't allow pressure from clients to deliver earlier
- No extra hours
- Flexible time, we mostly could work whenever and wherever we wanted to, following the deliverables

All of it also allowed me to work less hours and enjoy the chased freedom. **We were thriving.**


## Finally, the dreamed life
Everything was running accordingly. No long hours. Holidays abroad. Time to exercise. Low 7 figures revenue. Great profit. Highly efficient employees. The dreamed life had arrived! To make it even better, I received an offer and sold my company for something in the north of 7 times my yearly earnings.


## Moving abroad
With money on hand was time for us (my wife and I) to take the biggest decision of our lives: to move abroad, from the hot and sunny Brazil to London (I’ll write another post with the reasons we decided to move).


## I’m on top of the world
Now, I have all the time I wished for. I can travel a lot. I don’t need to work. I’m successful, anything I launch will be profitable. I know how to make money. 

Then I travelled. I didn’t look for a new job at all. I invested my time in side-projects as diverse as a list of transport options from airports to city centres. List of UK beers. List of videogame’s musics.


## Is everything going according to the plan?
Well, my new lifestyle was not bringing me real happiness. **Having anything I dreamed of without any clear purpose was meaningless.**

Adding to this, my side-projects were not helping anyone. **This made me realise I wasn't as invincible as I arrogantly had thought.**


## The meaning of my life
One of the purposes of our moving abroad, was to raise kids in a safer country, with less problematic politics. Then, sticking to the original plan, it was time to have a baby. He was born 2 years after I started my dreamed, empty life.

Since then, I'm one of the most important people in the world, at least for him. My life now has the most clear objectives, most difficult challenges and the best rewards ever: 
- **to make him as happy as possible. If he’s happy, I’m more than happy** 

- **to raise him without any prejudiced views**

- **and many, many more**

**Now, I’m on top of the world.**

## My today’s world
Since 2018 I'm working as a Project Manager/Product Owner after 12 years as an employer. 

Why? My mind needs to be active (empty mind sucks). It makes me feel alive. I need the income. 

There are loads of positive points now, like 25 days of holidays, clear direction, having a boss to learn from, working in an industry I’m passionate about (sports), career progression, etc.

## My future
I’m chasing the dream, once again, of launching something that helps people. Why? 
- to see the real joy of helping people solve their problems
- to spend quality time with my family. This time will never come back
- to have the freedom to work whenever and wherever I’m the most productive
- To feel the rush when a new client buys my product

Now, I’m 100% sure I’m using my time and money way more wisely than before.",financialindependence

Do you conduct yourself as you always have, or has the sense of the leverage winds shifting completely got you in DGAFF mode( the extra F is for flying)?",financialindependence

My dad was the sole earner in the family (a self employed massage therapist). He never had dreams of FIRE but he just knew to always pay with cash, put money away when you can, and invest. In his early 50's, he suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and unable to work. The stoke was completely unexpected as he'd been a lifelong endurance athlete. After the immediate shock settled, my first concern was how he and my mother (who had never worked) could keep going. When I saw that balance, I knew we'd all be ok. I thank him for that gift every time I see him and remind him that he saved our family, even though I can't tell if he understands me or not. Because of that money, he and my mom are still able to live independently, travel to see family, and even support my sister as she goes through life.


&nbsp;



Now I work and budget and save everyday with the hope that I can give that same security to my kids one day. I couldn't care less about RE, I just want to be the same kind of provider my dad was. His foresight prevented a bad situation from becoming a complete disaster and I'll always be thankful for that.

&nbsp;

Sometimes the grind of savings rates, projections, and discipline  can get a little overwhelming when just thinking about quitting my job a few years early. I mean, why don't I deserve a quick trip to the Bahamas? For those days that RE just isnt enough to keep you on track, maybe this can help. I know it helps me.

Just wanted to share my good news with people who would appreciate it.  It's been a bit of a journey but not so difficult.  My husband and I embarked on this in earnest about 5 years ago.  We were always both pretty smart with our money and started putting money into investments and RRSP's on our own before we even started dating.

We basically followed the general guidelines outlined here, in the FAQ's, and Mr. money moustache, amongst other research.  We spent less than 50% of our incomes, maxed out RRSP matching plans, maxed out TFSA's, made sure to rebalance portfolios on the regular, and invested primarily in index linked funds.

Yesterday I put my resignation in at work. It's been interesting seeing the responses from people who generally seem in disbelief. When they find out I'm leaving the first question is always, ""Where are you going?""  When I tell them I'm retiring most are having a hard time understanding, but that's okay.  I have to explain I'm retiring from the rat race, but that doesn't mean I won't work in the future, I just don't HAVE to.

This is so crazy...I have butterflies.  I haven't been unemployed since I was 14 so this is going to be a big transition.  All the best to those of you who are there or working on it :)",financialindependence

557,Milestone: My First 100 Grand,,1480,8o0mw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8o0mw1/milestone_my_first_100_grand/,1527947113.0,"I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time, and I love reading everyone's stories about how they got on their FIRE path, so I thought I would share my own, even though my net worth is pretty moderate by many standards.

I am 31 years old, and have just made it to my first $100,000.

I grew up with great parents, but from early on I could see how debt affected their lives.  My mom had a six figure job and my dad mostly didn't work.  Mom supported Dad financially, especially his gambling habits, which took a big chunk out of any hopes for retirement she had.  Mom is now 64 and still working full time.  The law firm that she dedicated 30 years of her life to fired her during the 2009 recession.  Mom never paid off the house, instead taking out a second mortgage after she got canned.  In short, my parents have always spent any money they earned rather than saving it.

I was able to go to college for free due to scholarships and some financial help from my grandma.  I worked at the financial aid office as a work study during my time there.  Every day I would watch 18 year olds sign their lives away for unsubsidized student loans.  Most kids didn't even want to know the difference between subsidized or unsubsidized; they only wanted to know how much they qualified for.  I made excellent grades and made it out of college debt free, but with a useless Bachelor of Science in Religious Studies.  Not a great choice on my part, but live and learn.  My first full time job after I graduated was as a cashier at a grocery store.  I abhored every minute of it.  The plan after graduating was to teach English overseas, but by this time, I was married to a man I had met while in college. He had been going to classes for seven years and still hadn't graduated.

My husband worked at a local video game store owned by our friend who was having to file bankruptcy.  By combining our life savings, money I had inherited from my grandpa, and two loans we took out from my grandma and his grandma, we bought the video game store.  We really turned that place around, and we worked our asses off to pay back our loans.  After just six months of ownership, our business was in the black.  For the first time in our lives, we were making real money, and it felt amazing.  We found a great deal on a house and paid for it in cash.  By 27 years old, I had done what my parents could not: paid off the house.  It felt great.

Even though finances were good, managing the businesses weighed heavy on our marriage.  We even opened up two more stores.  But the stress combined with our own personal problems swelled and blew up in our faces.  We divorced, and my husband took the house and the businesses.  I took $50,000 and put it in mutual funds then went on a six month long hike.  This was first time since I was 17 years old that I didn't have a job.  The feeling of having a basically six month vacation was intoxicating.  Try it: it will ruin you to figure out how to retire as soon as possible.  The hike also taught me that I don't need much at all materially to be happy.  Just living with what I could carry in my backpack was plenty enough to make me content.

Since the hike, I have been living a much different life than when I owned the businesses.  My jobs have been low stress and low pay, but the money I put into investments has grown to $80,000.  On top of that, my grandma left me an inheritance of $20,000.  So, sooner than I expected, I have no debt and a net worth of $100,000.  My grandma made most of her money through real estate, and I have thought about buying another fixer upper in cash, both as an investment and a way of honoring her.  Even if I don't, I will continue to reinvest my capital gains and dividends.  

Anyway, I don't talk to my family or friends about how much money I have, and it felt good writing it all down.  Thanks everybody and best wishes on your endeavors.  I admire you people!

TLDR: Saved money through frugality, owning business, luck, and help from family. Feels good.",financialindependence

559,[meta] downsides of the 'Daily FI discussion thread' model,,1473,f6frqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f6frqe/meta_downsides_of_the_daily_fi_discussion_thread/,1582139995.0,"Hello all,

I've noticed that despite having over 700,000 readers, this sub only gets about 5-8 posts per day—an extremely low rate of posting for how many people are here.

Instead, virtually all discussion gets locked up in the daily discussion threads, which tend to get about 700 to 1000 comments each.

I feel this makes it very difficult to browse, as the daily thread post titles indicate nothing about what's in the comments. It also makes search almost totally useless, as reddit's search only looks at submissions, not comments.

In other words, this is a poor way to organize content. The stated purpose of daily threads is for anything that 'doesn't warrant its own post', but that has resulted in the vast majority of all discussion getting clumped into a few posts—even hundreds of topics that *could* warrant their own threads, but are instead buried in a vast ocean of comments on a single post.

For example on today's daily thread, there was an interesting string of comment asking about Traditional vs Roth TSPs. But guess what? That sub-thread is going to be completely undiscoverable in the future (at least using reddit search).

Suggested alternatives:

* Loosen, in some way, what qualifies for its own thread
* Choose weekly discussion topics to help group comments around a certain topic together.
* Along with the previous bullet, a meta thread could be maintained to help the community brainstorm topics they'd like to see discussed.",financialindependence
560,How does it feel to have two commas? My Thanks,,1471,k1d0gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k1d0gp/how_does_it_feel_to_have_two_commas_my_thanks/,1606386912.0,"Today I woke up with something to definitely be thankful for. I saw that I officially became a member of the two comma (or dot/space) club. How does it feel? To be honest, it feels exactly the same as it did when my NW still had one comma. 

I don’t make six or seven figures. I don’t have any crypto. Not a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or other high earner. I still make a five figure base salary as I did when I got my first “real paying” job.  For the curious, mostly admin office stuff, new media, and resource mgmt).  20s underemployed and drowning in med bills, yada, yada, yada.

My allocation is approx. 34%ish 401k, 52%ish 3 fund brokerage (VTSAX, VBTLX, VTIAX), 12%ish jumbo CD, and the rest in cash. 

My tastes and hobbies are still the same. Still have bills to pay. Still appreciate the same things: peace of mind, friends and family, cooking and eating, and enjoying new people, places, and experiences.

I don’t fully subscribe to some of the FI beliefs I see in the sub like the remaining in a particular paying job despite the high levels of job dissatisfaction and the constant questions of how one would fill their time if not working. I am ok with my job, and have plenty of outside hobbies and interests to keep me busy. In fact, I am still planning a leave of absence soon to be able to spend more time with family and in my causes. Pandemic be darned. 

All said, I still have a ways to go in reaching my goals though.

Here are things I wish I knew earlier in this journey:

Start saving and investing as early as you can. Really, as early as you can. Compounding is no joke. When I got my first real job offer, I did not sign up for 401k deductions. I now see that as a mistake. Three years and a few more jobs and unemployment periods later, I signed up for the max deductions in my new job and have been maxing it out in my jobs since. 

Don’t be afraid of a little risk.  A month after my first 401k deduction, I saw my balance declining. I freaked out and moved my money into a safer fund (but did not reduce my contributions). The money later recovered with the market and then some. This pattern would repeat over the years. Now I know that this is normal, and that we need to be in it for the long haul.

Speaking of risk, after discovering this sub three years ago I decided to open a brokerage account and slowly dump my money in there. Lots more fluctuations than my 401k but I stayed in. Good move clearly. I now see I had nothing to fear in opening an account. 

Take care of your health. Medical bills are killer.  I spent my 20s underemployed and broke, plus drowning in 10s of thousands of dollars of medical bills. The collectors are simply vicious. It took me years just to get to 0. Taking care of your health also puts you in a position to maximize work opportunities.  For one of my temp jobs it required a special physical to make sure I could handle the job.  If I failed that due to bad health, I’d not be where I am today. 

Be open minded and adventurous. I have taken jobs in the past 10 years that have come my way completely by surprise. Like that one I mentioned about the special physical. All were amazing experiences. While some I would not do again, I appreciate the experience and memories I got from them. 

Know your limits and when to stop. I have quit a few jobs too over bad bosses, bad and toxic working conditions, and when I saw the job weighing on my health. No job is worth your life. Be prepared to walk away for yourself and family if need be.

Frugal is ok. This is me. I have always been frugal. Growing up living in the projects had a part in that. But also I don’t put a lot of stock in collecting material things. I like doing things with people, from walking around together to home cooking together. These cost much less than other things. 

Value and focus on experiences and people over money and possessions. Nuff said. 

That’s my very long story in a nutshell. I may update as needed.",financialindependence

I see it all over the place but I always expect better from this community and I'm always disappointed to see so much negativity towards the success of others. 

First off, nobody is ever ""lucky"" or ""fortunate"" to lose a parent. I don't care if that parent leaves you $1 or $1m. And I don't think it even matters if you're trying to say, ""Well I'm not saying they're lucky from a life side but from a financial side it's pretty fortunate."" This isn't just some ficticious situation, this is a real person. Think about walking up to someone in real life who lost a parent and going, ""Hey that sucks, but you got $250K so really you got lucky there."" I pray you wouldn't ever say that, and if you would you might want to reconsider your relationship with money because it's unhealthy.  

In the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a65lb4/36m_2m_last_day_of_work_today_lessons_learned/) I'm referencing it's almost sad how much the OP feels the need to talk down his accomplishments and attribute everything to luck just so he doesn't get lambasted by the community.  

We see it happen in so many situations though.   

* ""Athletes are lucky because they were born athletic. Anybody with their height/talent could achieve that success. So lucky.""  
* ""Musicians are lucky to be born with perfect pitch or just got lucky they were discovered.""  
* ""People in the FI community are lucky they have high paying jobs or don't have all these expenses I have.""  
* Successful Twitch streamers are lucky they started when there weren't lots of people streaming/they have connections I can't have/probably just got big hosts that kicked them off.""  

It's rubbish. First off, yes life isn't fair. It's true! Some people start with more talent or money or simply different situations. And a life of total equality and fairness would actually suck because nobody would ever be different. I love the short story ""Harrison Bergeron"" for showing a world of true ""equality.""  

Additionally though, it's just purely making (usually incorrect) assumptions about a situation you know very little about. Top athletes spend every day working out/eating right/studying techniques. Musicians grind away practicing and studying. Many times they also have to figure out the best ways to market themselves to be noticed. I don't consider someone who got famous by posting their singing on Youtube lucky, I consider them smart. They made the decision to put their content up there (and probably a lot of other places too) and it paid off. People here in the FI community have spent a lot of hours researching, learning skills like budgeting, sacrificing lots of monetary expenses and material goods, all so we can FIRE. Yet anytime you read a news article about FI all you see is people in the comments making excuses about how lucky we are and they could do the same thing if they had our luck.  

And are we lucky? Sure. Are all of those people unluckier than us? Probably not. Some might be, but I'm sure plenty of them could very well put themselves into FIRE situations if they really dedicated the time, effort, and sacrifice that we have into this lifestyle. And it's insulting to us when they make those assumptions and claim ""luck"" for so much they don't understand.   

In regards to the previous post, the guy joined a start up that was eventually acquired and then eventually went public, leading to some nice windfalls. How quickly were so many to disregard everything except the end result. I doubt he simply just joined any random start ups without any thought. I'm sure there was a lot of research into what the company was about, what it made, and I'm sure he calculated a ""chance to succeed.""  
Maybe you joined one and it didn't work out for you because you got unlucky or your calculated risk didn't pay off, maybe he is just more talented than you at determining successful startups from ones that will most likely fail (Which I think is the hardest thing to admit: Recognizing someone might just be better than you at something), or maybe he is so skilled and talented that a lot of the work he put in (sometimes up to 90 hrs/week) actually made a big enough difference to lead to this success. We don't know. We can't ever know. There are way too many factors in play here. So why must we instead pretend like we know everything? And why must we care so much? Putting down his success isn't going to lead to you being anymore successful, it's just going to create negativity and probably be detrimental in the long run since a negative attitude can definitely impact your own success. 

We all are on our own unique journey through life. I have advantages you don't have, you have advantages I don't have, and we all have advantages many people in this world don't have such as being able to simply read this post on the internet...or even read at all. But there is no leaderboard in life nor is there any true end goal for all. In the end just do what makes you happy and try to live your best life, taking advantage of everything you have at your disposal (so long as you're not stepping on others to attain it).",financialindependence

I work in primary care which is preventative health and management of chronic conditions, as well as gatekeeping to other specialities.

This is a combination of finding and treating bullshit unavoidable stuff (cancer, accidents, weird viruses, autoimmune disease) but the bulk of practice is treating diseases of lifestyle with expensive pills and surgery.

The consequences of obesity:

The classic overweight 50 year old guy will require:

Pills for diabetes. 200-800 dollars a month. Pills for gerd. Sleep study and cpap machine for apnea. Cholesterol medication. Joint replacement at 60 or so for 40k. Blood pressure meds add another 50 dollars or so. Eventually your back will probably suffer and you may end up in pain management as well. 20 percent or more of patients with all the above will have a major cardiovascular event (thousands of dollars) despite all my best efforts. Without a doctors efforts these diseases will slowly take their toll by your mid 50s usually if they've been chronic.

Add in smoking:
 Inhalers for copd 1-200 a month. Extra cardiovascular disease. Strokes, heart attacks, clogged arteries to your major limbs. Eventually oxygen. Once you hit 6 liters you can no longer use airplanes or trains to travel. Many cancers can cost hundreds of thousands to treat. 

Stress:
I treat dozens of people for job related anxiety. It feels wrong, but they cant quit because of their choices earlier in life. This affects sleep, appetite, relationships. They end up on pills to maintain their lifestyles.


Do not neglect your health on the path to FIRE. The bulk of my job is treating lifestyles with pills. I always push the alternative but most don't take it. I charge a lot of money to do that, and the drug companies charge a lot more. 

Don't smoke. Dont drink too much. Dont get fat. If you're fat, get unfat while you're still healthy enough to do it. Take care of your mental health. See a doctor once a year once you're 30 or so they can head off some of the preventable bullshit. This will save you tens of thousands of dollars.

I am visual guy, not a numbers guy, so they really help me understand things in a way that my spreadsheet does not.

These calcs all have slightly different approaches, but here's a list of ones I like and why:

This is the one I use the most, that I compare all the others to.  I don't like how the inputs are on different pages, but I like the graphic output, which is easy to understand.

[https://firecalc.com/](https://firecalc.com/)

This one is interesting because it includes actuarial information about death rates.  So, yeah, I have a 3% chance of running out of money at age 85, but I have a 30% chance of being dead, so 3% doesn't look that bad in comparison.

[https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/)

I like this one because it allows you to set a goal for how much you want left over.  Some of the calcs will show you 100% success if you end up with 1 dollar at age 100.  This one lets you set how how much nest egg you want left over for your kids.  (Or your cats.  Let's be honest.)

[https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator](https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator)

This one shows your nest egg in terms of how many days per year of freedom it will buy you. So if you have 500,000k saved and plan on spending 75k a year, your nest egg will pay for 97 days of freedom per year in retirement. That's kinda cool.

[https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/](https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/)

This one lets you show the effects of various rates of inflation which I don't see in other calcs.  I just don't like the graphic it produces as well as the other calcs.[http://www.cfiresim.com/](http://www.cfiresim.com/)  EDIT: Updated link from limpingrobot

This one differentiates between standard, tax deferred and Roth accounts to help you plan your withdrawals better.

This one it has sliders for some of the inputs which are fiddly, and you need to specify different income streams at the bottom.  On the plus side, it has room for spouse income and is very clear and interesting graphically.

[jrjjr](https://www.reddit.com/user/jrjjr/) (Creator of nesteggly) also suggests FICalc.  It has different withdrawal strategies, and lets you export or share your results. For historical data, it shows which start years would have  succeeded or failed for your portfolio.

569,UPDATE: FIRE ≠ Happiness. 1 year into FIRE and miserable. Spending next 30 days trying to live my 'dream' fire life,,1438,ezancn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ezancn/update_fire_happiness_1_year_into_fire_and/,1580914289.0,"UPDATE: 

Hello hello!

So I wrote this [post back in November](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dq7kev/fire_happiness_1_year_into_fire_and_miserable/).

Tl;dr of the post: I wasn’t happy with FIRE, so I set lofty goals of all the things I wanted to do/change about my life and posted to Reddit. The original post blew up way more than I expected and I got some incredible feedback (some good and some bad)

Here’s my update post to see how my experiment went and where I am today. Happy to answer more in comments too.

**Summary**

**The good**

* Started dating someone. Did some great traveling. 
* Discovered a great insight. Most of the items that I did e.g. Gym, writing, meditation, etc. didn’t feel good in the moment. I also didn’t feel that great afterwards. There was no ‘workout’ high, I didn’t feel more relaxed after I meditated, etc. HOWEVER, the interesting part is whenever I reflected back on those days, they were almost always better. My takeaway being that even if it doesn’t ‘feel’ better, doing those mind/body wellness exercises do make a difference. YMMV.
* I started consulting for my friends company. This was a huge win for me since it was part time, paid well, and actually led me to work on a really fun project. She built a great business but started scaling too fast and her whole company was basically on Google Spreadsheets. I migrated her to airtable and rebuilt her processes. It was great to put my skills to work, even if it was a rather small project. BUT another fun thing came out of it was there was an opportunity! Currently, there's no ability to invoice inside of Airtable! ~~So I built~~  I ideated, wireframed, and speced' custom software so if you have airtable, you can connect with stripe to charge, itemize invoice, and track all of it to airtable. I had a blast building this (teaming up with an engineer, I'm not a coder). I'm currently working on finishing up the beta and putting it into a SaaS in the next month or two. Maybe it’ll generate 0 dollars, maybe it’ll generate 6 figures, who knows but it was fun to scratch my own itch. 
* A forbes article was written about me from the original reddit post 
* A lot of people reached out to tell me they were in the same situation which really made me feel connected to the world in some strange way. 
* A lot of people asking about partnering up (which was flattering)
* Helped a couple people with some basic advice on their startups
* Got a LOT of inbound messages about how they were in the same place which was incredibly comforting. A lot of times when you're

**Bad**

* Boredom strikes: I downloaded instagram again and started redditing again (I detoxed myself on both). I've found i've been spending a lot more time on both, especially in the mornings not getting out of bed. This is probably the biggest drag to my day. It makes me feel I’m wasting a lot of time
* I didn’t finish my goal of 30 days working out, meditation, etc. I knew it was going to be hard because I was traveling and I still didn’t prepare well enough. This is a good opportunity for improvement.
* I generated a lot of ideas but I still don’t have something I want to devote 100% of my time to. 
* Still hard to give myself permission to not be working 24/7. 

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned:**

* I was thrown into the deep end with RE. Definitily FI is of course a worthy goal. I continue to remind myself how lucky I am that I'm in this position. That said, I give myself permission to allow myself to not be content during the moment. But I can't stay in that space too long. I need to reframe as grateful while allowing myself space to not always be vontent. This has helped.
* Have faith in the universe that it'll work out. This is a hard one and I think important. When I felt 'stuck' it felt like there was no way out. Reframing in faith that it'll work out, would've made it easier for me to get out of the hole in the first place. Being scared of the hole just makes the hole deeper. Sometimes that fear is 80% of the hole that you're in. It was for me.
* I've done a better job figuring out what motivates me. When I reflect on why my friends project is fun for me, I've identified the following reasons:
   * I'm helping my friend get out of spreadsheets and operate in a scalable way. Her business is now operating 2x better. In other words, **I love adding value.** Kind of obvious when you write it, but it wasn't so obvious for me.
   * I'm being mentally challenged
   * I'm solving problems that are hard and even though I don't know the solution, I know I can get there. I think that's pretty fun (although probably not sustainable in all projects)
* Empathy — when reading my post a significant amount of people said the same thing, you should be happy, or you are clearly missing something else in your life. Honestly, if i had read my post, i would've said the same thing. I clearly pictured me saying the same exact thing with the feeling that I know exavtly what the other person needs. I realized, that thought process doesn't serve me. There were a lot of people who (understandly) jumped to conclusions and thought they knew the situation. I'm not sure how I can retain this insight of not judging too fast or being empathetic moving forward but it was a good lesson.

Overall, I think my experiment was a success in that I wrote down what I wanted and got what I needed. On the flipside, there's so much more I can do. The biggest WOW for me is that I wrote intentions down and real change happened. **Setting intention AND taking action is a meaningful way to make change.**

I'm thinking I should start another experiment to get more results.

tl-dr; did a 1 month experiment and results turned out way above my expectations. Learned a lot. Still room for imporvement. Looking forward to doing a similar experiment. 

Hope this was helpful/interesting! Happy to answer any other questions

570,I teach a class about money and investment to first year college students. What should they learn?,,1439,hsx8s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hsx8s4/i_teach_a_class_about_money_and_investment_to/,1594998264.0,"Here is what I cover in the course.

* Visualizing the life you want
* Delayed gratification
* Savings plan as a % of income
* Compound interest
* Stocks/Index funds
* Retirement accounts
* Employer matching
* When buying a house makes sense
* FIRE

What else should I teach these 18 year old college students about money, investment, finance or wealth?

EDIT:  Lot of people are mentioning great things.  I will compile them in a list here soon.  Thanks!  


Okay, folks had a lot to say, but here are the topics that were repeated most often that I think would fit in with what I am already teaching in the course:  


Credit/credit cards/credit scores/good debt vs bad debt  


Student loans. Some suggested to take no more than 1 years salary.  


Emotional reactions to money (people borrowing money, sunk cost fallacy, keeping up with the Joneses, etc.)  


Taxes/tax brackets

571,"Is CNBC trying to sell being poor to Millenials? ""Living On $60K A Year In NYC — Millennial Money""",,1431,btvbc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/btvbc0/is_cnbc_trying_to_sell_being_poor_to_millenials/,1559015238.0,"I checked out [this recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEQbpmqyVEk) out hoping that it would shed some light on how someone could be financially stable and growing their wealth *outside of the current week-to-week survival lifestyle.* Instead, it highlights a 32 year old waitress who makes $50-55k waitressing and $5k dancing who has no retirement savings with no plan to, shares a place with two roommates, has $5k in savings with what seems like no idea that she is losing more and more potential wealth every day of her life.

Now, don't get me wrong, people can and should live however they damn well please, but I was saddened that CNBC was selling *this* to millennials as a way of life instead of accumulating wealth to say, buy a house or retire before 65 anywhere else but in the middle of Kansas. And kids? Forget about it.

I'm frustrated that this is what my genertaion is reduced to - being happy about being ignorant poor. Thinking it's OK to strive for this woman's lifestyle while thinking ""this can't be right, right?"" in the back of our minds. All the while, the rich stay richer and the ignorant stay ignorant.

This hit me personally because I grew up blue collar and I know most of my old friends and family would be super happy to see this video, but they'd have no idea what they're missing or why.",financialindependence
572,Reached FIRE goal last year...I’ve learned the fun part was working towards it.,,1419,hng0z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hng0z2/reached_fire_goal_last_yearive_learned_the_fun/,1594210701.0,"Pretty self explanatory from the title.  this is truly  a classic instance of “enjoy the journey” on display here.    It was a lot of fun working and strategizing how to get to it than sitting on it, but I also would have done some things differently had I known it’s pretty anti climatic once you reach it. 

Lessons learned and advice:

-Let yourself have small luxuries along the way.  Scrimping and saving is great of course, but you also need to practice spending (believe me, I know this sounds ridiculous but I didn’t practice spending and now have analysis paralysis about buying a $1.50 shirt at Goodwill.  Really.  this is a real example from last week). 

-cherish and celebrate each milestone leading up to your ultimate FIRE number.  these are just as exciting, if not more, because you are slowly proving to yourself you are able to do this.  that thrill of the first $100k, $500k, etc. is important and will feel quaint and cozy looking back on it, so make it a memory worth remembering.  

-Never, never, NEVER put your work above your relationships.  I made this mistake.  It hurt my relationship.  I did this 4 years ago and am still repairing the damage.  If your job is causing so much stress that you can’t sleep or it’s all you think about, seriously consider how to responsibly down shift and then DO IT.  Don’t let a desire to maximize your income destroy the unquantifiable good things in your life for the sake of hitting your number sooner.  

-physical and mental health are also more important than your FIRE timeline.  I learned this the hard way and now will live the rest of my life with a small work-related injury I got by ignoring cues from my body to slow down and rest.  I regret this deeply—don’t make the same mistake.  Prioritize your health over impressing your boss, getting that promotion. building a go-getter reputation—whatever it is, I promise you it won’t matter as much the rest of your life as having an intact and functioning physical self / mind.",financialindependence

My job's contract is ending this year, so I decided to retire in my mid 40's on Jan 2021. I have 2.8mil net worth, of which 2.5 mill is in investments. I plan to control my AGI to be 50k per year, but my family lives off of less than 40k normally. I'll be using a Roth conversion ladder to live off my IRA and taxable investments.

I'm being offered a severance package of 100k all paid in 2021. Unfortunately, the company doesn't allow me to make any 401k contributions with the severance. I plan on putting 12k into deductible IRAs to lower my AGI, so with a family of 5 that leaves me owing 2.2k in Fed and 4.8k in State taxes. Since I don't need that whole 100k, is there any other strategy to lower that AGI that I may be missing?

Would you finance wizards have any advice on dealing with the package? Also any advice on dealing with HR on this would be appreciated.

Here's my investment values the last 10 years for those interested. I did not start tracking it well till recently:

2010 - $486k

2011 - $608k

2012 - $750k - $102k gains.

2013 - $1.021m - $205k gains.

2014 - $1.209m - $145k gains.

2015 - $1.312m - $42k gains.

2016 - $1.567m - $191k gains.

2017 - $1.885m - $297k gains.

2018 - $1.862m - $90k loss.

2019 - $2.392m - $506k gains.

2020 - $2.430m

I made many mistakes this pandemic. Leave your money alone and let it ride lol. I have about 20% in cash but I plan to keep it that way.

Healthcare is another concern.  I plan on going with the cheapest bronze plan for $9 a month and roll the dice that no one gets sick year 1.  Year 2 we’ll be covered better.

He worked extremely hard and built his own construction business. We always had everything we needed but drove inexpensive cars and never had anything too extravagant. When my dad was about 44 he decided that he reached ""his number"" and got out of construction and sold all of his real estate 6 months before the crash in 2008. I was 14 at the time and thought it was strange that other dads weren't retired and able to spend time with their families. My parents were always at all of my sporting events and it was great always having them available. The one thing I do remember is he always struggled when people asked ""what do you do?"" I never realized how rare it was until I was a bit older.

My dad is now 60 and has quadrupled his net worth without really even trying through the stock market (mainly ETF's and a few mutual funds). His lifestyle is pretty much the same as when he had nothing but we have gotten him to lighten up and enjoy things a bit more in life. He focuses his time and effort on his health and volunteering which is fulfilling. He has zero regrets about his decision to retire early and attributes his health to lack of stress.

My wife and I are extremely fortunate and have a pretty high NW for our age and have found balance between spending money on things we value (vacations, etc) but still being smart about how we spend.

I just wanted to share because he is 15+ years into his journey and has zero regret about retiring early. Also, I thought the perspective from when I was a kid would be an interesting take on those with a family! 

Kudos to everyone who is on this awesome journey!",financialindependence
575,Lessons Learned from a 9-month break,,1407,a5nue9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a5nue9/lessons_learned_from_a_9month_break/,1544658625.0,"At the end of March 2018, I said goodbye to my coworkers and the only company of my professional career. My goal was to coast to FI off the $200k I'd already saved up and live happily ever after with my boyfriend. 

Funny how life ends up sometimes, because it didn't happen at all like I thought it would. My freelancing career suffered from a lack of structure and motivation as my relationship with my then boyfriend fell apart. I realized in October that whole plan wasn't going to work and cut my losses. I had a choice between staying with friends in Texas or going home to my parents. As the holidays were approaching (and my mom had recently had a stroke), I went home and lived in my parent's basement for a month until I got my life sorted out. 

I will be going back to work shortly after being out of the corporate world for 9 months. Here are some lessons I learned along the way:

1. Just because you have a plan doesn't mean it's one that's suitable for you. My plan was coastFI while freelancing and it turns out I hated that life. 
2. Take a practice run at FIRE (whatever aspect you choose). Even though things didn't work out like I thought they would, I'm so grateful I took the chance. I learned so much about myself and life. My plan needs adjusting now after I learned I probably won't make much money sidehustling and I like not worrying about a budget. 
3. Things take time. I started job hunting in July semi-seriously and really ramped it up in October. I'm in IT in a pretty niche support role and it took a lot longer than I thought to get back to work. 
4. Be picky. I had several offers that were ok, but I'm glad I was able to wait until a really amazing offer came my way. The only reason I was able to wait is because I wasn't super pressed for money. 
5. Have more cash or easily accessible funds than you think you'll need. I left work with $25k in easy to access money and it wasn't enough. (especially with a stupid expensive rental property to mismanage). Nothing is as stressful to me as scraping the bottom of my checking and savings accounts. Cash is king. 
6. Be willing to invest in yourself. I paid a former IT recruiter $100 to revamp my resume and offer suggestions on my LinkedIn profile. My new employer commented how much they liked my resume. It was the best investment I've ever made in myself. That $100 scored me a job paying roughly 6 figures and I'm not sure I would've gotten an interview without the revamped resume. 

I realize this all doesn't apply to the FIRE process but with any luck y'all will take this with the spirit that it's intended (learn from my experience!) rather than call me stupid for ""trying to retire on $200k at 28"" lol. Any questions or clarifications needed I'll answer in the comments. ",financialindependence
576,Life throws curveballs. Save your money.,,1409,bdpsnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bdpsnt/life_throws_curveballs_save_your_money/,1555389578.0,"I know there's no shortage of posts like this, but I wanted to share my story as I'm the [squiggly success chart](https://images.app.goo.gl/ahJeqgA3tkyRqg7RA) and not the 4M networth 35y/o engineer (sorry for the stereotypes). 

Cliff notes on my background: 30 years old, been part of 5 layoffs and laid off in 4 of them, (willingly) took a pay cut at my most recent job for the growth and learning opportunities, live in a HCOL area, and have a decent amount of medical expenses. 

In the last 3 weeks, there have been so many things that would have sent me panicking just a few years ago or been things I wouldn't have dealt with properly, if at all. 

**Exhibit A**: My dog ended up severely injured three weeks ago, to the point that I had to rush him to the emergency vet. X-rays and meds cost $1,000. Didn't bat an eyelash and was just extremely grateful to have my dog alive. Old me would have (embarrasslingly) tried other alternatives before rushing to the vet or asked for other (cheaper) testing. Vet said emergency x-rays, I said go. 

**Exhibit B**: Just a few days later, I left for a $1,500 vacation I booked nearly 6mo before that. Old me would have gone to the ends of the earth to cancel that trip to ""compensate"" for the vet expenses. I went and tried my best to enjoy every second. 

**Exhibit C**: My grandma just passed away unexpectedly, and I need to get to middle-of-nowhere Europe in less than a week. Flights are INSANE. I've been stalking them all day and they're just getting down to something reasonable, and by ""reasonable"" I mean *more than double* what I've ever spent on them. This is a horrific situation, and I need to be with my family. I'm so grateful that cost is not an issue. 

I am by no means as rich as some of the folks who post here, but good god am I grateful that I was raised to save my money and spend it thoughtfully. The past few weeks would have gone much differently otherwise, or they wouldn't have but I'd be saddled with debt for the next 5 years. 

I know I'm preaching to the choir, but regardless of how ""bumpy"" your journey has been, you're still ahead of the curve if you're paying attention to your finances at all. I don't consider myself wealthy, but in my head I define it as being able to take care of things like this without second thought. 

This spending would certainly not be sustainable for me long-term, but I'm hoping life lightens up. In the meantime, I'm thankful to have been able to take care of everything that has come my way. My parents did well. (I'm the product of insanely hard-working immigrants and watched the ""American dream"" growing up. My dad took me to open my first bank account with just a couple bucks before I could see over the counter!)",financialindependence
577,"I just got laid off today but I feel fine - Still have a long way to go for FIRE but want to share some thoughts (34M, Married no kid, 500K NW, career ladder)",,1407,e8lh9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/e8lh9v/i_just_got_laid_off_today_but_i_feel_fine_still/,1575950870.0,"Quick Facts -

* I just got laid off today; 34M 30F married no kid
* Joint net worth = USD 500k (combined with cash, 401k retirement, vanguard accounts, and 3 rental properties to provide 3k cashflow/month, net)
* Working in a bank in HCOL city - the job I absolutely hate but paid well (100K); I want to switch my career.
* Wife works and loves her job. She makes 100k per year.
* We are frugal and have some side gigs making another 40k which covers 80% of our expenses.
* I received a severance package of 6 months' salary.

Today is unique. I never thought that I will get laid off one day but this just happened. At 2 pm, I received a call from my director and was told to stop by his office. When I opened his door, I saw him and HR. I immediately knew what about to happen. They told me that due to market performance and some other bullshit, they decided to eliminate my role. (Well, I later found out that they actually eliminated the entire team, including my boss.) Then the HR walked me through the severance package - I received an additional 6 months of salary.

When everything was over, I calmly walked out of the building and called my wife. As I expected, she wasn't too surprised. She knew how much I disliked my job every morning and was edgy to quit in a few months. Financially I know that we will be fine. Since the first day of my professional life, I have been working very hard for FIRE. As of today, our net worth is 500k USD with healthy cash flow. We owned 3 rental properties in other areas which bring us 3k per month. Plus we have some side gigs going on (e.g. eBay) which can cover the majority of our daily expenses. With that being said, we saved about 8k - 10k every month.

**Some thoughts -** If this thing happened to me 4 years ago, I would definitely shit my pants. But now, I think it is a great opportunity for me to step away from the career I absolutely hate. I think it is quite interesting that people talk a lot about climbing the career ladder. I think it is also important to find the ladder you like then climb it. Blindly climbing a ladder is wasting your time and will make you miserable day by day. I plan to take some classes to learn something I really like and get ready to switch career. I need to find the ladder I like before climbing.

**Thanks To this Sub -** I discovered this subreddit in 2016 when my previous company was firing people left and right. I was threatened by management and worked my butt off to avoid being fired. I was so scared and I cannot sleep. When the storm was over, I told myself that I will never experience that feeling again. Then I started to save aggressively and started to get into rental properties. I also learned the 4% rule from this sub and started to put money into VTSAX. I cannot have this FIRE mindset without you guys. So Thank you!

**What's next? -** Still undecided but I want to take a break for few weeks. I know I cannot fire right now and still have a long way to go. But I have some side projects going on but really didn't have time to proceed. Now I can really get started and forget about passive-aggressive coworkers, the commute, and useless meetings/deliverables/deadlines.

Have to make some clarifications below as I saw some repeating questions - 

1. Wife is a SWE working for a small tech company;
2. The 3 rental properties are NOT in HCOL. They are few hours away but we are still managing them by ourselves. I started to buy them since 2016, my FIRE ah-ha moment. I was 30 and got serious about saving and investing. 
3. Interesting point - Numbers of coworkers called and texted me; some of them are my good friends and really care about my financial being and career development. I cannot give them the whole picture and just simply told them that I will be fine and want to take a break. 
4. It is quite incredible to have 1.3k upvotes and hundreds of comments after only 24 hours. My wife and I read them together and put smiles on our faces. :) I feel so fortunate to join this sub and can share my journey with you guys. Regardless of your age and financial stage, start pursuing FIRE today! It is a start to set yourself free! and I am sure you will reach your FIRE. Let us work together :D",financialindependence
578,"I shared this last year and people seem to like it so for those interested in keeping track of their finances in 2020, here's the spreadsheet I use (In Google Sheets form. Link in comments)",,1403,ehq7oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ehq7oh/i_shared_this_last_year_and_people_seem_to_like/,1577732009.0,"Hi guys, I shared this sheet a few times on here so wanted to help out again if anyone is interested. I made it a Google Sheets for easy access:

Here's the link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3rKOXwdgX1yaz0xPH9k2S4OzEKljZZo/view?usp=sharing

To copy to your own drive go to File > Make a Copy... Then it's all yours to use.

Notes on how to use the Sheet:

Each Row denotes a day, to keep track daily. I find it best to do that. I keep my receipts and/or check my bank account, and at the end of the day I quickly add up the total for each category and put it in the correct cell (I also write a comment for each cell so I can remember what it was that I did with that money. ex: if I go out to lunch and dinner I add both totals in the Dinning cell for that day (=5.54+25) and then in the comment I write: Breakfast at Barney's LTD., Lunch at Slater's). I added more categories this year for more detailed tracking. Some are obvious but some others are more customized for me (such as Transit and Travel since I am a digital nomad so Travel is between-countries transport (flight/trains), and Transit is local transport (uber, trams, etc.). you may change these columns to fit your needs as you wish.

Columns O and P are the monthly Totals for each category. Halves breaks the month into 2 from the 1st to the 15, and from the 15th to the end of the month).

The Initial row in column V to AA are there to put the amount of money in your Checking and Savings accounts and amount invested (Excluding gains) that you have the morning of the 1st (take into account the money that has not cleared due to the holiday).

Column T is for the description of where the money comes. So if it comes from your employer you can Put Job1, if its from Taxes, you label it Taxes and So on. Column U is the amount. After you add the amount you need to also add what account it went to, so if you get Job1 pay, put the total in column T, say $2000, and then on column U put the same amount, or if you get Interest1 from Savings1 then put that in column T and then on column V.

Then on Column V and W, you can add anything that you pass from your checking account to your savings accounts (I have two, one emergency and one long term). So if your paycheck was $2,000 and are saving $500 of those, you put the $2,000 in Column T and U, and then the $500 in column V or W.

Y9 through AC20 gives you a few current and estimates totals. Y13 holds a marker for the amount you have available in your Checking account. Y14 and Y15 have your Savings individually, and Y16 have them totaled. Y17 has your total liquid assets, Checking plus Savings that you currently have available after all expenses.

MTH/YR EST (beginning in Z12) has your estimated Monthly expenses considering your YEARLY average daily spend (this will become more accurate as the days go by).

EST MTH SPEND S16 (beginning in AB12) has your estimated Monthly expenses considering you CURRENT MONTH average daily spend (this will become more accurate as the days go by). (Thanks to u/benishiryo
 for this nice formula)

The boxes labeled Net Gain in column Y Show the relationship between the amount you spent that month with the amount you made that month. If it’s a negative number, you spent more than you made.

Row 369 gives you your up-to-date year totals in each category for the expenses. For the Income section it gives you your Total amount in Bank (Checking and Savings), total income for the year, and Checking, Savings, and Investment amounts individually.

the Monthly Payments section starting at B372, simple adds the defined amounts that need to be paid each month, settings a basic expenses monthly total. (this helps me see how much I spend over the basic things I need to pay for).

In the Income Section starting in S372 you can change the formulas in S373 through O378 to include your source’s names. This goes with what you put in Column S and it keeps track for you of the income per source (they are case sensitive).

The section starting at B382 is the totals from column O neatly organized to see the month expense totals, average, minimums and maximums for each category. You can make some neat charts from this.

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to explain what the sheet does.

579,Healthcare is a legitimate FIRE hazard,,1402,ew75cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ew75cf/healthcare_is_a_legitimate_fire_hazard/,1580398491.0,"Stories like below remind us that just because you have insurance, doesn't mean you are covered:

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/29/800870904/a-41-212-surgery-bill-compounded-a-patients-appendicitis-pain](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/29/800870904/a-41-212-surgery-bill-compounded-a-patients-appendicitis-pain)

Anytime you go to a doc office or a hospital, you sign an agreement that essentially says ""whatever the insurance company doesn't pay, I will"". At that point it doesn't matter whether your maximum out of pocket is 10k or whatever. The hospital can charge pretty much whatever the fck they want (the *chargemasters* are KNOWN to be fictional & unquestionable). If they charge 10x the Medicare rate and the insurance company tells them to take 2x or fuck off, then guess who is on the hook for the rest? In my state ONE organization has already bought up nearly all the hospitals. So much for competition, and they can now charge however they want. 

Regular retirement typically offers Medicare protections. Early retirement serves up this ever-present risk of being on the hook for a surprise medical bill that can ruin early retirement plans (not to mention the difficulty of getting back into work after such an event, both in terms of gap and medical needs).

Am posting this to vent my frustration at this BS, but also to see if there are any tips to mitigate such risks. I understand that people generally don't care about this until this happens to them.",financialindependence

581,How do “normal” people even retire?,,1389,fi2gfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fi2gfd/how_do_normal_people_even_retire/,1584117333.0,"So I’m 23 and have been reading this sub a lot. I’m very interested in investing, despite having only basic knowledge of how to do so. I’m a long-term investor who is trying to retire early, not make a quick profit. But after reading hundreds of posts here, it got me wondering - how the hell do normal people retire? I’m on a subreddit where everyone is knowledgeable about how to reach early retirement. Even then, it seems with most peoples plans, they’ll retire around 60. If that is with extreme budgeting and great investing strategies, how the hell will some normal dude with no investment knowledge make it? 

By the looks of it, you need a good chunk of money saved to retire (depending on where you live this “chunk” varies). So what happens when the average dude checks his savings account as 65 and sees he only has $125k saved? Will people be working until they die in this generation? It sure seems like most people won’t be able to retire if this is the kind of stuff it takes to retire. 

Either way, glad I’m starting now. I’d love to retire early, or hell, even just at 65.

Edit: one question. When you guys plan on retiring, are you going to pull money from investments or are you going to live off of dividends? What would you do if you’re living off investments and something like this happened where a recession occurred? Your retirement funds could be dropped in half for 10+ years",financialindependence

* 40. Married. Two young kids. Spouse doesn’t work
* San Francisco area. Engineer at a FAANG company

&#x200B;

**Financial**

* Net worth: $4m
   * Taxable index funds: $2m
   * Long-term vested company stock: $900k
   * 401k: $800k
   * Roth IRA: $200k
   * 529: $100k
* Allocation across all funds: 40% Total US, 30% Total International, 10% Emerging, 10% REIT, 10% Total Bond
* Cash dividends from taxable funds: $3,000/mo ($36k/yr)
* Renting. No mortgage or other debt
* Vehicles are new, dependable, and paid off. Keeping as long as possible
* Last year’s spending: $8,500/mo ($100k/yr)

&#x200B;

**FIRE plan**

* When: A few months
* Type: FatFIRE, maintaining current lifestyle
* Move: To an area with much lower housing costs. Most other expenses are 20% cheaper there
* Estimated max retirement spending: $8,500/mo ($100k/yr), although will likely be lower due to new COL
   * Housing: $3,000/mo ($36k/yr). Rent while getting to know the new area before buying a $750k house. Put $300k down payment down to stay under the jumbo loan limit of $450k. 30yr fixed mortgage on $450k is about $3,000/mo including property taxes and insurance. No intent to pay off early. Although this may seem extravagant, a nice home for my family is a reward after years of hard work
   * Healthcare: $2,500/mo ($30k/yr) to be safe. Open market. If annual MAGI is <$100k, would be eligible for premium tax credit with two kids
   * All other expenses: $3,000/mo ($36k/yr), although likely lower. Travel is the biggest wildcard
* Withdrawal strategy: Dividends from taxable funds of $3,000/mo ($35k/yr) will take care of a chunk of my overall $8,500/mo ($100k/yr) expenses. The remainder ($5,500/mo) can be drawn down at a 1.8% rate from pools like my remaining company stock, Roth IRA contributions, and taxable funds (although this would mean fewer dividends going forward). If dividends aren't used, withdrawal rate would be 2.8%. According to EarlyRetirementNow, anything <3% is [close to fail safe](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/).
* Withdrawal frequency: Monthly, to keep more money invested longer
* Equity and bond allocation change over time: None, remaining high equities. I'm aware my house will become a larger part of my assets over time
* How to spend the time: Raise kids. Time with family and friends. Travel. Personal coding projects. Plenty of hobbies
* Future side income: Not banking on any at the moment

&#x200B;

**Last checkup questions**

1. What’s the best way to handle the $900k in company stock? Selling it all before I leave would reduce risk and give me the cash I need for a future house down payment. However, it’d pile on top of this year's already high tax bracket earnings and create a huge tax bill in my first year of retirement. Alternatively, I could wait until next year when I'm retired and use the company stock as the first pool of money to draw down, and if I kept my income low enough (under $77k), I’d pay 0% capital gains on the chunk I'd sell.
2. Once the company stock is sold off completely, would Roth IRA contributions be the next best pool to draw from? This wouldn’t count towards income, making it easier to be under the limits for the premium tax credit and 0% capital gains rate. It’d also preserve my dividend income by not dipping into taxable funds yet.
3. How hard is to get a $450k mortgage without being employed? I’m hoping exceptions can be made for showing proof of large equity assets and having an 800+ credit score.
4. Overall, is my plan good enough to FIRE soon?

584,Beyond expense ratios and CAGR; why the intangibles of FIRE may matter more than the quantitative factors. My perspective based on ~8 years of early retirement.,,1381,kl4jm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kl4jm4/beyond_expense_ratios_and_cagr_why_the/,1609079376.0,"I am submitting this post to promote discussion about what I believe to be potential dangers associated with the pursuit of FIRE and to highlight the importance of, *throughout your life*,  attending to the qualitative factors that I believe are essential to a successful retirement.  My goal is to encourage those of you on the road to FIRE to take whatever steps you deem necessary to avoid these potential pitfalls.  

 I believe that, for some, FIRE becomes some sort of amorphous goal that provides both a degree of hope, *as well as an excuse to avoid working on the aspects of life that really matter*: social connections, meaningful goals, physical and mental health. This is especially true for people who, while highly intelligent and well educated, are relatively less adept at enhancing and developing the qualitative aspects of life.

Some of you may remember me from my previous posts.  Recently I have started to  think more about what accounts for post FIRE happiness, meaning, fulfillment and health.   I believe that, just as it is important to devote X percent of your salary to an IRA throughout your life, it is equally important to devote X percent of your time to physical and mental health, maintaining or rekindling old friendships and cultivating new ones.  Failure to do so puts one at risk for an unfulfilling and unhealthy retirement.  

It's as if some FIRE aspirants are saying to themselves: “Yeah, I’m in poor physical health, depressed and socially isolated and I hate my job.  But that’s ok, because, one day……”.  But then that day comes; you are FI, but with nothing with which to fill the void.  I have seen this before.  Retirement is often accompanied by a huge let down.  Some become depressed and drink.  Some stay at home all day, every day leading to friction with their SO.  Some blow vast amounts of money on baubles in *a vain attempt to find some sort of justification for the decades they had sacrificed to get to this point.*

I am eternally thankful to my parents who were wise enough to facilitate and support my nascent hobbies and passions.  Because of them I had endless things to motivate me when I stopped working.  I am equally aware that my natural tendency to reach out to old friends, work colleagues etc. meant that I had a deep and wide pool of social support when I need it.  Nevertheless, I have struggled with periods of loneliness since I stopped working ~8 years ago, long before I had ever heard of FIRE.  My new girlfriend has both added tremendously to my life and strengthened my understanding of the vital importance of close interpersonal relationships.   

There are lots of young, highly educated people who are generally dissatisfied with the ‘rewards’ of their sacrifices.  They are exhausted by meaningless work, narcissistic supervisors, back stabbing colleagues and no identifiable path to a better work life.  They are left to ask” “Why the f**k did I sacrifice so much?  For this?”      

I suspect that, to varying degrees, most of the people who are aspiring to FIRE are life long hard workers who have, throughout life, been rewarded for delaying gratification and have received accolades for their performance.

Unfortunately, this focus on career progress can lead to a self-reinforcing dynamic if you devote so much of your time and resources to work that you never develop hobbies, you become socially isolated and your physical/mental health declines. 

I imagine that for more than one reader of this subreddit, your first three decades go something like this:  You buckled down in school and got yourself into a solid university.  You moved to one city for undergrad, then a different city for your first job…by the time you are 30 you are likely to be living in a city to which you have few ties, far from home, old friends and family and with little in your life other than work.  Eventually, you become dissatisfied with this life.  If only…..FIRE!  You begin to fantasize about the day when things will be *‘different’*, and you work ever harder so as to hasten the arrival of FI/RE.  This can lead to a dangerous and self reinforcing cycle in which the unrelenting pursuit of FIRE comes with further neglect of the qualitative factors that are playing a significant role in life dissatisfaction.  

FIRE is not a panacea that will address all of the root causes of your dissatisfaction.  That is a much more complex process. Meaning in life, like financial independence, can be compared to tending an orchard.  In both cases is imperative that you nurture your seedlings/trees regularly, over the course of decades and long before you plan to eat the fruit.  If you wait until you are hungry, you are in trouble. I know that this is easier said than done, but just as it is important to begin saving and investing early and well before your planned FIRE date, it is equally important to maintain health, social connections and meaningful, non career activities while you are working towards FI.


**TL;DR** 
The quantitative aspects of FIRE are arguably less important to a successful retirement than the various, and often neglected, qualitative factors. I believe that many FIRE aspirants are so motivated to attain financial independence that they don’t consider the potential negative consequences of pursuing the quantitative aspects of FIRE (e.g., savings rate, CAGR, etc.) *at the expense* of what are potentially more important qualitative factors (i.e. relationships, health, etc).",financialindependence

I'm worn out.


I have saved and invested roughly over 50% of my paycheck for my entire post-university career so far (3 years) but to be honest? I'm miserable.


By all means, I should be proud of my ability to accomplish this feat. I make a modest $50k and live in a large US city. Yet I feel tired and bored all the time. 


Last Tuesday a colleague asked me to get a drink and bite after work. I couldn't remember the last time I had gone out to a restaurant on a weekday and for a reason I will never know - I said, ""sure"".


In feeling semi self-aware, I thought I should treat myself to a nice dinner. With my belly full, I felt a sense of pride. I had never used my money on a weekday for a mere ""fun"" time.


Since then, I have relatively been treating myself to not always the cheapest menu item when I eat out and heck, I even bought a new pair of shoes! 


And I feel happy.


I am far more relaxed at work, I laugh with my roommate.


I feel fortunate to realize being financially independent tomorrow is not worth suffocating your life today.

But wait, it gets worse. According to the [NBER](https://www.nber.org/aginghealth/2015no2/w21270.html),

>Nursing home expenses are a significant concern for the elderly, with  costs on the order of $77,000 to $88,000 a year in 2014. Relatively few  older individuals have long-term care insurance, so most of these costs  are paid either out-of-pocket or by Medicaid for those who have  exhausted their own financial resources.

Furthermore,

>Medical spending by the elderly is highly concentrated. Individuals in  the top 5 percent of the distribution of total expenditures spend about  $98,000 per year, nearly seven times the overall average of $14,000 and  accounting for 35 percent of all medical spending. Out-of-pocket  expenditures are even more skewed, with almost half of expenditures made  by the top 5 percent of spenders. As the authors note, ""even with  public and private insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenditure risk is  significant.""

This is a double whammy: your expenses are increasing the most precisely when your net worth is at its lowest level and decreasing. The SWR literature needs to address this vulnerability, because I don't think health care costs are going to go down any time soon. In the meantime, it would be prudent to work for a few more years and build up more of a buffer to account for this.",financialindependence

I know there is debate on whether or not mortgage principal should be included, but since the house appreciates, and the money can be pulled out in the future, we have chosen to include it.

We are pushing close to a 100k income, but are currently a few thousand short of that. I am an accountant for the state government, and my wife is a teacher. Our income is split fairly evenly. However, now that I've completed the CPA exam, I will start looking for something that has better pay and is closer to home. Having a dual income and being able to rely on family for very cheap childcare has been very beneficial to us.

We live in a wealthy county in middle TN, which I would qualify as being on the higher end of MCOL. Our house was $325k and is in a suburb of Nashville, which is just above median price in our county. Our sizable mortgage payment has certainly set us back a few years on the path to FI, but the house makes my wife happy. Sometimes, you have to make compromises.

We don't live deprived lives by any means. We are season ticket holders for the local professional hockey team (go Preds), and we take a couple nice beach vacations per year (substituting one to go to 2020 NHL Winter Classic). We also enjoy hobbies such as weekly board game meetups, playing our Wii U, neighborhood socials, taking our newborn and spoiled dogs for walks, and watching Netflix (it turns out watching reruns of the Office never gets old). I think what is most important is figuring out what matters to you and finding ways to do more of that. In our case, very little of what matters most is expensive. At the very least, we can find ways to make what we love less expensive. For example, we sell tickets to weekday hockey games to recoup most of the cost of season tickets, and we use travel rewards to never pay for plane tickets.",financialindependence
588,The Six Stages of Financial Freedom,,1371,4c15ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4c15ke/the_six_stages_of_financial_freedom/,1458998901.0,"This is a follow-up to a recent post from /u/firefirefire2016/ about how the path to financial independence [gave him the power to quit his job](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4bti89/the_fire_path_gives_you_freedom_long_before_you/) -- *long* before he was ready to retire. In that thread, I mentioned the idea that financial independence isn't a single fixed point or event. It's a series of stages. This post explains that concept further.

As most of you know, there are a lot of misconceptions about financial independence and early retirement. People think you must be ""rich"" or have a high income if you're able to quit your job before age 50 (or 40 or 30). And sure, having a high income helps. But the key skill, of course, is the ability to obtain a high saving rate, which I like to call ""profit margin"". (I find it useful to re-frame personal finance ideas in terms of business ideas. People like to argue that it's impossible to save half your income, but they don't get nearly so defensive about the idea you should have a 50% profit margin -- even though it's the *same exact thing*. Go figure.)

When I first started learning about smart money management, I thought that financial independence meant just one thing: Having enough cash saved that I'd never have to work again. After a few years of reading and writing about money full time, I came to realize this over-simplified things. Financial independence actually exists along a continuum. It's not all-or-nothing, but a series of incremental advancements. It's a process.

**Each stop along the road to financial freedom grants you greater autonomy and self-expression, and these are qualities that contribute to happiness.**

In early 2009, I wrote an article positing that there were three stages of personal finance. A few months later, I wrote a *series* of articles expanding that to five stages. Recently, after listening to [an episode of Radical Personal Finance](http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/174-the-stages-of-financial-independence-a-useful-roadmap-to-help-you-navigate-from-from-broke-to-financial-freedom/), I changed my model again. Today my roadmap contains six (seven, really) stages along the road to financial freedom.

The first stage (the ""zeroeth stage"") is actually a *lack* of financial independence. Stages 1-3 are what I call the ""surviving"" stages. Most of your work in these stages involves day-to-day household operations. You're building a foundation for greater financial freedom in the future. Stages 4-6 are the ""thriving"" stages. It's here that you have enough money to make choices that support higher purposes, whatever that means to you.

Let's look at each of these stages in turn. (And please note: I realize these divisions are somewhat arbitrary. *You* might choose to divide things differently. I welcome your feedback on how to improve this model.)

**Stage 0 - Dependence**
*In this stage, your lifestyle depends on others for financial support.* We *all* start here. We're born this way. How long it takes to break free varies from person to person. You're in this stage if you rely on financial support from your parents. You're in this stage if you spend more than you earn (if you're digging deeper into debt). Basically, if you're not earning a ""profit"", you are dependent on somebody else. You are *not* financially independent.

After you start earning a profit -- and again, this means you're earning more than you're spending -- you start down the road to financial freedom. Up first are the three stages of ""surviving"".

**Stage 1 - Solvency**
*Solvency is the ability to meet your financial commitments.* You reach this stage after you no longer rely on anyone for financial support. This means your income is greater than your expenses (you're earning a profit) and you're no longer accumulating debt. (You might still have loads of loan payments, but you're not adding anything new to the stack.) Some people reach this stage in their teens. Some *never* reach it. I'm ashamed to admit it took me 35 years to get there. (I just turned 47 yesterday, as a frame of reference.)

**Stage 2 - Stability**
*You achieve stability after you've repaid your consumer debt, established some emergency savings, and continue to earn a personal profit.* (This is roughly the same place as [Dave Ramsey's third ""baby step""](https://www.daveramsey.com/baby-steps/3).) It's possible that you still have some ""good debt"" -- college loans, a mortgage -- but you've paid off everything else and you've built a buffer of savings to protect you from unfortunate events. (One reader suggested this stage should be called ""resilience"" because you're able to cope with unexpected events and return to your original state. I like this.) I reached Stability at age 38 when I made the final payment on my consumer debt.

**Stage 3 - Agency**
*At this stage of financial independence, you have the ability to live and work as you choose.* You've eliminated *all* debt (including student loans and mortgages) -- or you could do so if you wanted. (I know first-hand that there are times you might choose to take out a mortgage even if you could buy a home with cash.) You have enough saved that you could quit your job at a moment's notice without hesitation. I reached this stage when I was 39.

It the final three stages on the road to financial freedom, your concerns move from surviving to thriving. Money is no longer a safety net. Now it's a tool to help you build the life you want for you and your family. Truthfully, that's all money *ever* is -- a tool to help you pursue meaning -- but most people don't understand they should use it that way. **Knowing what gives you meaning and purpose is a vital part of financial freedom.** I strongly believe it should be the starting point on this journey.

**Stage 4 - Security**
*You reach the Security stage when your investment income can cover your BASIC needs.* That is, based on how much you have saved and invested, you could live a meager existence for the rest of your life without worrying about money. Even if you never worked again, you could afford simple housing, basic food, essential clothing, and health care. I used to joke, for instance, that I had enough saved that I could live in a trailer park and eat TV dinners for the rest of my life without having to work again. That's the Security stage.

(For our purposes here, let's use a simple metric. When I say ""investment income"", let's just divide your total net worth -- what you own minus what you owe -- by 25. That number is *very roughly* how much you could draw down each year indefinitely. This isn't exactly right, but it's close enough for the point I'm trying to make. So, if you have $100,000 in saved and invested, we're going to assume you could take $4000 per year for the rest of your life. If this bugs you, substitute a ratio that makes you feel more comfortable.)

**Stage 5 - Independence**
This is the Financial Independence we all know and love: *Your investment income can support your current standard of living.* The money you have saved and invested would allow you to live like you do today...until the day you die. It covers the basics *and* creature comforts. In the words of Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin, you have Enough. I jumped to this stage just after my 40th birthday. I'm still in it today.

Note that Independence means different things to different people. For Jacob at Early Retirement Extreme, Independence means his savings will support a $12,000 per year lifestyle. For Pete at Mr. Money Mustache, it means $24,000 per year. For me, it means $36,000 per year (more when I'm traveling the U.S. in an RV -- *ugh*). For Jim Wang, it means $120,000 per year! Each of us has to decide what lifestyle matches our meaning and purpose...

**Stage 6 - Abundance**
*In the final stage of financial freedom, you have ""Enough -- and then some""* (again, this is how Dominguez and Robin describe it). Your passive income from all sources won't just fund your lifestyle forever, but it grants you the freedom to do anything you choose: indulge in luxury, build a business empire, establish a charitable foundation, explore the world, build a space program to rival NASA.

Here's the bottom line: **The more money you save, the more freedom you have, and the more risks you can take.** As your financial independence increases, you chip away at the wall of worry. You're able to make decisions proactively rather than reactively.

I think this roadmap is useful because it makes the concepts of financial independence more achievable for a *lot* of people. When I talk to the average person about retiring early by saving half her income, her eyes glaze over. She thinks, ""No fucking way I could ever do that."" It's too great of a leap from her current existence.

But if I re-frame things to talk about financial independence as a process, as a series of steps, then things suddenly seem more achievable. Maybe she can't save half of her income now, but she could save five percent. Or ten percent. And with that profit, she could work to move from Solvency to Stability. *That* is an achievable goal that builds financial confidence. And once she's accomplished that, she can work on boosting her profit margin to 15% or 20% so that she can pursue Agency.

Regular readers of [/r/financialindependence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) are like the pro athletes of the personal-finance world. We're all about high saving rates and investment policy statements and safe-withdrawal rates. I think it's in our best interest -- in the best interest of *everyone*, really -- to get more people ""playing the game"". The more folks we can get on the road to financial freedom, the better we all are.

There you go. A huge wall of text on an esoteric concept of little use to most people. But I think the folks around here might find it fun. I'm curious to hear what you all think. Would you split these stages differently? Would you add stages? Remove stages? What have I missed?",financialindependence
589,Last day at work! I’m officially FIRE today!,,1373,5ip7ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ip7ex/last_day_at_work_im_officially_fire_today/,1481906330.0,"
I’ve loved this sub for years and always planned to share some details on the day I finally pulled the pin.  My story isn’t particularly unique for this sub, but I thought I’d share anyway in case someone just tuned in or is worried that ‘slow and steady’ doesn’t work anymore.

Today is my last day @ my 9-5 job, and likely the last such day for the rest of my life. I’m 48, software engineer, good saver. When I turned 40, I got the FIRE religion and decided that I wanted to quit official work by the time my last kid went off to college.  Here are the highlights:

-	Spouse and I were both really committed to FIRE and we took pleasure in finding little ways to cut expenses and make things last. Paying off the house was a serious tipping point. That’s when the bucks started to seriously accumulate.

-	I’m planning to adhere to “4%” plan. Although I’m fairly conservative so I did my planning for 3% instead.  But I like the idea of investing sensibly, blindly drawing a certain % each year and letting the portfolio absorb the bumps over the years and not stress too much about it.

-	I’m invested almost 100% in stocks.  Mostly all index funds.  I’m planning for lots of ups and downs and just expecting to ride them out. (I didn’t sell anything in 2008 and just rode it down and up and didn’t freak out too much.  I like Dave Ramsey’s quote “You only die on the roller coaster if you jump off in the middle”)

-	I’ve been “FI” more or less for the last 2 or 3 years.  I was involved in an interesting work project at the time and decided not to quit when I hit my 4% “number”.  It was actually quite interesting continuing to work a bit once FI.  I could pick the parts of the assignments I wanted and just say no to the rest. I didn’t have to kiss any asses since I didn’t really care if I kept the job or not.  They were 2.5 really interesting years since I knew I had a glorious safety net underneath me.  

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks and share a bit of my experience. Happy to answer questions or take random abuse.

591,$100k the boring way,,1360,6tuhr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/,1502807765.0,"**Summary**

Reached $100k net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 4 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart with annotations included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Background**

My wife and I are both 28 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k, though we didn’t combine finances until after our engagement in 2014.

I was lucky to graduate from college in 2011 with no debt and an engineering degree. A scholarship paid half of my tuition, my parents paid the other half, and I paid for everything else with savings and working during the summers. I had a job lined up after graduation but decided to go to grad school instead, taking on $21k of student loan debt over the next 2 years while getting my Master’s. My wife paid her own way through private undergrad and public graduate school, which left her with over $100k in student loans after 7 years of schooling by the time it was all said and done.

**The Process**

2013: We both lived in the Midwest. I graduated with my Master’s and started on full time at the company I interned at while in grad school as an Engineer I. My starting offer was $63k and I negotiated it up to $67k based on comps for recent grads with my degree that my school published. My rent was $650/mo. I’ve always been a saver but wasn’t deep into the FIRE mindset at the time, so I started contributing 6% to the 401k to get the 3% company match and set to work paying down my loans. Wife (girlfriend) was a full time student in year 1 of her grad program and worked as a barista to pay the bills. We moved in together at the end of this year and paid $1400/mo in rent.

2014: I studied for and passed the FE exam (should have done this in undergrad) which was one factor in helping me earn a promotion to Engineer II at work and a salary of $73k. Wife was in year 2 of her program, still a barista, and we got engaged in the fall. This is when we first combined finances. Once I got the overall picture of our financial situation I started doing lots of FIRE-related reading and found MMM and this sub. The MMM post “Your debt is an emergency” really stood out to me, so from there we began aggressively paying down my wife’s student loans, some of which had interest rates as high as 6.8%! I started gradually increasing my 401k contribution and opened a Roth IRA.

Also at this time, I decided to begin passively monitoring jobs in the PNW. We knew we would like to move there eventually to be closer to family, but had no timetable. Everything happened kind of fast. By the end of November I had applied, interviewed, and gotten hired for a job that was a good fit for my skills. The starting offer was $74k and I negotiated it up to $82k. I was really happy with how the whole thing ended up working out, but the downside was that they weren’t willing to wait on my desired start date so I moved home without my wife (fiancee) which really sucked. 

2015: I started my new job and got a 5% raise after the 6 month probationary period to $86k. My wife (fiancee) finished her degree, moved to the PNW, and started her career in the public school system at $54k. We found a townhouse to rent at $1100/mo from a family friend. We got married and paid down over $40k of student loans this year.

2016: I got a 5% raise to $90k at my 1 year anniversary. We began saving for a new car, a house, maxed an HSA, maxed my Roth, opened a second Roth, and maxed a 457. The wife got a raise to $57k, and became nationally certified in her profession. I spent a few months studying my ass off for the PE exam and passed in the fall. This year we discovered my wife was eligible for a different loan forgiveness than PSLF that only required 5 years of work, so we ran the numbers and dialed back our loan payments significantly to hopefully take advantage of that in 2020. We paid off about $16k in loans this year and instead focused on maxing the previously mentioned 457 and HSA.

2017: I was promoted to Engineer III in the spring, and along with a COLA raise/market adjustment, now make $99k. Up to now I feel like my salary has progressed quickly, but it will likely be much slower from this point forward unless I change companies. My wife makes $67k after including the new yearly bonus for being certified. We both pay into our separate pension plans at work and are also each maxing a 457/401k. Not currently adding to the Roth accounts anymore, but we’re aggressively saving up for a house down payment. We dropped the HSA for this year since we are having a baby in the fall!

**Chart**

[Here is that whole story summed up in one diagonal line](http://imgur.com/a/ex2VQ). I marked the inflection points as best I could.

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 12/21/15 added the e-fund to Personal Capital tracking to get a better picture of our net worth.
3. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
4. 9/8/16 added $5k to make the e-fund value more accurate, got $5k inheritance :(
5. 11/21/16 received the remaining $10k of the same inheritance. The big dip right before this was Personal Capital messing up our accounts for a couple days.
6. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth!
7. 8/9/17 bought a car

**Current Finances**

* $41k saved towards a down payment, $15k e-fund, $7k in an HSA.
* $104k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* -$59k of student loans remaining, to be paid off by 2020.
* Budget is set for our savings rate to be 50% but we average about 60%. This will come down due to baby costs but I expect us to be in the 40-50% range still.
* Our FIRE goal right now is $1.5M.

**The End**

Overall, I’m not sure there’s anything super unique about our journey to this point, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing this with people in my personal life. We worked hard, invested in good educations leading to good careers, and saved religiously. It’s simple but it wasn’t easy - I definitely dove in head first to the FIRE concept and for a while it was a source of stress for me, always trying to increase that savings rate. In my natural tendency to engineer things, I had turned my life into an optimization problem.

It eventually occurred to me that I was stressed about saving money so that I wouldn’t have to stress about money and since then I’ve relaxed considerably. /u/MrLlamaSC‘s stickied post really resonated with me and I try my best to live by my dad’s favorite quote, “Everything in moderation, including moderation.” I’m sure there were many ways we could have done things differently or better, but I’m happy with where we’re at.

As for what’s next, we are in full baby prep mode now, so it’s nice that our savings are basically on autopilot and we can focus on our family. A house would be the next big thing on our radar, so we will save for that, but we aren’t in any particular rush. I will continue to track these things because I like numbers and we’ll just keep plugging away until the next $100k milestone. Thanks for reading!",financialindependence
592,Enlisted Military FIRE (I did it!),,1356,dec5cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dec5cn/enlisted_military_fire_i_did_it/,1570409261.0,"So, it looks like I’m FIRE’ing…  The boring middle is over!

36 years old, medically retiring from the military at 16 years.  I spent my entire career saving everything extra.  Every time I was promoted, the extra money went to savings.  I’ve lived like an E-5 since the day I turned E-5.  Tax returns, special duty pay, deployment pay, enlistment bonuses, raises, everything went into mutual funds.  I spent 10 years as a single dad and went car free for a little over half of it.  Got married last year and bought a house with my wife in St Augustine Florida.  Cash.  I guess I’ll get down to the numbers.

Investments: 210,000

House: 310,000

Rental property: 65,000 (That’s value minus mortgage)

Total assets: $585,000

So with a 3% SWR and a $20,000 annual retirement, that gives us $26,000 a year with no mortgage, and no health insurance costs.  And if the market takes a shit, I’ll still be making $20K a year.

Full disclosure is that my wife does still work and she has a 6 figure job, but if she were let go tomorrow, we would be totally fine.  She works now because she wants to.  (and she admittedly always will in some capacity.)  We are saving a disgusting amount of her salary, and she will probably get her doctorate at some point in the future.  I have my associate’s. 

This military medical retirement kind of came out of nowhere and now I’m coming to terms with the fact that I’ll never have to work again, 4 years ahead of schedule.  It’s kind of surreal.  The FIRE path for me was paved with a low desire for expensive things.  What Thoreau says in Walden about fashion and transportation resonated with me.  This week I threw away 10 year old pants because the zipper finally broke on them.  I have sandals that are 20 years old.  Being in the military helps, I guess, they tell you what to wear every day.  That’s going to be a weird adjustment.  OK, now I’m wandering.  Just wanted to say thanks here, I always loved seeing when people FIRE’ed it gave me hope.  Keep plugging away and watching those numbers grow!",financialindependence
593,I immigrated by myself 2 years ago - recently reached 100k NW at almost 30,,1353,j17we2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j17we2/i_immigrated_by_myself_2_years_ago_recently/,1601279517.0,"Thought I'd share my story here, since a lot of the first gen immigration stories I've seen in the sub were about people who immigrated with their parents as kids/teens, and my path was a bit different.

I lived in a third world country in south america. Classic middle class upbringing, didn't face any financial issues, but country is unsafe, getting robbed at gunpoint is a real possibility, city infrastructure falling apart, corrupt governments, etc. 

I'm splitting this in topics so you can skip to the end if you don't care about the background details = )

**Bachelors in home country:**

I would have loved to do my bachelors abroad, specially in the US, but it wasn't possible.

In my country, public universities are very competitive to get in, because they have no tuition, while the private ones do. I wouldn't call it ""free"" because the amount of taxes we pay in my country, for pretty much nothing in return, zero tuition in college is about the only thing we ever get back. Universities have way less resources in my country, but the schooling itself is good. I did well in the entrance exam, got into one of the top schools in latam and studied electrical engineering, which meant no school debt, which was fortunate.

**Experiences abroad**

During my studies, I spent a year studying abroad in Europe on a scholarship, which gave me a taste of what living in a 1st word country was like.

I also did a work-abroad program, working in the US for about 3 months during our school break. I got paid minimum wage, which was 7.25/hr at the time, working an unskilled job that was customer facing. I lived with roommates and kept expenses low, but what I could afford on that minimum wage in the US was so much more than what many skilled jobs would afford in my country. It was a very comfortable life for me in comparison, even though my american coworkers often complained about the pay. This helps put into perspective that it really depends on what a person's baseline is for comfort.

Both of those experiences abroad were also very competitive in school, and took a lot of preparing and keeping good grades to achieve.

**First job in home country**

I graduated 5 years later (engineering takes 5 yrs there) in a recession, where junior engineer jobs were impossible to find, while our alumni from only a couple years prior had much better luck in finding a first job and getting offers from their internships.

New-grad 'accelerated career' programs had become popular, were paying above market rate (which was crap at this point due to the economy), and were very hard to get in. It took preparing and going through long interview processes with many, until I finally got one. Mine had over 10,000 applicants for under 20 job openings. I hoped to join an American company because everyone I had ever met who immigrated to the US in the last few years, had done so by being transferred by their company.

So I joined this US company, stayed for almost 4 years, got promoted twice, and realized that getting transferred was never going to happen, despite the fact that I kept being told it could be a possibility. The last person to get transferred in that company had done so the year before I joined... and they apparently got very restrictive with it afterwards due to US visas getting harder to obtain (is what I heard, but who knows).

This made me feel very unlucky tbh, like if I had just joined a couple years earlier I could have had a chance.

**Masters in home country**

Anyways,  I became interested in Machine Learning and started doing a masters of science in the same university, part time, while working my full time job. This had no tuition cost, as I was doing research work, and I would've been eligible for a stipend for this work without the full time job. This was kind of a bummer, but my job salary was much higher and wasn't worth giving up for the stipend.

This masters took about 3 years. My schedule was insane. I was saving money aggressively, so I lived in a tiny studio reasonably close to school (cheap rent, mostly college students) and didn't have a car.

Nearly all my former classmates and all my coworkers had cars at this point, because public transportation sucks in my country. I took a bus from home to work and walked (over 30min each way) from home to school.

Because my classes (and later on, research meetings), were mostly at night, this often meant my class ended at 11pm, and I still had to walk home, eat dinner, then be up at around 6am the next day to be able to catch the bus and get to work by 8am. All my actual research work had to be done in the evenings (the nights I didn't have classes) and weekends, as well as any homework or studying for the exams.

This schedule was brutal but it allowed me to save a lot of money. I did make a few spending compromises: I nearly always bought premade food for dinner, usually from the grocery store. In my country, the extra cost between raw food and ready to eat is not as large as in the US, but either way, I did not have the energy to cook for myself with this schedule.

I  had a budget for 'fun money' so I could still do some things I wanted, but I was very aggressive in saving.

**Career change to ML:**

When my masters was almost finished, I started applying for ML jobs. They are (or were, at the time) extremely rare in my country.

I realized I had to widen my search, and applied for a job in a bigger city, with much higher cost of living. I got the job and moved there, trading my decent studio for a super crappy suite in a shared building. Despite the housing downgrade, I was actually paying more in rent than before.

The transportation situation got much worse as well without a car, I had to take a bus and then the subway, then walk in a sketchy part of town to get to the office. 

This was an European company with a US presence, but it was clear that getting transferred was very unlikely as well. But the salary was much higher, and getting the work experience in ML was also worth it.

**Studying in the US:**

At this point I decided to move to the US for a masters. I considered multiple options (fully funded Phd would take 5+yrs of living with a low wage; another research masters, perhaps partially funded) and settled on applying for 1-yr professional masters. These programs cost more in tuition, but after doing some math, I realized the extra living costs of staying in school longer, plus the opportunity cost of being away from the industry would offset that in my case.

I checked what my savings would let me afford, when converted to USD, and realized this would wipe out most of my savings, but I could swing it for programs with reasonable tuition (some were almost 6 figures, I didn't bother applying to those).

I applied to a few, and got a partial merit scholarship in one of my preferred locations. The scholarship was conditional on keeping a high GPA.

So at this point, I mapped my worst and best case scenarios. Worst case scenario would be I can't keep my GPA high enough and lose the scholarship and end up having to pay full price on the tuition, then don't land a job in the US and have to move back to my country. I noted in this scenario, most of my savings would have been wiped and I would be back where I started but with nearly 0 NW, and a US diploma (which would not make my salary any higher in my home country since I already had a local masters). Btw, flunking the program was not a worst case scenario I considered as I had always been a good student and had faith in my ability to complete it without any issues.

The best case scenario would be I keep the scholarship, pay reduced tuition, land a high paying job in a HCOL city and save most of my income, and ""pay off"" myself for all the tuition+living costs of the masters in about 1.5 years on my projections, then stay for another 1.5 years (maximum duration of a student visa post graduation is 3 years for STEM majors). It would still be unknown how long I would be able to remain in the US afterwards, as that depends on a bunch of visa variables that wouldn't depend just on me, such as getting selected in the H-1B work visa lottery). But at this point, the extra 1.5yrs of savings in dollars would make the whole thing a clear financial win, when compared to wages in my country.

When I put in my notice at my job, they offered me a raise and a promotion, and it was hard to turn it down, but I knew it had to be done, so I left.

During my masters, I lived in a make-shift ""room"" in a living room, so I saved a lot of rent, at the cost of my sanity, because my roommates really didn't make it easy.

Someone cooking in the middle of the night (literally, like 2am) with the lights on (and kitchen/living room were combined..) was at least a weekly occurrence, dirty dishes in the sink all the time, having multiple visitors in the super tiny 2-bedroom frequently, sometimes sleeping in the kitchen (seriously, wtf). Anyways, I can't say I regret it because I truly saved a lot of money, but there were many times I felt ""I'm too old for this s\*\*\*\*"".

I did one internship during the program, at one of my favorite startups, which was a great experience, and allowed me to have a little bit of income, plus they had free lunch and dinner, so the days I were there were the days I ate best during that year. I quickly learned that eating take out everyday was not going to fly in this city like it did in my home country, because prices were insane. So I learned to cook cheap stuff with quick recipes, lots of quick baked potatoes in the toaster oven and rice in the rice cooker, fried eggs, and a fair share of ramen in the nights prior to exams, etc.

**Full time job in the US:**

I applied to over a hundred job postings, and I as admittedly very picky at first, which some of my professors disagreed with. I wanted to give myself a couple months

where I only tried for jobs I truly wanted, and gave myself a deadline, where I would start applying to ""anything within reason"" if I didn't get it by then.

I couldn't take too long to get a job, otherwise I would not be eligible for a visa extension. The jobs I wanted were very technical, and usually required things like leetcoding and solving ML things live on a whiteboard or over the phone, so I practiced for those quite a bit. I felt I should have practiced even more, but after all those years of full time job + masters, plus the 1yr intensive program in a new country, I was getting very tired at this point, and was mindful not to burn myself out.

After too many applications with no responses, I landed 3 offers. One of them was a big N company, which was precisely what I wanted, so that's the one I took. At this point some friends and I started going to movies / restaurants / short weekend trips more frequently. Those expenses went up but not by too much. I also stopped eating ramen and frozen food so frequently, and started buying better, but still cheap stuff.

I finally moved out to my own tiny studio in an old building in a cheap part of town early this year, and despite the rent hike, I don't regret it at all, and is the best ""splurge"" I could make. I spent over a decade living like a broke college student, and I feel like I can finally get some of the things I want now. Such as I had wanted a 4k TV since forever, and I finally bought one this year (still wanted for it to go on sale, and got one for 500, so nothing nuts)

**Now:**

I've been with my company for about a year now, and I got promoted last month. So things are good. I reached my goal of saving up the same amount I spent during my masters in less than a year, in part due to the signing bonus, which I did not account for, and my initial salary was also higher than what I had projected. So I'm actually doing a bit better than my ""best case scenario"" I mapped out before coming to the US. These last few years have not been easy for immigrants, and I don't want to get political, just saying the uncertainty and stress surrounding added visa restrictions have been significant, so I am very grateful that things have worked out for me so far.

So yeah, this has been my path so far. I was very fortunate in many aspects (growing up middle class, no family/health issues, no disabilities), but also, compared to others, there were times when I felt others had it so much easier (being born in a 1st world country; getting a visa through family; immigrating years ago when the process was easier; having a rich uncle who sends you to undergrad abroad; getting employed/transferred because you know people in high places; graduating when engineer jobs were peaking, etc).

I figured all I could do was work with the situation I was in, there's always someone who has it better or worse, and through hard work, I took a few leaps of faith, and it all ended up working out. I know many people in similar jobs to mine were able to reach this same milestone in their early 20s, but also many aren't even nearly there yet despite years of 6 figure salaries, due to higher spending. so it's all relative.

To me FI is much more of a goal then RE, because I like my field of work, but I want RE to be a possibility, because I may feel differently in 10 or 20 years.

I have met many people who had a similar immigration path to mine (although from latam to the US is relatively rare, most I've met are through family immigration), but got the feeling it wasn't very common in this sub, so wanted to share. And if anyone is a fellow immigrant, I hope you found this encouraging.",financialindependence
594,Quarantine Gave Me the Nudge to Pull The Trigger on RE,,1355,g9rk05,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/g9rk05/quarantine_gave_me_the_nudge_to_pull_the_trigger/,1588095064.0,"Hey all!

My spouse and I hit our FI # last year. He's in tech and I own a hair salon. We also have one rental property. (Our plan is to eventually have one more.) Being financially independent was always our goal. We're in our 30s, so retiring seemed ridiculous. Our normal workdays can be 10-14 hours long, and for two workaholics, we wondered what we'd actually do with ourselves without work to fill the void.

Enter coronavirus. My salon has been shut down for almost two months, and our CA stay-at-home order was just extended for another month. My husband is working from home, but with limited hours. I'm finally getting a taste of what retired life looks like, and not going to lie, it's surprisingly awesome.

We have a relaxed breakfast together every morning. I've been slowly working on turning our small yard into a permaculture food forest, and it's amazing how much progress can be made without work in the way. I've been volunteering for a covid-assist group, delivering groceries to people who can't leave their homes, which gets me out on my bike every day. I cook all of our meals, a lot of which comes from our own gardens, so we're eating much healthier. I still make videos and posts for the salon's social media, all creative looks that I feel inspired to do--not pressured to do, which is how I felt when I was working full time.

We're both calmer and happier these days. Our house is actually clean. (Something we never had time to do.) And we fight so much less. I told him that I'm dreading going back to how things were, and he agreed: our life before quarantine wasn't sustainable. We were heading for burnout. We're now looking into purchasing our second rental property, and then finally taking the plunge into RE. 

Without the shutdown, we probably would have been too scared to ever leave our jobs. This was definitely the nudge we needed.",financialindependence
595,FIRE update 1 year in - Lean(ish) FIRE accidentally turned into Coast FIRE? A case study to consider for those who are on the fence about pulling the trigger.,,1351,ig9nmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ig9nmu/fire_update_1_year_in_leanish_fire_accidentally/,1598351940.0,"My wife and I FIREd last year with about $1M invested, and 1-1.5 years of cash on hand.

The original plan was to completely stop working, and follow the standard 4% rule to live off approximately $40k/year. We thought we could do this because we had spent the past 8 years diligently saving, being frugal, and finding ways to maximize investment value.

What actually happened was the following:

* My wife's solo business kept generating some income without a lot of time investment (a lot of that was momentum, so we expect it to slow down at some point without some more effort)
* I got antsy to find some freelance software development work after about 6 months. I was so burned out when I left my job, I could not imagine this happening, but it turned out I really just needed a 6 month sabbatical. Now I have one project that takes up about 15 hours a week, which suits me perfectly.

The result of these two things was that we recently had a moment of clarity. For our situation, we can work maybe 25% as hard as we used to, and generate more than enough income to cover our annual expenses. We can also do this while pursuing our pre-FIRE goals, which mostly involved slow travel (yeah, maybe next year...) and raising our daughter without having to send her to daycare.

Of course, this is really just Coast FIRE that we stumbled into. The difference being that we are now ""coasting"" with the amount invested that we planned on living off indefinitely. If we can keep this up for the next 15-20 years, we will be comfortably sitting on a portfolio of $2.5M to $4M, which should be more than enough to ""actually retire"" in our late 40s/early 50s.

The other nice side effect of this strategy is that if we make significantly more than we need to live on in a given year (which is happening this year), we can choose to loosen our belts a bit and splurge on large expenses or add to our investments.

Anyway, I know this is a specific situation that does not apply to everyone, but I urge anyone who is close to pulling the trigger on FIRE to consider if this could work for you. For us, it really is the best of all worlds, in terms of happiness, security, and freedom.",financialindependence

i've ben feeling a whole host of emotions to be sure, though the excitement is finally peaking vs. the anxiety associated with such an enormous change. i know i'm ready, and i'm well prepared so that the family is in good shape. so why worry, right? my wife and i are in our mid-late 40s and have $3.5M in our investment portfolio, with good positions in post-tax brokerage as well as retirement accounts. our cash cushion is in a good spot to carry us through the present wild times for several years without ""needing to"" sell assets. our WR will be low 3% at present, and will likely decrease further depending on whether if/when we take on some fun work ideas we have been exploring. we are also relocating to a lower COL area shortly.

we can all do this! thanks to so many for great information and guidance along the way. i look forward to reading more stories of people hitting their FIRE goals!",financialindependence
597,Is the success of the FIRE movement built on the back of 10 years of tremendous stock market growth?,,1346,chteeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/chteeh/is_the_success_of_the_fire_movement_built_on_the/,1564088063.0,"It seems that so many people are firing because in the last 10 years, the stock market has been performing extremely well.

What happens if the market tanks or is stagnant for 10 or 20 years (similar to what Japan experienced from 1990s to 2010s)?

I know back-tests show that this will work itself out over 30-40 year timelines.  

But, how do you stay disciplined when your hard earned money is tanking for 10 years in a row?

And for those that already FIRE'd are there signs / certain limits that you set such that once those limits are reached, you would go back to work?  And wouldn't it be hard to find work when you are out of experience and older in a market down-turn?  

I am excited about the FIRE movement, but my nervousness and paranoia always get the better of me.  Would love to hear people's thoughts on ""Plan B"" if VTSAX is not doing well for 10-20 year stints.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: I do want to point out that people are saying with a SWR of 3.5-4%, and using historical data, there's 95% success based on FIRECalc.  However, I noticed that ""success"" here just means having more than $0 before the end of your retirement period.  A good portion (maybe 10-15%) of the ""success"" lines will result in you having a fair bit less than your initial nest egg.  All I'm saying is that I would be pretty nervous about making any withdrawals if my nest egg dropped 20-30%, but according to FIRECalc, I should still be ""fine"".  

So, at what % drop would you start working again?  If your nest egg dipped to 80%? 70%? 50%?  In those situations, you could still be ""fine"" according to the FIRECalc.",financialindependence

He preached living a simple life, not chasing wealth, status or fame, but rather pursuing more meaningful ends - spending time with friends and family, in nature, appreciating life.

He actually FIRE'd in 307 BC, leaving the social life of Athens to retreat to 'a garden' to live the simple life with his friends.

You can read more about him on wiki, I suppose, but here are some quotes:

* If you wish to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires
* He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing
* It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet, than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble
* Not what we have but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance
* Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for
* The wealth required by nature is limited and is easy to procure; but the wealth required by vain ideals extends to infinity
* Of all the means to insure happiness throughout the whole life, by far the most important is the acquisition of friends
* I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what I know they do not approve, and what they approve I do not know",financialindependence

But then earlier this year, I had a revelation:  something like 85% of my spending is fixed.   Student loans, rent, utilities, food, and saving for retirement take up a bulk of my expenses. Even things like going out for dinner; if I have $200/month budgeted for that, and go over by 15%...that's still only 30 bucks.  Or if I have $1000/year for clothing budgeted, and under-spend by 15%, that's still only 150 I've saved for the entire year.  At the end of the day the overages only set me back in that decade of tracking by ~$4000.  When I combined the fact that I'm trying to get into the 7 figures to retire, that's a drop in the bucket.  Plus I actually make that in less than a week. I was talking with another coworker who's doing FIRE and he actually hasn't tracked anything in 15 years; he funds his retirement accounts, pays his mortgage (when he still had one), pays his utilities, etc.  Once those are out of the way, if there is any left over that's his pool for spending.  

I still track all of my savings accounts, retirement accounts, debt accounts, etc. but the actual expense tracking turned out to just be a chore with relatively little value.  In the 8 months since I started doing this I've been plugging along just fine hitting my savings goals, and it's one less time-sink to dump effort into.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4xnazq/sanity_check_for_burned_out_35yr_old_looking_to_re/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Since that post, I worked another year or so, and got a windfall from crypto which put my net worth at close to $2M. I bought a $400k condo in a ski town and quit my job in May 2018 at age 36.

I've been feeling nauseous and losing sleep over the recent market drop. I took a look at my budget and think I am still ok, but if the market loses another 30-50%, I'm not sure what I'll do. Having been doing nothing but play video games and snowboarding the last two years, I doubt I could get another engineering job, even at a much lower salary. Before I retired, I said as long as there isn't another great depression, I'd be fine...

Anyway, here are my numbers.

Paid off condo - $400k, not included in WR calculations. A lot of people said it was smarter to get a mortgage at a low rate so I could keep more money invested, but I'm glad I went with buying my home outright. I know I just have to cover taxes and HOA and I'll have a place to live.

Various investments - $1.35M. This was 1.85 just a few weeks ago. Fairly well diversified, but still stock heavy. Had about $100k left in crypto which got cut in half the last few weeks. So much for BTC being digital gold lol.

Actual total spending in 2019 - $43,283. 

Income from renting out my condo on AirBNB and living with parents for \~5 weeks during peak ski and holiday season - $9k 

Using the $1.85M figure which I finished at last year, my WR was 1.8% for 2019. Using my current portfolio of 1.35M, WR jumps up to 2.5%.

I think I can cut back to \~$35k spending this year by eliminating restaurants, travel, and some hobby related spending, which would put my WR at 2.0%, assuming I can rent my place again next winter for \~$9k again. That is a big assumption given the trajectory of the economy. I still have a little breathing room before I hit a 3.5% WR. At that point I'd have to start looking for any kind of work.

Anyway, my advice is don't do leanFIRE. If I didn't have some cushion and low WR numbers, I'd be in a full blown panic. Give yourself a lot of room in case the unthinkable happens, e.g. a pandemic.",financialindependence

I like reading the personal accounts so I thought I'd post mine.

**2014**

* June - graduated college with a net worth of $0 (was lucky to not have student loans)

* August - started working at a job with a $60K salary and $12K sign-on bonus in a LCOL city.  Rent was $675 with a roommate.

* September - bought a new sub-compact car for $17K, which I believe is one of the cheapest new cars to own over 5+ years.  I'm hoping that this purchase comes out to costing around or less than $5K/year average.  I'm not very knowledgeable about cars so buying a new car seemed like a better option for me than an older car that might require more maintenance.  


**2015**

* April - received a $7.5K bonus bringing total year's compensation to about $80K.  Also received a raise to $67K.  
I hit about $25K net worth around here.

* July - moved to a HCOL area with income of $75K not including bonus.  This was a move my job insisted on, and I was a little uncomfortable with it because $75K in a HCOL area is quite a bit less than $67K in a LCOL area.  I justified the move because of the increase in career opportunities ultimately.  Rent jumped to $1375.

**2016**

* January - I was very unhappy with the team I was on and started feeling depressed because of work as well as compensation.  I also had few friends in my new city.  I felt I had made a bad career decision and considered looking for a new job.

* April - My bonus this year was about $10K, bringing total compensation to about $85K.  I also received a $2K raise to $77K.  I was still unhappy and started looking for a new job.

* July - I changed teams at work, which was a huge relief because I was so unhappy on my previous team.  I still wanted to make more and so I kept looking for new jobs.

* August - hit my Mint goal of $65K in cash.

**2017**

* January - I got offered a new job and brought the offer to my boss, who matched the salary of $95K.  I know this isn't recommended, but it was the absolute right decision for me.  Can talk more about this if any of you are interested.

* April - Received an $18K cash bonus + $10K deferred cash (I get it over 2 years), bringing total compensation to $113/$123K depending on how you look at it.  I expect my compensation to go up from here pretty rapidly because I've hit a point in my company where they will give equity.

* May - turned in a large expense report, bringing my official net worth to $100K.  Note that this does count my car, which I value at $10K.

**My thoughts**

* While I feel proud of saving this much, I think it wasn't that hard to do at my income level.  There's definite evidence of lifestyle creep here.  I saved about $33K each year, even though my income has gone up.  Part of this is the move to a higher COL, but I know I could have saved more here.  I don't currently have a roommate, for example, and it's not impossible to think I could have learned more about cars to feel comfortable buying a used car.

* At the same time, I was fairly depressed in 2015/2016, and I am proud of pulling through.  Part of the increase in spending is due to making more friends, which I am proud of doing.  As some background, I suffered from extremely severe depression in college, so it's important for me to recognize when finances need to take a backseat to basic happiness.  I spend money when it makes my life easier or happier, and I am proud of doing that.  What I want to eliminate is spending that doesn't bring me happiness proportionate to the $ amount.

* I'm very lucky to have started adult life off with no debt.  I went to a top college that was very expensive, and I haven't recouped that cost yet (I'm not actually paying my parents back, but I like to think of it that way sometimes).  While I wouldn't have been able to get my job without going there, I think there are similar career tracks where I could be making an equivalent amount.  When I have kids, I hope to retire in a state that has excellent public colleges (I grew up in a state with very poor public colleges) if we still have the absurd setup that exists now.

We recently started giving our older two an allowance of $1/ week. The first week went as you might expect: we went to the grocery store, they found some candy that cost exactly $1, they spent all their money. They did bring it home and split it with the littler two because they ""didn't want them to feel left out"", but that's just a side bonus.

&#x200B;

The real win came a few weeks later. We'd been giving them their allowance but hadn't had an opportunity to take them to the grocery store in a few weeks (we normally shop at restaurant supply shops for cheap bulk foods, not many lower priced things there). When the time did come for the grocery store, I warned each of the bigger girls to make sure they brought their purses. After a few minutes I checked on them and in a moment of absent-minded parenting noticed that they had left most of their money on their shelves.

&#x200B;

Me: ""Girls, don't forget this money here, you'll want it at the store.""

One of my girls: ""No, we talked about it and we decided to leave most of it here so we wouldn't be tempted to spend it. We're only each taking one dollar so we don't feel like the other has more.""

I'm not paraphrasing. I was floored, and immediately quoted them in an email to their Dad so he could also jump up and down like I was doing mentally. They are miles ahead of where I was in any of my first two decades; it really is possible to teach prudence guys!

Location: Dumaguete, Philippines- 1.5 hour plane ride from Manila

I've been on strict home quarantine for over 5 weeks. The President's lockdown on the country's capital (home of 12 million people) is more restrictive than any place I know not named Wuhan.

On the plus side, I'm blessed to be staying in a beautiful house. I do yoga on a manicured lawn in a well-tended garden. A fantastic cook and a delightful maid make sure my girlfriend and I are taken care of. Nearly every day has been sunshine and blue skies.

On the downside, the ""enhanced community quarantine"" (what the government has dubbed this lockdown), allows only one person in the house to leave for any reason. I am not that person. **I literally am not allowed to leave my home for over 45 days (with new rumors to 75 days).** Still, I feel like riding it out on an island in the Philippines was the safest choice.

""Shelter in Place"" may be the right decision for me, but not everyone feels the same way. Since late January, the **US government has had to rescue 62,000+ US citizens stranded abroad due to the pandemic.** Tickets for these repatriation flights can run several thousand dollars, of which the US government pays zero. Given the cost and health risk of flying and returning to the US, I was curious what led some people to retreat for home vs. staying ""sheltered in place"" overseas.

Many of us talk about FIRE abroad. Some of us already are. Hopefully, this pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime event. But what if it isn't? When things get rough, and stress is high, when backup plans blow up in your face, do you stay abroad or pack up and head home? What criteria do you use to make a decision? How safe is safe?

I asked over 15 expats to share their stories of living abroad during a pandemic. Below are 2 stories (one who stayed and another who left) to shine some light on what life was like living overseas as COVID-19 hit. You can read about the decision-making process they went through. See how often discussed concerns like healthcare, safety, and cost of living factored into the decision to stay or go home. Find out whether they regret any of the choices made so far.

## The Frugal Vagabond

u/iamlindoro​

**STAYED: Granada, Spain**

>""Though we had plenty of warning that our window to travel internationally was closing, we opted to stay here for a number of reasons.""

## How long have you been living overseas, and where were you living before travel restrictions went down?

We've lived in Spain for just over two years. Spain is one of the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic and is subject to some of the most stringent restrictions on everyday movement in the world. Though we had plenty of warning that our window to travel internationally was closing, we opted to stay here for a number of reasons.

## Why did you decide to stay?

We saw that Spain was seeing large numbers of infections and deaths despite excellent universal healthcare and an almost universal acceptance of the restrictive quarantine. We compared those conditions with the casual (or even arrogant) attitudes we saw about the need to limit contact in the US, and anticipated that the US would soon carry a much higher risk of infection with coronavirus.

## If the pandemic extends for another 30-60 days, would you make the same decision?

Ultimately we are more confident that Spain will take the necessary steps to contain and hopefully eliminate cases going forward. We do expect the crisis to continue at least another 30-60 days and with that in mind, are comfortable with our decision. Shelves are well stocked at the grocery stores, and the only things we've missed out on here and there are creature comforts like a particular brand of candy or imported items.

## Was there any aggressive hording in Spain, similar to the toilet paper stories we are hearing out of the US?

There was exactly one day where we saw empty toilet paper shelves here in Granada: the day after they canceled school for the rest of the year in our province, which was also the day before the quarantine was declared. That day, there was also no meat in the store. Since that day, we haven't seen any obvious hoarding. There's always been enough of all of the necessities, but they're definitely being prioritized by supermarkets over some of the less popular creature comforts.

## You mention Spain's health coverage. Did the US health care system play a part into your decision making?

US health insurance played a small role in our decision, mostly because we have a Spanish policy that covers everywhere in the world... except for the USA. That's pretty telling, but logistically we tend to buy short term emergency policies when we visit the US, and I would be very anxious with such a minimal plan in the midst of a pandemic.

## Our Freedom Years

Stephanie & Gillian

**LEFT: Italy for Toronto, Canada**

>""We were safe and comfortable there for a month - despite being in the epicentre of the Italian outbreak - but knew we had to leave...""

## How long have you been living overseas, and where are you currently living?

We’ve been traveling full-time for the past six months. We were previously working as expats in Singapore but we were able to reach our financial goals, say goodbye to corporate jobs and set off for a life of travel. Our plan is to take the next few years to explore the world slowly, starting with Europe.

However, much to our surprise, we've found ourselves to be back home in Canada after a seven year absence. We had intended to be in Croatia by this time of year but our plans were cut short by the virus outbreak.

## Did you decide to stay overseas or return home?

When the COVID 19 outbreak became a global concern in March, we were in the midst of a two-month trip in Italy. We tried to leave Italy but our last-minute flight to Hungary was cancelled. We quickly decided to find sanctuary at a friend's holiday home at Lake Como in northern Italy.

We were safe and comfortable there for a month - despite being in the epicentre of the Italian outbreak - but knew we had to leave, not least because our Schengen visas were about to expire.

We then went to the only country where we were guaranteed to be welcomed, which is our home country of Canada.

## If the pandemic extends for another 30-60 days, would you make the same decision?

As long as the travel bans are in place, we will stay in Canada. Being here allows us to provide support to family during a difficult time. We are taking this situation as an opportunity to spend time with loved ones after having lived overseas for so many years.

## What city or country would be your primary choice to live during a COVID-19 lockdown, and why?

As value seekers, we would ideally prefer to be situated in a less expensive city than Toronto, although this is where our family lives. We would likely choose another large, interesting city in Canada, such as Montreal.

Of course, our main interest is getting back on the road again and picking up our travel itinerary in the Balkans. Here's hoping travel is safe again soon!

I was Sr Director at a large CPG company in the midwest.   Salary was 185 and 30% average bonus and some good stock option / grants.   I was vesting grants of roughly $40K a year, with a stock price 30% below all time highs.   I was in the Operations area ... plant management, supply chain, project management stuff.    Just under 20 years at the company.

I managed my own job reduction so that i received the package.   The package was 40 weeks of pay and vacation.   I also picked up unemployment for 20 weeks ...that was only worth $8K.

The leave plan was executed perfectly ... it took about 9 months of planning and conversations with some decent timing as a backdrop.    Big companies are always looking for cost reduction projects and i was able to add myself on to a larger project.   Being somewhere for 20 years and knowing most everyone made this somewhat easy but i also was in a role that could eliminated without a major reorganization of responsibilities.

I had about $1.2 MM liquid, $1.4 MM 401K / IRA, and $800K in deferred income ... payable over 10 years (roughly $80K a year).   All in all $3.4MM.   Wife has health insurance for the family and makes about $20K in a part time role.   We both get pensions at age 65 ... about $60K per year, neither is COLA.   3 kids ... oldest kids were just getting into college.  80% of the total college anticipated costs were accounted for.   With good returns i would not have to add to the 3rd kids college.   Basically needed $300K and had $220K.   As I type this, I'm still about $50k short but i have 3 years before i need the first installment for the 3rd child.

I spend about $125K per year.

Lessons learned in no particular order.

Don't count on your friends having time during the work week.   I thought i would be able to grab a few more beers mid week with one of my buddies during the work week.   That never really worked ... guys who are working all week and have kids never have much time during the week.

More exercise time ... yea, it's true but I worked out a lot before i left the job.  Outside of never missing a workout ... i didn't workout more or get healthier because i didn't work.

Less stress ... yea, it is less stressful but you find other ways to get stressed.   However, this was a win, no question.

Positive surprises -  I have spent more time with the kids.  That's all good.  Also, feel like i enjoyed more days of the week.   Enjoy my friends a little more.

Back to work as an owner / operator in a $200K revenue small business.   I was retired for about 16 months and then i bought a partnership in a small business.   I own 49.9% Now i work about 80% in a company with big growth opportunities and i should make about $40K a year.   A little stressful though as i'm dealing unwinding a few contractors from the business.   Legal stuff and then watching the customers to see if they stay with us.  Not sure how long i'll stay in the business.   At least another year.   I like it but not much $ considering the work right now.   I can probably sell my share for another $10K or so.

EDITS:  We sacrificed big time during our 20s through our mid 30s.   Drove older used cars (will never buy a new car, btw), didn't spend much $, saved as much as possible.   We never took expensive vacations and did everything on deal.   I spent so much time thinking about the day i could retire early.   I read a lot and pushed hard to get there.   Once we had the $ pretty much saved and i had a good income, we started spending more.   We went from spending $60K to $100K a year in just a couple years ... kids are expensive too as they get into all kinds of sports and interests.

I’m 24 out in the real world for 3 years with two different jobs.

Since 15 I feel like I’ve been running on a hamster wheel. It was nice then though because I had a cathartic release of freedom every 9 months from school. So it started off slower, and got faster starting in college. No more bursts of freedom. I’m crushed all the time. Life is a bunch of deadlines. I don’t have proper time for myself. I just want to go at my own pace again. I’ve never had a problem doing life by my terms. Seems like some people need other people to give them something to do (no offense).

Hopefully it gets better when I get out with a job in the real world, I said. But then I heard adults say that’s a lot of work too. One thing that stuck was “you get a choice between recovery and socializing.” I feel this way now.

The more I go on, it seems I was correct 9 years ago. The only solution in life is to have a ton of money. To buy time to actually and properly relax and go at my own pace to take care of myself properly in every way without having my time smashed by obligations fueled by money, ultimately others. 
Need to figure this out before it’s too late.

I've simply never been that ambitious, and what really attracted me to financial independence in the first place was that I could achieve it without all the normal career ladder garbage. I'll break down what I think got me to FI below.

* I've never been exceptional, but I found and moved to jobs that paid more. I think a key here is not being scared to move on, whether it be to another state or another job. Also, forget finding a job you ""love"", find something you tolerate that you are above average at. When you move, don't forget to roll your 401k over to Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab and invest in low expense ETFs.
* We waited to have kids. You don't have to be FI first, but have a solid emergency fund, no high interest debt, and a retirement fund started. 
* I've never been a great stock picker, but I didn't get scared and sell all my investments when the headlines screamed Armageddon.  Quite the opposite: in 2009 I had negative equity due to the housing crash, but I quit all my expensive hobbies and doubled down on saving. When your nest egg gets bigger, be relentless about expense ratios of your funds.
* Make more money, but keep your expenses the same. Frugality is easier if you freeze your standard of living than it is if you have to cut back. Where you do splurge, don't make it a recurring, unavoidable expense (spring for better hotel on a vacation vs. a BMW. A nice bike instead of a 4x4 that needs insurance/gas/repairs).
* And #1 key was a wife who made a decent income, and who was the ""saver"" of the relationship until I went hardcore and surpassed her!",financialindependence

My mom's dental bills are insane with her having to fix crowns, caps, bridges, etc. Perhaps she is an outlier, but last year alone my sister and I paid for her $3k outstanding dental balance. I understand a lot of these service expenses can be mitigated based on where you live and the type of housing you choose, but I don't think we can ignore medical costs.

I’ve been a long-time lurker here since I discovered FIRE back in 2014, but I’ve rarely posted. I hit $1 million earlier this year, and I wanted to share my story and hopefully exchange some valuable insights with you. It has taken me a while to work up the courage to share, but here goes. I’ll try to keep it fairly short and simple, although I apologize in advance for the long Background section, and I’ll follow up with more details as they come up in the discussion.


***TL;DR: I’m 34, single, watch collector, no children (and don’t plan on having any if I can help it). My NW reached ~$1 million at the end of August 2020. I increased my liquid net worth from zero to $850,000 in 6.5 years, and I aim to reach my FI number of $2.5 million by age 41. I don’t hate my job, but I do hate that it keeps me from staying fit and active, so the sooner I become FI the better. Look at my charts. Ask me questions or for more charts. Thank you for reading!***


**Background**

I grew up middle class in a developing country (Middle East) as an only child. I was privileged to have parents who were more than willing to forego most pleasures in life—including travel, nicer cars, etc.—and to instead spend every penny they had to make sure I received the best education possible. They put me in a private American school and paid for my college education, but they also were not the absolute savviest with money.

My health and education came first for my parents, but what came a very close second was every little whim and desire I had as a child—they spoiled me. They almost never invested, and instead spent all their extra money on whatever clothes, computers, videogames, music CDs, cameras or extra pocket money I wanted as a teenager. They found it very hard to say no to me. Because of this I grew up not knowing or appreciating the value of money, and by the time they (involuntarily) retired in their 50s they had virtually no savings.

What’s done is done, right? By the time I woke up to all this in 2013, I was 26 years old and armed with a pretty good education, but I hadn’t exactly been all that successful since graduating in 2008. I had gotten my CPA back in 2009 and was working at a public accounting firm making a measly $12,000/year (yes, that low, because developing country).

I hated my job, mainly because of the people I worked with, but I won’t get into that in any great detail. There was just a big gap between the way I had learned to work in a private/American education and the way I had to work ‘out in the real world’. I also had not been promoted in several years because I was seen by my peers and supervisors as a poor team player.

**Anyway, in early 2014, everything changed!** Thanks to the way my education and career start looked on paper—and thanks to LinkedIn Premium which I was (and still am) paying $30/month for—I was headhunted for a financial controller position in an east African country. This of course meant leaving my family, my city and my friends, and starting all over. To me this was all very new and scary, but it was almost a complete no-brainer. The move was to propel me from $12,000/year to $75,000/year + all the benefits that come with an expat position.

One thing that made it even easier for me to work abroad was my U.S. citizenship, which I got from my father’s side of my family. Anyway, I packed everything that mattered to me in a few suitcases and got on a one-way flight. My liquid net worth was negative at the time; I had $25,000 worth of credit card debt, plus more owed to my parents. I paid it all off within a few months of moving, but my parents later refused to let me pay them back what they’d contributed for an apartment back in my hometown. The apartment cost about $115,0000 and they’d paid for half of it. I still own it.

Since I made that move in 2014, I have made two more moves to other countries, and I’ve grown to quite enjoy my job and responsibilities. I’ve been promoted three times, and each promotion or move has come with a salary bump. I am now a CFO and my income has steadily climbed from the $75,000 in 2014 to $110,000 now in 2020. In addition to that, I get a ~30% performance-based bonus, and a 6% retirement benefit, plus company-paid housing, furniture, utilities, car, gas, internet, phone, house help, gardener, and two flight tickets home per year.

I’m fairly happy with how I’ve done over the past 6 years, but I look back and I still think to myself: What if I hadn’t been so spoiled? What if I’d learned the value of money earlier in life? What if I’d saved my money and started investing at the age of 21 instead of 27? Where would I be now?


**Current financial position**

I have an insane Excel spread sheet I’ve been developing and using for the last 6 years. I track every dollar I make or spend, every stock I buy, and hundreds of metrics. I do it religiously, and it’s made it very easy to pull numbers out to share with you guys.

In [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/tUgIRIN), my total net worth over time is in orange, and my liquid net worth is in black. The green line is my stock portfolio.

[This table](https://imgur.com/ny564mj) breaks down my current net worth near the end of 2020 and each of the previous 6 years. I’ve kept things pretty simple and my stocks are split between two individual accounts with two brokerages—there’s no 401k or IRA of any kind. As a U.S. citizen with no home base in the U.S., I get to exclude much of my income under the FEIE rule, but it also means I can’t contribute anything to a tax-advantaged account.

***EDIT: Several of you have pointed out an error I've made in the original chart and table. I erroneously included in my illiquid net worth (from 2014 to 2016) a separate property that my parents owned until 2016. I was tracking the value of that property in my spreadsheet before it was sold in 2016, but it was never a part of my own net worth and it shouldn't have made its way into the table and chart.***

***I've updated the [table](https://imgur.com/a/Dr2n09G) and [chart](https://imgur.com/a/KTdZoDH). Thanks for pointing out this error!***

These are currently my 6 largest stock positions:

|**Stock**|**% Gain**|**Value**|
:--|--:|--:|
|**TSLA**|+411%|$ 100,400|
|**NFLX**|+43%|$ 79,800|
|**AAPL**|+51%|$ 77,000|
|**FB**|+281%|$ 61,200|
|**AMZN**|+104%|$ 48,100|
|**MSFT**|+62%|$ 39,300|
 
[This chart](https://imgur.com/a/RYsIKmP) shows my income and how much of it I have spent/saved since 2014. I had a particularly low savings rate in 2016 and 2017 because in those years I pursued (and paid mostly out of pocket for) an expensive top 20 MBA degree. I find out more and more every day that this degree is (and will probably continue to be) completely useless to me, and that the ~$85,000 I spent on it would have been much better invested in the market. My CPA is what I need for my job, and my company never cared whether I got an MBA degree.

You can also see evidence of a fair amount of lifestyle creep between 2018 and 2020 in the chart below. In some years I travelled more than others, but generally my living expenses now hover around the $25,000/year mark.

I’ve also been very fortunate to have invested during the recent insane bull run, and [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/gNgO1wn) shows just how much it has helped my net worth over the last couple of years.

You can see in the chart that as of now near the end of 2020, I have invested a total of $300,000 into the stock market, and my portfolio’s estimated value at 12/31/2020 is $680,600. This makes for a total return of 121%, and I’ve calculated an annualized return of over 50% based on the timings of each of my deposits into the brokerage account.


**The way forward**

I feel that I’ve had a great deal of success over the past years, and I attribute most of it to a great ability to save thanks to the way my compensation has been structured and the FEIE. I do, however, recognize that the current market conditions which have allowed my net worth to climb as rapidly as I show in the table below will not necessarily last.

|Year|Net Worth||
:--|--:|:--|
|2014| 248,300||
|2015| 309,400|+25%|
|2016| 252,600|-18%*|
|2017| 379,700|+50%|
|2018| 457,100|+20%|
|2019| 676,000|+48%|
|2020| 1,071,000|+58%|
**Large decrease in NW due to severe drop in Dollar value of property valued in a foreign currency which suffered severe valuation in that year.*

I’ve calculated my FI number at $2,500,000, which I believe would allow me to live comfortably and be able to spend up to $80,000/year in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Based on my current and expected future salary, as well as my expected future savings rate. I’ve also calculated that I can likely achieve my FI number at age 41. Some of my assumptions include a 49-year retirement, average inflation of 2.6%, an annual contribution to my investments of $110,000 (adjusted for inflation), pre-retirement market return of 7%, post-retirement market return of 6%, fixed income return of 5.5%, percent in equities is 110-age (so it changes every year), and annual expenses of $80,000, which decline by 2%/year after age 65.

I guess one other thing I'm grateful for is that I'm not stuck in a loop trying (and failing) to get rich quick like I see some of my friends doing. I'm glad I'm taking the slow and steady path, and that I have the patience and discipline for it.

I’m very happy to get into discussions and answer questions. There are many more charts, calculations and concepts I’d love to discuss and share. The only things I do not want to be asked are 1) what countries I’ve lived/worked in, and 2) what companies I’ve worked for. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to read my story, and I’d love to hear your comments!

\*\*2021 update: Hello friends. If you've been using my sheet since 2020, you may have noticed that your sheet broke in a couple of spots. My sincerest apologies. The sheets below have been corrected, so feel free to just copy and paste your information over. It will now work for 2021 and beyond, plus I added a few extra metrics to the SWR sheet! 

&#x200B;

Make a copy of the blank spreadsheet for yourself (File > Make a Copy. Please don't request edit access; I won't grant it): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UKBknHUvup\_U\_Q\_4FWiKGROYiVYq0KVsTA7itl9zDBE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UKBknHUvup_U_Q_4FWiKGROYiVYq0KVsTA7itl9zDBE/edit?usp=sharing)

See how it looks filled out up with phony data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjr\_BW2BxaEtl13UY5JWigftGDWyY\_iUXgHTlBUOEYw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjr_BW2BxaEtl13UY5JWigftGDWyY_iUXgHTlBUOEYw/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I figured I'd share my personal calculator. Influence for this calculator comes from several Redditors here (trying to find their posts now so I can properly credit, if anyone recognized any tables from the SWR sheet as being a previous post here lmk) as well as the creator of the financialindependencesheet.

It may help to follow along with this explanation by looking at the filled-in spreadsheet as well as your own blank spreadsheet. **White/blue column = manually input. Gray/green column = don't touch**, it performs automatic calculations for you.

There are essentially 3 tiers of use for this spreadsheet: budgeting, budgeting + net worth, and budgeting + net worth + FIRE.

**Just Budgeting:**

What to fill in: If you just want to budget, then the only tabs you need to use are ""Out"" and ""Monthly Budget"" as well as the left third of the ""Dashboard."" You start with the Monthly Budget sheet. The only column meant to be manually input is the Budget column. Input your monthly budget. Then, go into the ""Out"" sheet and track your spending as you normally would. If you would like to add a note explaining the purchase you made that day, you can do so with the notes or comments feature of Google Sheets. You can see that in the ""Out"" columns of Gifts, Fees, and Misc, I've included notes where there is a value. The 2nd row of ""Out"" and ""Monthly Budget"" will show you a mini graph (sparkline) of your total spending. The 3rd row of ""Out"" and ""Monthly Budget"" will show you that category's spending for the current month.

Adding or removing a budget item: unless you're familiar with Google Sheets, I would encourage you to not delete nor add columns, since this breaks some of my graphs and aggregated tables. What you can do is rename a column in the ""Out"" sheet to something applicable to you, if one of the categories you see is not applicable. I've set the Dashboard and Monthly Budget sheets to automatically change the column headings when you change a budget item in the Out sheet. This will not work if you rename a column anywhere except for Out.

Viewing the Dashboard: For budgeting, the only thing you should edit in the Dashboard is the month and year you'd like to view. The day \*has\* to be 1. If you want a yearly view of 2020 and a monthly view of October, type 10/1/2020 into cell B5 and scroll down to see the pie charts and tables update.

&#x200B;

**Budgeting + Net Worth**:

All of the info above is still applicable. Now we introduce the ""In"" and ""Net Worth"" sheets, as well as the middle third of the Dashboard.

""In"": This is the first place you want to go for the rest of the sheet to work. In the white/blue columns, input information from your paychecks. If you don't have traditional 401k contributions/HSA contributions, feel free to leave those blank or replace the titles with any other pre-tax items you have such as health insurance premiums. If you have more than 2 pre-tax paycheck deductions, you can add columns between Pre-Tax HSA and Pre-Tax 401k. For the Net Income column, my recommendation is to put whatever your income for that month would have been if you had no pre-tax deductions/contributions, because I calculate savings rate as contributions/savings/debt repayment divided by net income, and if your net income is 19.5k lower due to 401k contributions you might artificially increase your SR number. SR is really whatever you want it to be, though. Up to you.

""Net Worth"": I've hidden row 4. If you've ever made contributions to your retirement accounts, open row 4 and put the total contributions since before 1/1/2020 in columns I through M. Then hide row 4. From then on, when you make contributions, put them in the proper month of columns I through M. Your current account balances go in columns D through G. If columns D through G don't reflect your investments, you can rename them. Input your account balances at the end of the month in columns B through G. Enter your debt in column H (it has to be negative, if you have any). Enter your contributions and payments for the proper month in columns I through N. The last thing you need to manually do in this sheet is scroll to the right and fill in the Savings Rate Goal for that month as a percentage. The rest updates automatically.

""Dashboard"": Once you've done all that for the month, check out the dashboard. You don't need to manually do anything for the Net Worth part.

**Budgeting + Net Worth + FIRE:**

This is where the fun begins. All spreadsheet tabs are now applicable, everything above is still applicable. The new additions are ""SWR"" and the final third of the Dashboard. If you've completed all the steps above, you're pretty much done save for a few manual inputs.

""Dashboard"": First, in the Dashboard, update your Withdrawal Rate, Age, and the Return Rate - return rate is just the amount after inflation that you believe the total stock market will, on average, return. By default, I've set this value to 7% as the average return of the market is 10% before inflation. Scroll down your Dashboard to see more FIRE metrics such as % until FIRE and the total net worth amount you would need to cover your average yearly expenses (boring note about this formula: >!the average spend calculations take your spending from ""Out"", average them not including zeroes, and mutliplies by 12. This means that if you had unusually high spending in a category (in my example, I had 1 monthly expense of over $600 for medical), it will take $600 \* 12 = an average of $7200 per year. Because of this, the NW number you need to cover all expenses may be inflated. Consider it a ""worst-case scenario"" table and don't put too much stock in the ""Needed"" number for unusually high expenses.!<)

""SWR"": The first table shows annual withdrawals based on your current Net Worth and selected withdrawal rate (Dashboard), if it were to be left alone, until a certain age (Y axis) and at a certain average total stock market return (X axis). There is 1 manual input for this chart: F1. If you want to view what your annual withdrawals could be at a certain age and at a certain stock return rate, type ""\[Age\] @ \[Return Rate\]%"" and the cell underneath will automatically pull the number. In the next table, you see the % you are under you've reached CoastFI for your LeanFIRE, FIRE, and FatFIRE numbers at a certain age (Y axis). There are 2 potential manual inputs here: cells H2 and J2. Currently, H2 is your LeanFIRE number and I've just calculated it as 2/3 of your FIRE number. The FatFIRE number is just 1.5x bigger than your FIRE number. You can change them manually if you want. Finally, the table next to that shows the monthly amount you would need to contribute to your Net Worth to reach your numbers at a certain age. Additional manual inputs for the table include your overall portfolio stock allocation, bond allocation, and the rate at which you expect bonds to increase in value.

&#x200B;

**Extras**:

I've also thrown in an amortization schedule (designed for a 30-year mortgage but adjustable to fit your needs, be it a car loan or student loan etc). At the top you can input your loan's terms. On the right half of the spreadsheet, you can see what happens to the loan if you pay extra that month. At the very end of the spreadsheet is a free math section. Just a blank sheet in case you want to do random calculations.

&#x200B;

Critiques and questions are welcome!

P.s. a common critique is that the Out page is inconvenient to update. Here's my recommendation, and what I did for my personal sheet. Create a google form. Put all of your categories into it as a multiple choice question. Short answer question for amount. Save the google form as a bookmark. Use that google form whenever you have an expense, and set the ""Out"" tab to automatically pull data from the form answer database using sumifs formulas (if date from google form = date in ""out,"" if category in google form = category in ""out,"" then sum) formulas.",financialindependence

- Quit smoking in August of 2015 at 26 years of age. 

- Went for about 6 months of spending what ever I wanted because I had so much extra money .

- December of 2015 decided to take health to next level and started to diet. Down 60 pounds to 195. I am 6'2'. One pound away form Normal BMI. That's what prompted me to write this. 

- January of 2016 got a new job. Pay went from $33,000 a year to $43,000. 

- After my 6 months of spending crazy decided that was dumb and wanted to start saving. I was always decent with money, and knew about this mind set but really took the dive in April of 2016.

My plan was simple, to take $400 of my paycheck, and $400 of my wife's paycheck, every single paycheck and start paying towards debt. She makes around $32,000 a year. I talked with her and she was on board. I was always in charge of the money and told her it wouldn't be hugh differences, just simple less spending of money on shit we don't need.  The only other thing we do towards FI besides house payments is I put 20% toward 401K with 7% on top from employer, and wife puts 6% with 3% on top from employer. 

When we started this journey, money specific, back in April '16 we had $31,000 of Student Loan/Car loan debt. Today we are at $9000 of consumer debt. Goal is to have that paid of by October 1st. We will then move to our mortgage of $68,000, and hope to be done with that by April of 2020. 

That's where we started and that's our big mid term goal. We are also running our first half marathon together in June. We rode a century ride last June. And I plan on training for an iron man for next year. Combined my wife and I have already lost over 100 pounds and are still working at the last 40. 

This subreddit was an inspiration. Not my only source of motivation but was a big help and still it's pushing us forward each day hearing stories of people FI and RE. Don't know if early RE is super important for us, my wife says she wants to work forever, so maybe just early RE for me. I don't know what the future holds but I do know that the path we are on today is much brighter because of FI.",financialindependence
620,How an extravagant car set me on the path to financial independence,,1272,j4ptih,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j4ptih/how_an_extravagant_car_set_me_on_the_path_to/,1601771054.0,"I should start by saying that I am not financially independent.  I'm happily on my way, but not there yet.  I thought this post might be an interesting insight into how something generally considered to be amongst the worst uses of money... a *new* (gasp!) *luxury* (cringe!) *vehicle* (faint!) actually wound up being a good thing for me.

So how on earth did something so universally vilified within FIRE circles actually work out in my favor?

First, a little background.  I grew up in a ""wealthy"" middle class family but had relatively little financial education.  My parents made sure to educate us on the perils of things like credit card debt (""if you pay it off in full each month, it's a free loan.  If you don't, it's tremendously expensive""), but beyond that, there wasn't much (no investing/budgeting/tracking spending).  If we're being totally honest, I would classify my family as ""big income, big spenders"" as typified in The Millionaire Next Door.  (I am by no means trying to disparage my parents or my otherwise exceptionally privileged upbringing, just making an observation about how money was treated growing up.)

I attended the US Air Force Academy for college, which was an excellent financial decision as luck would have it.  I got a world-class education for no money (though you do pay in other ways).  I had a stable, guaranteed income for the next 10 years of my life (after pilot training).  No debt.  Various tax-free allowances.  Free socialized healthcare.  And a less-known perk of the military called a ""career starter loan""--a 5 year loan of \~$30k at a low interest rate (usually \~1%).  I invested some of mine (haphazardly at the advice of some USAA financial advisors), used some for a down payment on a new car (no, not the car referenced in the title...just wait), and loaned some to my siblings to help them through college.  This is all relevant because...

Once I graduated, had my incredibly stable income via the military, and monthly payments to make on both my car and paying off the loan, I realized that I *hated* having monthly payments.  I paid both off ahead of schedule.  Even though the loan \*on paper\* is something I should not have paid off ahead of time (it's pretty easy to beat 1% interest in the stock market)...but I just hated knowing that bill was due.

Fast forward another year and I find myself developing a mild interest in ""affordable"" sports cars (mustangs and the like).  I'm a pilot, so I like to think I have an appreciation for high-performance things, even if I'm not particularly a ""gear head.""  So 25 year old me is researching these cars, and there's one catch.  Fuel. Efficiency.  I'm very much an environmentalist and the prospect of getting a coupe or sedan with less than 30 miles/gallon fuel economy was just unacceptable, regardless of how nice the car is.

Enter [this comic by The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s).  That was it.  Game over.  Checkmate.  You're telling me I can have the acceleration of a sports car, the practicality of a 4 door family sedan, the safety of a tank, all with a pittance of the pollution produced by a gas guzzler?  Count me in.  There was just one little catch...those things are expensive.  Real expensive.  And remember the part about me hating to have monthly payments for things?  I was not about to have a monthly car payment equivalent to a mortgage.

So there was only one thing to do:  start saving.  My Tesla goal, in conjunction with a hatred of debt, got me to start saving quite early in my career.  I started with $500/month...enough to buy a Model S in cash after *just* 10 years.  But 10 years is a long time, and I found that I really didn't notice my extra savings impacting my lifestyle.  So $500/month became $500/paycheck, which became $750/paycheck and continued to grow from there.  I intended to pay cash for that thing when I finally had enough.  So, **the first thing that car did was get me to start saving early in my career and at a much higher rate than I would have otherwise, because I had a goal.**  Not the most financially savvy goal, but I was saving quite a bit anyway.

Next, somewhat fortunately, I had a general intuition that my .01% interest savings account wasn't a great place to keep my money, and I had gleaned some basic knowledge of the stock market through coworkers.  I knew that with a long enough time horizon market risk was lower, and that there was at least an opportunity to make some extra cash.  I also figured that even if I did poorly, it would just mean a little be more time driving my perfectly serviceable Hyundai Elantra (great car, btw).  So I started throwing my monthly savings into an individual brokerage account.  I didn't have the knowledge about index funds I do now, but fortunately my stock picks weren't bad either.  In the end, I essentially matched the S&P 500.  The takeaway here, however, is that **my ridiculous car goal also got me started investing my money.** **because I was already saving and my time horizon was long enough to stomach market variance.**

A byproduct of my investing was that I also had regular conversations with coworkers about investing/personal finance.  I wasn't confident enough to dispense advice, but I enjoyed banter about what stocks people liked, how company X was doing on a given day, etc.  Enter a man named John, who mentioned that I should check out a blog called Mr. Money Mustache.  I must admit I dismissed it at first, strictly based on the name...but his stance on bicycles (ironic, given overarching subject of this post) was what sucked me in.  Then I read [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) and my whole world paradigm changed.  I suddenly gained direction in my life.  Instead of some nebulous concept of working until 65 and then figuring out some form of retirement, I had concrete dollar amount to strive for.  I cut my spending way back, generally grew happier, and greatly accelerated my savings (no longer with the solitary goal of affording that Tesla model S).  **And thus I landed on the path to FI, all from the humble beginnings of trying to buy a car.**

Some of you, especially those familiar with MMM, may now be wondering if I wound up following through with buying that *new, expensive, luxury depreciation-mobile.*  The remainder of that story goes like this:  my goal swapped from a model S to a model 3, as it met my expectations at a more moderate price point than the S.  I put down a day 1 reservation around the time I started reading MMM.  When I was finally notified that I could order one (about 2 years later), I had read quite a number of blog posts from reputable sources vilifying such purchases.  Was I really willing to throw 1/5 of my net worth into something that frivolous?  Could I delay my retirement timeline by about 1 year of savings?  Conversely, was I willing to let go of a goal I'd worked toward for over half a decade? And a chance to support a company doing incredible good for the environment and climate change?  Ultimately...

I did it.  Some things are worth more than cutting a little bit of time off of my retirement timeline.  Like occasionally supporting good companies, decreasing my carbon footprint, and the most utterly absurd and wonderful car I could ever imagine.  I don't regret it (though I'll definitely look to the used electric car market in the future, once enough time has passed for that to be a thing.)

TL;DR:  Young adult starts saving for a Tesla early in his career and happens to stumble into FI circles.

622,I was unemployed for two months. It affirmed my desire to FIRE.,,1278,iej9w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iej9w2/i_was_unemployed_for_two_months_it_affirmed_my/,1598106083.0,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share some of my experiences after a brief period of unemployment.

First some background, starting with where my mind was at. I had been working for an engineering company for 4 years and methodically contributing to my accounts in pursuit of FIRE, but I had certain concerns about it on my mind. Sometimes it would be demoralizing to run the numbers and see that FIRE was years off. Sometimes it even felt like it consumed my identity. Like it had become my ambition to watch numbers become bigger on a computer screen, instead of having an enriching career. I say this even as someone who made a conscious effort to try not to worry about it too much and enjoy my precious youth. I have continued to develop strategies to keep my attention on the present and enjoying my youth now.  I also had concerns if I would be able to be happy in a life without work when I did reach the ability to FIRE.

In June I was dismissed from my job. What followed has, in my view, given me the confidence and assuredness to continue on this path. At the time, I was 28 and I had 80k in retirement accounts, 22k cash, and 34k in the stock market, rented a home, and had absolutely zero debt. 

There are two distinct components I’d like to talk about. The first part of my satisfaction in pursuing FIRE was that I was enormously grateful I had made the choice to save money over the years. From day one, the pressure to resurrect my income was low because I had such a cushion to fall on. Many times over the years I had put money away instead of spending it on toys or even buying myself lunch thinking, “There may come a day when I wish I had held onto this money for a rainy day.” Decisions like that compounded. It’s clear that one of the benefits of FIRE is the freedom that comes even while still pursuing it. However I cannot deny that the additional $600 per week benefit due to the Covid situation was also well-timed and hugely alleviating. I also live with my girlfriend who pays 33% of the home expenses and, given that she is still working from home, could take on more if the situation deteriorated.  Not to mention the stock market exploded.  I admit, I was fortunate in many of my circumstances. 

The second component is how I spent the two months: My days were often spent waking up at 7 am (much improved from 5 am when I was working), prepping breakfast for my girlfriend, listening to political talk radio until 9 am, walking and training my German Shepherd until 10 am, reading books and drinking coffee until noon, using the hot afternoons to go to the gym, clean the house, comfort my girlfriend more as she worked, and then read more. I went for runs at sundown. I researched day-hikes that we could do on the weekend. Sprinkled in there were job applications which ultimately led to me getting a new job in the same area. Therefore, no move will be required. I recognize that here too, I’m very fortunate.  

While unemployed, I parted with some money to get some festering problems fixed. I spent $800 to fix my car’s cooling system and now it runs beautifully.  Parting with this much money may be counter to the frugality that unemployment should inspire. But the way I saw it, now I had the time to negotiate with mechanics around town, and get the car fixed up and properly running before the next phase of my life. Not to mention that FIRE again help yield the extra cash that could be expended on these necessities. No longer have to worry about a nuclear meltdown on my car. 

The point is that I felt very satisfied with this lifestyle, not trapped in a hell of purposelessness.  I feel regenerated and rested. Mentally stimulated from all the reading I did. Productive for up-keeping on the house, training my dog, and getting my car fixed. 

Maybe I’m wrong in this assessment of how things happened. But its made me feel much more assured in my pursuit of this financial security and prospect of being able to stop working. I’ll continue to relish my youth while I have it, but I feel more comfortable than before that the pursuit of FIRE gives me the safety net to absorb hardship along the way, and will give me the lifestyle that I want on the distant horizon.

As a final note, the week after I was released from my job I found a kitten in the road that needed $300 in vet care.  FIRE also allows you absorb the expenses of those who need your help.",financialindependence

Because the oldest was no longer mowing our own lawn, her then 10 year old sister mowed our lawn and was able to contribute $150 into her own Roth IRA.


I overheard them grumbling about the upcoming lawn season so I put an excel spreadsheet together which used random market returns between 5 and 9% (conservative and adjusted for inflation) and showed them how much money their accounts would be worth at different ages - if they left it alone, if they contributed the same amount each year - if they gradually climbed to the max - etc.


Their eyes lit up.  They are excited.  I'm a realist.  I know that they will still grumble and that there will be points where they simply don't want to get out of bed to work but I also know that they know why they're doing it and know they can get out of the race.

While it’s true that I crossed $2.25M, I’m not actually retiring. 

I’ve been with my current company for over 7 years, and have been pretty bored and unhappy for at least the last 3 of that. I had long ago set a goal of wanting to some day retire on $70k at a 3% WR, and as I’ve been inching toward that number I kept wondering if I’d pull the trigger. The realization that I finally came to months ago was that I couldn’t separate whether I was unhappy working altogether, or just unhappy in my current role. So I went about interviewing, which took way more effort than I expected, and after a number of ego-reducing rejections finally landed something that seems like a fit. The money is actually a slight reduction from where I’m at today, which took some mental energy to get over, but this sub was actually instrumental in making me realize that my pursuit of FIRE is meant exactly to let me do this sort of thing. 

So there you have it. I’m waiting for my background check to complete, which should hopefully be today or tomorrow, and then I’ll be submitting my notice. Sometimes things do work out.  

Oh, and one last thing. Part of what really pushed me over the edge and made me start applying for jobs is my dislike of my boss. Well, after what felt like way too long of living under his tyranny, he got fired on Tuesday. The universe is a funny place. Once I learned that I considered staying for about a microsecond, then realized that all of my other reasons for leaving are still valid. I’ll just consider his exit a parting gift from the company.

627,Were you happier before discovering FIRE? Ignorance is bliss? Feeling like my obsession with FIRE and money has taken over my life.,,1263,kzma15,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kzma15/were_you_happier_before_discovering_fire/,1610941189.0,"TL;DR - My motivation to FIRE has taken over my life to the point where I'm having a hard time enjoying spending my money or the simple joys and journey of life because I see every decision as either helping or harming my ability to FIRE.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

I discovered FIRE about 2-3 years ago after a friend posted an article to a blog post from Millenial Revolution. Luckily enough, I had made some of the right decisions already (i.e. paid off my student loans, contributed to 401k up to match), but after I discovered FIRE and calculated that I could retire early in 7 years, I started to aggressively save, dumped every spare dollar into index funds, and lowered all my expenses.

I hit $500K in net worth last month and it was a satisfying number to look at, yet as I was scrolling through old photos of myself from 5-7 years ago, I realized I wasn't necessarily happier for it. Over the past 2 years, I realized I've become more annoyed with work, and paralyzed or fearful of making any decisions that jeopardize my ability to FIRE. In the past, I would happily book an expensive, peak-season flight to an international country, buy a new camera just because I wanted it and I would be driven and motivated at work, exhibiting all the behaviors I needed to land that next promotion.

But since discovering FIRE, I haven't taken any international trips, haven't bought anything that's expensive yet could further my hobbies or interests (e.g. new camera for photography, roof rack for car), and outright stopped caring about work to the point where my attitude towards it has become bitter and resentful. I figure if I just coast at my job for the next few years, I'll hit my FIRE goal within 5-7 years. But it is actually out of character for me to care so little about my career and feel so apathetic. My coworkers are pretty surprised and baffled at my apathy towards work.

I'm seeing every single decision I make is either for or against achieving FIRE. Have a baby? But that might push out my FIRE date. Buy a house? It would be a dumb decision in NYC based on all the blog posts I've read. Hold a wedding? How many more years will I need to work? Buy a new laptop? But that's $XXXXX lost if I invested it in the market instead. Get a new job? Why bother, I just need to suck it up for 5 more years. Etc. Etc.

Now I'm wondering if I would've been happier if I didn't discover FIRE at all... If I was ignorant? I see some friends who have no idea what FIRE is happily enjoying their money and their life and I am jealous of them. I feel like it's become a mental restraint I've placed on myself. And these next 5 years feel like they're going to be pretty miserable until I can hit my FIRE #.

Any suggestions on how to break out of this mindset would be appreciated!",financialindependence

I’m using a baby account for this because anonymous isn’t quite anonymous enough as nobody outside my family knows, really.

I’ve technically been FI for about 8 years. I didn’t have any plans to retire insanely early and was using my degrees and working in software (big surprise lol). I honestly didn’t learn of the whole FIRE movement until about the time I retired.

I retired in 2nd quarter of 2018 at 36. It wasn’t intentional. A lot had gone on in my family and my company was going through another big change cycle (My team had turned over 3x and management 5x in the 5 years I was there), I was overwhelmed and burnt out. I had a month-long trip planned for Nov. of that year and thought the summer/fall would be a nice break. I put in my two weeks planning to just putter around and focus on my mental health until that trip.  I had fully planned to start job searching upon my return.

I did not start job searching upon my return. I figured I’d enjoy the holidays as hiring is slow then anyway and start job searching in January. Cue more family stuff happening so I decided to wait a bit longer and had another month-long trip planned in April so figured I’d just wait.  I actually ended up purchasing a house and started renovations before I left for my trip.

I returned from said trip and I did not start job searching. I think the reality was that I had no desire to go back to the 9-5 grind. I decided to focus on the house and moving. I finally moved and took time to enjoy my new house.

Heading towards the latter part of last year, I started feeling like I was missing something. I didn’t want to start applying for career jobs in my field as I planned to continue longer travels a few times a year (hahahahaha) and the thought of going back to the everyday stress and drudgery was too much.  I thought about signing up with a temp agency or finding somewhere to volunteer on a more regular basis but didn’t make much of my thoughts as it was holiday time once again and figured the new year might bring some inspiration.

In Feb. I got in a quick trip and was supposed to be leaving shortly after for 6 weeks of travel but all hell broke loose. I know the state of the world the last 6 months is probably amplifying things (and I do want to state that I know I’m actually insanely lucky to be in the situation I am with everything), but the feelings of just sort of floating around predate all of that.

Looking at the timeline described here, it seems like there was a fair amount happening, and there was, but without a job the time between big events just sort of is. I haven’t felt passionate enough to stick to any long term projects and filling the days with random activities becomes really unfulfilling after awhile.

I guess after writing all of this, the advice of make sure you retire to something is very valid. I didn’t plan on retiring so I also didn’t plan what that would look like for the next several decades or even few years. That feels like a bit of a mistake.

Editing to add - it’s a very weird place to feel incredibly free like you could do anything and still stagnant and unable to decide what that thing is.

I’m happy to answer any questions and an open to any and all advice!

I live with no other humans and one assholish but adorable doge if that matters.

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this many responses.

Adding as it’s come up in a few of the comments I’ve seen. I do see a psychiatrist/therapist for anxiety/OCD and insomnia (nothing physically wrong, had sleep issues since my early teens).  I don’t really fit diagnostic criteria for depression, though covid is causing something in a lot of people.

Also, it’s not a lack of happiness, it’s a lack of direction and, to me, there’s a huge difference between the two. I’m not unhappy. Just aimless.

Edit 2 - wow this blew up overnight. I never expected so much response. I’m trying to read through and respond to questions

A couple of points
- am female (not surprising as I didn’t mention in the OP and this sub skews very male)

629,"Why do most people manage their money efficiently in video games, but do the exact opposite in real life?",,1264,6muq5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6muq5b/why_do_most_people_manage_their_money_efficiently/,1499873859.0,"There was a post on r/showerthoughts recently where a redditor observed that if they handled their real-life money the way they did in video games, they'd be a millionaire by now. Of course on /r/financialindependence we know this to be true: if you earn a median wage and manage your money correctly, you will indeed become a millionaire. And yet, so few people actually *do* this. I find this to be a really interesting dichotomy because it isn't at all obvious why this happens, and if we knew how to help people think of real-life finances the way they think of in-game finances, it could do a lot of good for their financial health.


Most gamers, when presented with a choice of what to purchase in a game, naturally look for items that generate more future income. In Starcraft or other real-time-strategy games we buy workers who increase our income, in EVE or other MMOs we increase our earning capacity or buy sources of passive income. 

If you tell a video game player that they can purchase something that will earn them exponentially increasing passive income, forever, they would gravitate to that as their first choice. Those same people are probably putting off paying down debt or investing in real life.


In RPGs we conserve money and items to the point of vastly over-saving. Who hasn't completed a long RPG with a massive ""emergency fund"" of money and potions against a possible future need? But in real life, those very same people who hoard potions and gold in Final Fantasy will blow all their money on fancy cars, take out, or whatever (as we all have done at some point). I would say the average adult gamer probably has an emergency fund that is not significantly better, income-adjusted, than average, even though they clearly understand the importance and value of having one when they play a video game (where the stakes are lower!)

**What are the key differences that make the same person save and invest in a video game, but be a spendthrift in real life?**

Is it that real life is full of marketing? That financial options for investing and saving in real life are more difficult to understand? That the short-term dopamine rush of luxury purchases in real life doesn't really exist in most video games?",financialindependence

632,Easing into a simpler life after Covid...,,1253,ilw5mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ilw5mp/easing_into_a_simpler_life_after_covid/,1599148655.0,"Can anyone relate to this?

I’m in my late 30’s, married, and a business owner. Just north of $1m in index funds saved and have a couple of years living expenses in cash. Was making about $300k yearly in a LCOL area. 

Pre-Covid, I put up a dramatic post about how I have been having mental breakdowns, my marriage is crumbling, all I do is work 24/7, and my life is miserable. I want more than anything to FIRE but should probably start COASTing so I don’t completely break down. 

Since then, my business had been mandated closed for over six months and is, just now, on the precipice of reopening. 

After six months of no-salary, reflecting, panicking, stressing, relaxing, and going through every emotion you can imagine, I have a new mindset. 

I could technically COAST right now and just earn living expenses for the next 15-20 years. We don’t spend frivolously, as evidenced by six months of a shutdown. I’m reopening my business now and it looks like I will be starting around $75-80k yearly, working a dramatically reduced scheduled. 

Before, I would have panicked at this, but I actually feel an ease at the idea that as long as I cover living expenses, my family and I will be ok. I will work on maximizing profit, inside my limited schedule only, and anything extra can always go into savings. Maybe I’ll be able to FIRE earlier than 15-20 years, who knows?! The whole situation plucked me from the rat race for a period of time and I just feel more relaxed and less pressure to SAVE SAVE SAVE EARN EARN EARN SAVE SAVE EARN EARN WORK NONSTOP WORRY WORRY SAVE EARN SAVE EARN

Simply, I was grinding myself to death, in an attempt to FIRE, and now I feel like I’d rather enjoy life a little bit. It’s a mental adjustment, but I’m starting to feel ok with it now. I was so wrapped up in money, that I forgot how nice it felt to sit down and eat dinner with my wife, go for a long walk, read a book, etc.

I also tend to see folks overemphasizing their suggested saving rates 'on topics like ""% of savings from net pay"" or ""budget based on this job/city"" 

While very few will get ahead with irrational spending, I think it's important to also invest in experiences that help you get ahead and conveniences that allow you to perform at your highest level. These are tertiary benefits to FI, but they can compound in a big way. 

A few examples that I find help me progress but are often viewed as contrarian here: 

1. Services and convenience to save time for higher-value activities:

\- Services like meal delivery/ kits, cleaning, labor or convenience of living in a downtown core are all expensive vs taking the bargain route, but the time/energy that these save allows you to focus energy on much higher value tasks.

This could mean working that extra hour or two, fitness, self-improvement, time with loved ones. We all have a finite time in life. If you can afford to optimize your time in a day, it's likely to pay off in the long run. 

2.   Experiences

\- It's expensive to take part in high-demand experiences (Vacations, Dinners out, Conferences, activities like skiing/Tennis/Golf), but if done in moderation, there are also key benefits. This is often where you can make connections with the network you need to move up in your career. This is the time you can take to justify working your ass off to make real $ vs a passive job with a mediocre income. While the end goal is FI, it's important to reward yourself along the way to continue working hard.

3. Buying High Quality

\- This is a tricky one as there's a fine line between needs vs wants, but buying higher-quality often leads to better results, satisfaction, longer-term use. I see this with posts about meal planning quite often. While it's certainly going to save $$ eating rice and basic protein hacks, the food you consume is the fuel you need to have your body and mind performing at top capacity. I'm not suggesting you need a steak dinner and essential supplements every day, but you pay for what you get when it comes to nutrition. 

\- Similar story with things like home appliances, car (if required), clothes etc etc. Don't always buy top of the line, but also think hard on the quality vs price point

Again, these all require moderation (particularly experiences), but they can also really help propel your career/business. Of course, everyone's situation is unique. If you're paying off debt, then the mindset of saving everything possible still likely applies.",financialindependence

Second, maybe someone more experienced than I can give me some pointers.

Full disclaimer, I'm don't consider myself to be an expert at investing or finance.

**Background**

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, lower-middle class. Mom was a single mother of three. No inheritance, no money for allowance. I jut had to get a job if I wanted money. So I did. I was always fascinated by technology so I ended up eventually landing a job at a laptop repair store after working various other jobs from lawn care to restaurants.

I think my mother did a remarkable job and prioritizing where her limited budget went. We always had quality food to eat, we were always warm, and we all had the opportunity to pursue higher-education; a privilege I will forever be grateful for. We still had to pay for it later but she made sure we knew it was an option.

I went to college and ended up getting a job in Software Development.

___
**Notes on Expenses**

I have always been shocked by the few colleagues I know who are living paycheck to paycheck. It absolutely amazes me how a single person with no dependents in the technology industry could possibly manage to spend all that money. Most people just have a bloated expectation of what they need to be happy.

Some months I live off less than $1,000 for the whole month but I don't feel like I am living an abnormally frugally lifestyle. Some months I spend more like $1,500. Last month I spent a little under $1,200.

Here is a list of things that I have found to be incredibly helpful for me:

* **Food:** The vast vast majority of the eating I do is food that I have cooked at home or food from work. In addition to being expensive, the food is just terrible for you when you eat out. I also don't eat meat so I don't really have a lot of options for eating out; particularly where I live. My food and beverage budget would probably be far lower if I didn't go out for drinks so much. I value social time and I enjoy drinking.
* **Transportation:** I ride my bike to work. The metro system is also quite good where I live and it's only about a buck to ride it as far as you want. If the metro doesn't run where I need to go, Uber is also quite cheap.
* **Work Perks:** I take full advantage of every perk my work has to offer. We have catered lunch and free self-serve breakfast. We have free coffee and beer. It always blows my mind when people go out to eat anyway. My work allows me to expense my cell phone bill. If I work asks me to expense something, I gladly do it so I can get cash back on my credit card. Last month, I expensed 5 laptops for my team and got $180 in travel credit on my Chase Reserve card.
* **Research:** When I do decide to buy something, I actually do some research instead of just dropping and absurd amount on the first deal that comes along. When I was paying for my cell phone bill last year, I ended up signing up for Google Fi and paying like $35-50 a month internationally by just not using a ton of data while no on WiFi networks. Really not that hard of a habit to get into. On the topic of research, I would also note that well-research and cheap aren't always hand-in-hand. I would rather buy one good jacket that lasts me five years than 5 shit ones that last me one year each.
* **Accommodations**: I rent flats with other people. I enjoy living with others. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* **Credit Card Perks**: I only buy things on credit cards and pay them off at the end of every month. It's free money. A lot of credit cards also have other great perks that saves you even more money like free food in airports.
* **Location:** I have found living out of the country to be cheaper but not that much cheaper where I live. I'm in one of the more expensive area in South America. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* I found that selling all my stuff when I left the United States really helped me break out of a consumer mindset. I no longer mindlessly buy material objects. When I buy things, I ask myself the following questions:
   * Is this object going to save me money? I have no issue buying a coffee maker for $100 or even $300 is it means I'm not going buy coffee everyday at Starbucks. I have no issue buying a more expensive laptop if it's going to increase my productivity at work and lead to more money.
   * Is this object going to raise my standard of living in a way I care about? For me these are things like a decent quality produce, a yoga mat, a good jacket, bed, or office chair.
   * Is this object going to stimulate my brain? For me these are things like books, art, classes, and music. You'll notice that I have a whole category in my expenses for continued education. That's because it's a thing of value to me.
   * Is this object going to improve my relationship with people I care about? For me this includes things like going out for drinks. Social interaction is important to me.
   * Is this a hobby or passion that truly makes me happy? I have been a long-time skateboarder and, if my skateboard breaks, I will buy a new one without even thinking about it. Instead of having a ton of hobbies that I am sort-of into I have a few hobbies that I am really into.

I don't think these guidelines are for everyone. Maybe not even for the majority of people. My point is that, if you can identify what's important to you, then you can set rules that you can use to determine how/when you want to spend your money.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this stuff because it's incredibly interesting to me.
___
**Regrets & Staying the Course**

Everyone just wants to get rich quick. At one point I was up to $60k in crypto. Now I have less than $20k. I play poker games. I put money into individual stocks even though I hardly know what I am doing. Deep down I know that my best chance is staying the course. As you can see from my monthly plan, I am still planning on diversifying into these other high-risk areas a bit but I'm not going to let it ruin my chances of an almost sure-thing. Remember, there's a reason this approach is so popular. It's because it works.
___
**Final Words**

The last thing I want to touch on here is around depression. I know a lot of us are in offices. I sit in one every day and I see what it does to people. Instead of looking towards a future where we don't let money guide our decisions, we need to remember that we are in control of our decisions now. It doesn't have to suck along the way and this goal isn't worth your mental and physical well-being. Don't be afraid to make a change. You can take a pay cut to get out of a situation you hate or completely pivot your career without giving up this dream. Don't be afraid to alter your plan in exchange for a healthy mental state.

636,"FIRE: 1 year in, a few reflections",,1253,b2bfko,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b2bfko/fire_1_year_in_a_few_reflections/,1552864799.0,"My background: I’m a scientist in my mid 40’s who got into the big data side of tech just as it took off. I worked for a few large companies, and a few small companies, both as an FTE and consultant. During one of my “no job, no consulting” periods in the late fall (notoriously hard time to find a new job as everyone is on vacation, spent their budgets, etc.) I fell deep into the bitcoin rabbit hole researching what it was, what it might become etc. I bought in a few times and sold my holdings last December (not at the peak, but close) for about 1.5M. I had saved a shit-ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I never spend other than buying/fixing up my house. The FIRE idea was natural to me – I had an instinctual aversion to debt, simple tastes, and grew up without a lot (but didn’t feel like that was an issue). My job was not really going in a direction I liked, and I had just cashed over a million post-tax cryptobucks so I quit. I figured I’d try being unemployed, maybe call it “semi-retirement”? With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had close to 4M. 

**Reflection 1:   I didn’t know what to do with myself, but I got plenty of sleep**

It was spring. I rode my bike and forgot what day it was. I cleaned up my garage (finally!) and stayed up as late as I needed to based on what I was working on at the time. I got a few phone calls from people who knew I left my job, asking me if I wanted to work with/for them. No thanks. I had my old job call me and ask if I’d consider working in a different department on some (truly cool) new problems. Nope. Two months in I got two calls from old workmates asking me to come be their boss after some re-org. I’m flattered but Hell No. For my ego, that was nice. I had no desire at that point to do any work of any kind. I just wanted to play. A year later and I have a bit more structure, but it’s still pretty loose. 

**Reflection 2: I wasn’t sure how I’d deal with the stock market behaving poorly**


This was originally a ""theoretically speaking"" type of question I had. Well, 2018 blew that shit right up. We know the stock market didn’t do much last year from a YoY POV. As a person who tracks net worth each month, it was rough to see such large fluctuations. What a great way to see if I can hack this lifestyle. There was a brief period when I felt a bit off about what I was doing, but then I did the math again for the 300th time and learned to breathe deeply. In the end there was no panic, and I think I have a thicker skin because of the bullshit we endured (and yes, that might just be the canary in the coal mine). Just hang on tight.

**Reflection 3: Not having a regular income stream makes managing money different**

One of the things that has gotten me the most twisted is failing to have a large pool of instant liquidity at hand. I have not really needed it, but it’s weird to see only a couple grand in the bank. I want my money working for me, but I want to be able to make quick economic decisions at times. I used to just let my bank account grow and then shift money every so often out into investments. Now that flow is reversed and it feels really weird. I’m still not quite where I want to be – waiting on a dividend payment to shift the money around, some into a cash cushion. 

I also did not spend much last year. I was really price conscious (spent 2% instead of 3.5% allotted) and while I didn’t scrimp exactly, I also did not relax about the money. I’m working on that, much like learning to not work all the time. I keep telling myself - it’s not about the money anymore, it’s about the experience. If I want it, I should take it, because I can based on the decisions I have made, and Fate’s kindly ass-pats along the way. Quit getting twisted about the price of the thing you want on the menu. I can’t help it after being so broke for so many years in my youth/early adulthood. 
 
**Reflection 4: I might want to take on some work**

In the last two weeks I have talked with a friend about starting a small company and one of my long past jobs contacted me for some creative design consulting work. I’m considering both and it really isn’t about the money – it’s about the adventure. The rate I will quote that old job will be steep, and if they balk at it then I will walk 100%. I’ve never been in that position before. I miss engaging my brain in the way I did at work – lots of moving parts, people, processes. It’s hard to find analogues outside of the employment game.  Maybe I should help a political cause I care about – maybe they could put me to work in a fulfilling way. Not sure. 

That’s my 1 yr set-o-reflections – my house is clean, Goodwill inherited 15% of my accumulated stuff, the yard looks good, my bike is ready for Spring, I didn’t lose any weight yet (well, I yo-yo’d), I’m taking music lessons FINALLY, and I read more than I used to. 

Happy to answer any questions.

Anyone who can achieve stable employment can, theoretically, achieve FIRE - but most don't.

I just came across this long article on the subject - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/

The author lists 20 ""flaws, biases, and causes of bad behaviour"". Any resonate with you - it certainly made me pat myself on the back a few times, which makes me suspect there's a few here that I'm just currently blind to in my own life!?

1. Earned success and deserved failure fallacy: A tendency to underestimate the role of luck and risk, and a failure to recognize that luck and risk are different sides of the same coin.

2. Cost avoidance syndrome: A failure to identify the true costs of a situation, with too much emphasis on financial costs while ignoring the emotional price that must be paid to win a reward.

3. Rich man in the car paradox. (You don't admire the man, you think people would admire you if you were the man.)

4. A tendency to adjust to current circumstances in a way that makes forecasting your future desires and actions difficult, resulting in the inability to capture long-term compounding rewards that come from current decisions.

5. Anchored-to-your-own-history bias: Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

6. Historians are Prophets fallacy: Not seeing the irony that history is the study of surprises and changes while using it as a guide to the future. An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change is the lifeblood of progress.

7. The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.

8. Underappreciating the power of compounding, driven by the tendency to intuitively think about exponential growth in linear terms.

9. Attachment to social proof in a field that demands contrarian thinking to achieve above-average results.

10. An appeal to academia in a field that is governed not by clean rules but loose and unpredictable trends.

11. The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money; wealth is what you don’t see.

12. A tendency toward action in a field where the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.

13. Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally and physically.

14. A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.

15. An attachment to financial entertainment due to the fact that money is emotional, and emotions are revved up by argument, extreme views, flashing lights, and threats to your wellbeing.

16. Optimism bias in risk-taking, or “Russian Roulette should statistically work” syndrome: An over attachment to favorable odds when the downside is unacceptable in any circumstance.

17. A preference for skills in a field where skills don’t matter if they aren’t matched with the right behavior.

18. Denial of inconsistencies between how you think the world should work and how the world actually works, driven by a desire to form a clean narrative of cause and effect despite the inherent complexities of everything involving money.

19. Political beliefs driving financial decisions, influenced by economics being a misbehaved cousin of politics.

20. The three-month bubble: Extrapolating the recent past into the near future, and then overestimating the extent to which whatever you anticipate will happen in the near future will impact your future.

tldr from the author: ""If there’s a common denominator in these, it’s a preference for humility, adaptability, long time horizons, and skepticism of popularity around anything involving money. Which can be summed up as: Be prepared to roll with the punches.""",financialindependence

* A portion of my high-yield savings is allocated as a travel/vacation fund. It's very important to me. I make two separate transfers from my checking to my savings with each paycheck: 1 for emergency fund, 1 for vacation/travel. I keep track of the balances of each so I always know how much cash I have to take my next trip. This has made it much easier for me to justify travel expenses knowing I have already set the cash aside for just that. I have taken a few trips I never would have allowed myself to otherwise (I am very prudent with my spending).
* As things are now, I am on track to FIRE at 55, if I wish. It may not be the ""retire at 35 or 40"" I was dreaming of, but that's 10 YEARS I get to call my own.
* I am not as interested in RE as I am in FI. As you may note, I said I can retire at 55 if I wish. As things are right now, I'm not sure I would want to retire early. If I could choose to right now, I wouldn't. However, I do want that option in the back pocket and the peace of mind that my lifestyle can be paid for by the choices I made in my past. ""Fuck you"" money will also be nice too.

&#x200B;

Future plans:

* Find out what is the absolute largest portion of my income I can save and invest before it starts to hurt. I want to find out what that number is and update my figures accordingly.
* The most obvious way for me to expedite my FIRE journey is to increase my income. The most obvious way for me to increase my income is to further my education beyond an Associates Degree. So, I am currently starting the process of figuring out the what, when, and where of going back to school.
   * What: I am leaning towards just going back to get a general business degree. Maybe I will specialize in something as well, but I am still exploring options. After dropping out of university when I was 21, I realized engineering wasn't the right path for me. I still had interest in a STEM field and robotics felt right to me. However, now I am finding that it would be better for me to just have almost any degree rather than none if I want to find higher paying jobs at a different company. General business, to me, seems as universal as possible, moderately interesting to me, and not as crazy difficult as engineering was.
   * When: I'm thinking at the beginning of next year.
   * Where: This is where most of my decision making power is going right now. I have always dreamed of living in another country (preferably in a French-speaking part of the world) and would really love to go get a degree outside of the US. It is harder to get work in another country than it is to go study in one so I'm seeing this as an opportunity to get out there and do something very few people in my family have done: leave Texas. I think perhaps the most reasonable course of action would be to try and start part-time with online classes while continuing to work full-time at my current job. Then maybe I can transition into making a move somewhere to go full-time to finish the bulk of it.
* I have an interview scheduled soon for another robotics job here in Austin. I found out about it through my roommate, who knows someone who works there. I'm not putting any eggs in that basket just yet, but it has the potential for better pay and benefits. Currently, I don't get a retirement plan from my employer and no PTO.

So I hope this was at least interesting to read. I'd be happy to answer any questions you all may have. I would really appreciate any words of wisdom as well. This little community, while it has it's problems, has been really great for me to follow as it's helped me steer my life the way I want it.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: Obligatory ""this got way more attention than I expected"". But seriously, thank you all for the comments! It's been interesting reading them and some of you are very nice. I would like to point out one thing though that I probably should have mentioned in the post: I don't love my job and frankly not even sure I like the industry I'm in that much. Don't get me wrong, there are times where I'm really glad I went this route but often times I find myself thinking 'I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life.' Also, I have tried programming multiple times (which I realize has pretty huge earning potential) mainly in school, some on my own, and it just hasn't really done it for me. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but I'm pretty sure it's not my thing and if it doesn't light a fire in me then I don't want to force myself into it for the money. I have been working at this job for about 1.5 years now and started out with building and wiring the machines our company designed and now am more into mechanical design and have been involved in a number or internal R&D for machines my company is trying to create. Mechanical design is something I'm fairly good at and like it alright, but again not sure about a long term thing. I'm interested to look for other jobs to try similar work and see if maybe part of it is just the company culture and the people. Hope that adds a bit more understanding to my current situation.",financialindependence

This is the other side of financial independence. A good number of people have FIRE dreams because they're working at a job they hate. As an alternative to retiring once you reach your SWR and pursing hobbies/passion projects, might I suggest looking for a different, more personally amenable career? We all want to help people in one form or another with the limited hours we have each day; rather than turning off the money spigot outright, why not continue working somewhere else with the aim of donating the earned income to charity? This has three benefits: the first is that you're working at place that you want to work, the second is that explicitly working with the intent of furthering a charitable cause generates warm fuzzies, and the third is that you always have the option of stepping away from employment because you're already FI. In fact, you could even go one step further and work directly for a charity that is close to your heart; many of the skills gained in the corporate world [transfer over](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/#what-roles-are-there) to the non-profit sector, where they are [desperately needed](https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/#key-figures).

Here's my story:  


I was one of five children living with my mom who never graduated from high school. She was a waitress, worked in a store, did odd jobs. I was the youngest kid, and I remember being 12 years old when I got my first pair of shoes that were my very own new shoes, not hand me downs. I remember being arrested for shoplifting when I was 10, and how my mom broke down when she found out I had been stealing school supplies. She wanted us all to go to college. Most of us did. When I was in college on a scholarship, she finally graduated from high school by studying for and passing her GED. She got a job at the county as a clerk, which was the first stable job she ever had.

Two years after I got my Ph.D., I had a brand new townhouse built for her. She got to pick out the granite for the countertops and the fixtures for the bathrooms and the wall color.

When I sold that place later, I lost money, but honestly, fuck money when it comes down to it. It was the nicest place she ever lived in.",financialindependence

I Tell my salesman that I’m coming by at noon to pick up my new 2020 Z900. I sold my bike before I deployed and I’ve been itching to get another. Finally, I decided to take the plunge. I sent him pictures of my license info whatever he needed. At 9:53.... I’m laid off permanently. No furlough, just done. And then I’m humiliated by my boss escorting me to my desk to get my crap and leave. Then an hour later, I was called by my co worker and was told the same happened to him and two others. After it was all said and done, seven good people lost their jobs in an instant. No warning or indication. All company emails are saying how good the company is doing now and how much business we are booking. But all the answers we got during our separation was corporate restructuring. Now where am I going with this? I’m glad you asked.

I am currently not worried. Maybe a little? But I’m sleeping just fine knowing I have around a quarter million I can withdraw from. I know not everyone is as fortunate as me. There are so many families out there that are struggling because they have no savings or investments like many of us do in this community. I would be petrified if I was in that situation. 

The idea of financial independence is so powerful and I wish it was taught in the school system. Workers should not have to be so dependent on employers and get cast aside so easily. It’s BS. I know I’m not special by any means, but so many days I put in at the office and over time worked just to be cast out like garbage. It hurts bad. Overall, I’m just saying spread the message of financial independence. You could end up saving a family from extreme hardship. 

Thank you Warren Buffet for getting me into investing at 16 during the Great Recession. 

For the record, I’m just a customer service rep / inside sales... or was. Ironically enough, the wife’s last day of work was Friday as well. She’s going back to school to be an RN. Corona has inspired her to help people and I couldn’t be more proud.

Edit: lol no I did not end up getting the bike. I couldn’t justify it. I’ll get one when I start working again.

Edit2: I’m shocked this has blown up they way it has! Thank you everyone for the support. I believe in each and every one of you!

642,Inside the r/financialindependence Time Machine,,1238,kv2si9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kv2si9/inside_the_rfinancialindependence_time_machine/,1610372290.0,"I started writing this post to try and get my thoughts out, and also guide some of the newer members of the sub. Instead I went back through old posts and just pondered on how the sub had changed since it started.

First lets teleport back to 9 years ago, the world is falling apart due to the Arab spring, but Osama’s dead, the London Olympics is around the corner and the UK and US are looking like they are recovering, curiosity rover landed on mars. Around 1000 subscribers on the financialindependence sub:

The financial crisis is still ringing in the back of your head, you knew people who seemed well off who lost their jobs and houses, the job market has been shit for a while. My parents sold all their shares in 2008/2009 and had three 0% down repayment mortgages for example (it was common knowledge in 2006 that it was a guaranteed way to be rich, reminds me of tesla/bitcoin). However, green shoots have been spreading for a while, 2010 wasn’t too bad really, 2011 is going great. The market is still two thirds below 2008 levels.

You most probably read earlyretirementextreme or thesimpledollar, you most probably had read your money or your life, the millionaire next door or a random walk down wall street. You might have somehow found the bogleheads forum and got linked  through to reddit. I personally couldn’t find any of these resources and was looking at Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, Forex trading, buying houses etc.

So what are the main beliefs and thoughts? The main themes on the subreddit is sustainability, frugalness, being happier with less. I really think that’s a reflection of the time and points in a good way to survivorship bias. The best examples of people who had stayed the course were frugal and lived below their means, they had diversified assets. Index funds werent anywhere near as popular then either so it was much harder to not lose everything in the GFC, but some people were on the index fund train and were comfortable enough to power through. The only real way people could have done that is cut expenses and live within your means.

Heres some example posts. Note all the comments are about living happily with less.

Zoom forward a couple of years to joining at the start of 2015, the world isnt really falling apart yet until next year (BoJo and Trump arent taken seriously), uptown funk hit number 1, Game of Thrones anyone? I think this sub hit 100,000 subscribers around then:

The stock market is on an absolute tear, its finally surpassed its 2008 highs in 2014. The mood everywhere is pretty good, house prices have done very well in cities and recovered in most suburbs. The common person has started feeling ok about stocks again but has no idea what an index fund is, stocks are still considered pretty dangerous if you speak to your uncle. I distinctly remember reading lots of articles (maybe slightly earlier) that Amazon was a bad investment as it didn’t make profit, dividend paying stocks like utilities, oil and tobacco were the game of the day. I personally had made some disastrous plays into renewable energy stocks around 2014/15 as I was trying to be sustainable.

You definitely read mrmoneymustache, probably religiously. You probably post here and read some of the other various blogs in the side bar (frugalwoods, jlcollions, getrichslowly etc.). You may have found the sub through some kooky articles on CNBC or the BBC. The book selections havent really changed much at all.

Main conversation points? Frugality is still the name of the day. Living a happy and sustainable life. Riding bicycles everywhere and doing your own repairs. 4% rule is king. Some dissenting opinions are brewing about how incredulous it is to retire on $600,000, but the conversation is very polite. The veterans' portfolios are really starting to bear fruit and gain notoriety after investing through the downturn (or at least not selling and cutting down expenses).

I really enjoyed reading some of the top posts from this year.

/[u/rootofgoodblog](https://www.reddit.com/user/rootofgoodblog/) ‘s retirement announcement. Some disagreement about whether $32,000 was enough (spoiler, it was, maybe even too much so far) [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired\_at\_33\_with\_32000yr\_retirement\_budget\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1pq2dn/retired_at_33_with_32000yr_retirement_budget_me/)

Zoom forward to the present day. >800,000k subscribers, the world is falling apart again, WAP was number one for some reason:

10 plus years of constant returns, a flash crash near the start of the year scared the shit out of everyone for all of a month.  You probably know people not working now, but you’ve kept your job and also have saved extra this year. Your mate might even be sitting pretty on 5 bitcoins and some tesla stock. Instead of instilling fear the crash has instilled confidence. Every man and his dog has some ETF ‘Index’ funds. Turns out renewables and Amazon were the right call, go figure. Still, I have more money than the people at work bragging about bitcoin, not that I tell them. If I’d invested in index funds in 2011, not 2014/5, rather than a house, individual shares etc. I’d be richer. If I’d not invested in a second property after that I’d be a lot less stressed at the least.

More than likely you found the site through somebody linking through to the sub, it might have even popped up on your feed. Theres a plethora of blogs and youtube channels, you might listen to choosefi, but just as likely other investing podcasts. The dinosaur blogger portfolios have hit unimaginable heights. Mostly they seem pretty bored of blogging now and rarely post. You probably work in software, you really might just be browsing around and shaking your head at the incredible wealth, you might equally have come and cannot fathom why people think 10% returns are good, you might equally also think 4% of your portfolio sounds risky.

Conversation points now? Money is king. Lots more people that have stayed the course. It’s very common to be told that your portfolio isnt enough, its also pretty common to have to defend some luck you’ve had. A lot of portfolios are bitcoin and meme stocks, but still really the minority on this sub. I personally hide out in leanfire in my safe space.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c2fotn/unpopular\_opinion\_thread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c2fotn/unpopular_opinion_thread/) One of the most popular posts last year. Probably skewed by hitting the front page

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular\_opinion\_1m\_isnt\_a\_lot\_of\_money\_anymore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djpwll/unpopular_opinion_1m_isnt_a_lot_of_money_anymore/) By my reckoning that was about $870k in 2011. I’d like to think people were arguing about shiller cape ratios, but not really.  The estimates of FIRE have definitely ballooned.

Now what’s my point? My original thinking was to write this for my own benefit. But also just show people it’s important to run their own race and be nice to each other, but to also think in terms of decades rather than thinking in the present. It took 6 years for the stock market to recover in 2008, this time it took 6 months. So much happens, so many plans seem incredulous but work out, some people get lucky, some people don’t. The people that have stayed the course are more than likely frugal, more than likely good at sticking to an achievable plan, and more than likely good at tracking things so they can adjust quickly. However some people stayed rich from the 2000’s housing boom the same way some people will stay rich from bitcoin and the 1990s tech stock boom. This fact is not my problem, I have a plan and I’m sticking to it. I had to message my dad regularly in March not to sell, although thankfully this time he had a competent financial advisor that he actually listened to rather than his son.

Where will you be in 9 years? It’s good to think about that.

We are now ~seven years in (out of then-estimated 12 total) and decided to slow down: sold the rental units, paid off the personal mortgage (both financial 'mistakes' I'm very happy with) and am taking a more relaxed, surefire path to FI involving low (but comfortable) expenses, no rentals, and reducing work schedule.  Journey, thoughts, and numbers below.

Journey before destination.

#This is way longer than I intended; it also has all the info in it I enjoy hearing about other people’s FIRE journeys. . . sorry for the length.

###Background (Skip this if you want; I enjoy reading these, so I lay it out for others)

I had terrible money habits growing up: they continued until I was 26.  *Really* bad.  I grew up on foodstamps, and we never had *any* excess money; anything that came in went right back out on expenses.  I’d like to say they were necessities, but looking back. . . I think we could have done a lot better.  The scarcity mindset that living at the financial edge instills is real, and I continued to spend every dollar available to me (by work or by loan) until I stumbled across FIRE.  Constantly racked up credit card debt, and took every dollar that was ever available on student loans.

I regret taking the amount of student loans we did; we could have done less (though not anywhere near zero)  They say “That first 100K is hardest”, but it’s really that “That first 100K from *zero* is hardest” because if you hit a low point of -172,000, compound interest doesn’t really help you for that first 272K. . .

Income/expenses listed are at the end of that calendar year.

* *2011, age 24:*

Graduated in 2011 with a Civil Engineering Degree, wife was a student, working on a Masters in Public Health.  This was the absolute peak of the financial crisis for engineering.  I took a (not quite full time) temp job as a web developer making $20/hr, and we maxed out taking my wife’s student loans:

**Income: 31K me, 0K wife, 31K comb  ||  Exp: ~40K  ||  NW: -$163,000**

* *2012:*

Wife graduated grad school halfway through the year and got a fellowship for $24/hr.  My temp work finished halfway through the year, and I ‘worked’ full-time applying to engineering jobs.  Finally got one after a few hundred resumes, but wouldn’t start until just into the new year, 2013.  Which left that year at:

**Income: 12K me, 26K wife, 38K comb   ||  Expenses: ~40K  ||  NW: -$172,000**

* *2013, age 26: the tipping point year for FIRE*

Note that we *moved significanly backwards* the previous year in net worth due to student loan interest and spending. . .

Started a job as an engineer!  $52k per year ($25/hr).  Straight salary, with a terrible (in retrospect) company.  Worked a *ton* of hours, but only got paid the base salary.  I shudder to think what my hourly rate (working a lot of 70 hour weeks) actually was averaged over this year. . .  Still a financial step up!

**Discovered FIRE.**  I cannot stress enough how big of a change this made for my wife and me.  My wife was naturally a frugal person (I was *not*) but we both had otherwise terrible habits.  Once about my third real check rolled in I googled “Student Loan Repayment” and in the process of trying to find a more robust calculator (I was looking for, essentially, [unbury.us](http://unbury.us), though I didn’t know at that time it existed) and happened to stumble across Mr. Money Mustache in February.

I would like to pause for a minute to point out how terrible of a name this is:  I can credit this one website with legitimately changing my life in a very positive way, but if I ever try to explain what this life-altering blog was, it’s. . . mister money mustache.  Sigh.

I was consumed.  In less than a month I had read everything (and I mean *everything*) on MMM, MadFientist, and JL Collins; I devoured *Your Money or Your Life*, *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and *The Richest Man in Babylon*.  My wife and I planned out our financial goals (Get student loan free, then try to retire in 15 years; will finish well ahead of this) and drastically reduced expenses.  Started aggressively paying down student loans by ‘minimum payment amount’ first to reduce our DTI ratio, hoping to qualify for a mortgage.

I became obsessed with the idea of having a miniature empire of rental units that would help me reach FI faster: small, clean, well-maintained places that I loved and the tenants loved.  Planned to ‘house hack’ by getting a duplex and living in half – the worse shape the better!  I’d always been handy, I was looking forward to sweat equity.  Started looking for a house in May.

Got married in July of this year; I suppose all previous references to ‘wife’ should read fiancé before this. . .

**Bought a duplex:** We were approved for a mortgage due to having some *long* repayment lengths on student loans which kept our DTI ratio on *just* the right side of acceptable, and bought an absolute shithole of a duplex with 3% down in November in a pretty nice neighborhood in Minneapolis.  This was $196K, which seemed *really* high from the lows of 2009; that sounds funny in retrospect now looking back, but everyone was worried it was the midst of a second bubble at the time.  Moved in to one half, and inherited some tenants in the other.  Started rapidly fixing it up with every spare hour I had, as I was still working about 60 hours a week on average.

It was a busy year.

**Income: 52K me, 44K wife, 96K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$140,000**

* *2014:*

Hey, the NW is moving the right direction!!  But now we reach “the boring middle” part of FIRE.  My wife got a full time job with benefits (as opposed to a fellowship) with a pay bump.  I got a 12% raise from my terrible company, mostly in response to threatening to leave due to working conditions.  Working conditions did not improve.  At the end of the year I switched companies (wont’ be reflected in this years salary) to the place I’m still with.  They are a hugely better company to work for, and they pay for *every* hour I work.  The pay was about the same per hour, but since I was working 60hr/week I essentially got a 50% raise.

We began to live on just my wife’s paycheck, and used 100% of mine to pay off student loans/invest.  This hasn’t changed to this day. . . except we now also invest some of hers.

**Income: 58K me, 56K wife, 114K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$97,000**

More of the same, paying off student loans in 2016, continuing the aggressive saving until 2020. . .

* *2016:* **Income: 86K me, 70K wife, 156K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$33,000**

* *2017:* **Income: 101K me, 72K wife, 173K comb   ||  Expenses: ~60K  ||  NW: $45,000**

* *2018:* **Income: 93K me, 74K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $110,000**

* *2019:* **Income: 92K me, 75K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $300,000**

* *2020:* **Income: 110K me, 76K wife, 186K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $700K**

Note that NW has some weird jumps once we got past zero because the duplex went from essentially zero cash flow (lot of costs going in tended to burn all the rental income) to positive cash flow as we started to wrap the years of renovations, to a huge jump upon sale.

 
###2020:  Deciding to Simplify (Start again here, this is the point of the post!)

We had a kid.  

I had already been getting worn out of rental maintenance, especially as we had moved out of the duplex entirely and were renting both halves, now that it was nice.  Working a ton, and feeling like between a (more than) full time job, child, and rental, something had to give.  It was amazingly difficult to find a decent rental manager.

Our personal expenses had slowly shrunk down to be about $4,000/month, $1,500 of which was the mortgage on our new house.  In addition were the duplex costs, and the possibility that I had to have enough cash reserves to cover three furnaces, three water heaters, three stoves; also potential vacancies, other big ticket items (like a $14,000 roof job on the duplex, water damage from ice dams, etc) that were always potentially looming.

The rental income *did* cover these expenses: The duplex was working as a business.  But I was having basically $7,000 a month in expenses despite a fairly frugal lifestyle that had to be covered; **$84,000 a year that *had* to be earned and burned no matter what.**  My wife took a big chunk of time off for maternity, and I wanted to do significantly less, but this ‘burn rate’ was weighing on me.

Our three biggest expenses were the duplex, our house, and taxes.  Taxes are as low as they can be (all tax-advantaged accounts maxed out) and I’m happy to give back to the education and food programs that helped me, growing up.  But, I could sell the duplex, and roll all the profit into the new mortgage, and potentially go from needing to earn and burn $84,000 per year to $30,000. . .
 
###Rent out vs. Sell

I ran the numbers on if I kept the duplex, vs selling and investing it in the stock market.  I looked over the the next 6 years, which is about/past my FIRE date.  My estimated net worth difference would be around $80,000!  Nothing to sneeze at!  However, it also would be the difference between ~$1.3M and ~1.2M, both of which are over my FIRE number of $950K for 3.25% SWR.  If this had been the difference between $0 and $100K, that’d be huge.  That 1st 100K is the hardest.  The 13th 100K, however, is not.

I also had the added wrinkle that if we sold in 2020, it counts as a primary residence, and we don’t pay gains tax on the part we had lived in two of the last five years; this reduced the calculated 80k difference.

**Purposeful “Mistake” number 1: The duplex is gone.**

Was it worth an 8% reduction in net worth in 6 years to me to not have to deal with the rental property with a young child or two?  A thousand times yes.  I will have, I think, significantly less wealth in 30 years because I sold the rental duplex back in July.  But I will have *enough* either way, and I shall never get these years back.

I think buying, renovating, and renting that duplex was the best single financial action I ever took.  I’m happy I ground it out and did the completely hellish task of gutting a 110 year old building in the evenings around a 60hr/week job.  I also don’t think I’ll ever do it again. . .

### Pay off Mortgage vs Invest

What about, now that I’ve sold the duplex, putting it all in the market vs. paying off our home mortgage?  The numbers are pretty simple:  

5% real returns in the stock market (8% returns, 3% inflation, assumed).  Mortgage was, by happenstance, almost the same amount we got out in cash from the duplex, $153K.  We would then not have to pay the $1500/month that was going to principal and interest, and could invest that.  All number – as always – in 2021 dollars for simplicity.

* $153K invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $205k.
* $1,500/month invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $125K.
* A difference of, again, $80,000.  At least I’m consistent. . .

This one was much harder; I really wanted to reduce my ‘burn rate’, but this basically means that selling the duplex **and** using that to immediately pay off my mortgage made us (statistically) $160,000 poorer in about 6 years, another $80k of gains gone.

However, despite me not believing (allegedly) in timing the market, the CAPE is currently quite high. . . and I’m getting awfully close to being able to FIRE anyways, 4-8 years, pending variables.  I also intend to transition my 100% equities to a [100/60/100 V-shaped Bond Glide]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) to maximize safety at the cost of potential gains.  I also believe that [it doesn’t make sense to carry a mortgage into early or regular retirement]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/10/11/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-21-mortgage-in-retirement/).  These aren’t just numbers in a spreadsheet, I actually have to be able to shift the funds to be able to do this, in a way that’s not crippling from a tax perspective.  It’s going to take years to shift to a bond allocation slowly; trying to pay the mortgage off at the same time could very well be impossible.

I don’t have a target FIRE date; I intend to work less and less as I slide into ER, and having the mortgage paid off means that my wife and I can do this whenever we want, without having to do 5 years of financial maneuvering in the background to ‘pull the trigger’.  

The flexibility is worth it.  **Purposeful “Mistake” number 2: The mortgage is gone.**.

We now live very comfortable – I would say luxurious – lives on about $2,500/month.  This will increase sporadically for large trips and childcare, but is our past and current expenses, and will be further in the future too.  I intend to build a fairly large cushion in passive income over this for unforeseen events, then charity, if those don’t materialize, but we don’t feel impoverished in any way at this spending level.

We are privileged enough, lucky enough, and determined enough to now be making about $45/hr each gross, $36/hour each takehome.  This means we need to work a combined 70 hours in a month to be able to cover our expenses; that’s 35 hours each, or  an average about 8 hours *a week* throughout the year.  We are primed to be able to slowly “BaristaFIRE” with reduced hours and benefits in our current jobs, which we both (mostly) enjoy.  

We will both be only when we want – which might be not at all – by age 40.  If you had asked me at 25 if this was possible, I would have laughed in your face.",financialindependence

Her daughter has graduated with a pharmacy degree and she told us that she got a job lined up. She gets paid 50% of her wage until her professional cert comes through and then will be bumped up to 100%. I mentioned that coming from college her 50% pay will still be a big raise from what she's used to and that when she gets up to 100% she could keep living on 50% and save the rest.

She had already suggested that to her daughter and then the conversation shifted to all FIRE. She knew about leanFIRE and fatFIRE and talked about her coming retirement but how her husband likes to spend. I'm looking forward to some more real life discussions (with no numbers) and learning how it works for them since they are about 12-15 years ahead based on them having one kid done with school and 1 getting ready to start college compared to mine in elementary school and preschool.

645,The struggle to break away from the multigenerational wealth accumulation failure cycle. . .,,1231,9dra5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9dra5j/the_struggle_to_break_away_from_the/,1536298709.0,"I was 5 when my parents divorced. My mother raised me for about a year after that, before losing custody because she is mentally unstable. 

My mom is now 54 years old. She hasn’t held a job for longer than a year or two and she always spent every penny as soon as it hit her bank account. These days, she lives with a physically abusive often-unemployed husband, in a dilapidated house he recently inherited from his mother. They scrape by on my mom’s disability checks. 

My maternal grandmother lived in a small apartment with no savings, scraping by on social security until she died of cancer.

My father raised me. Like my mother, he has always been a low wage worker. Making matters worse, we live in a pretty HCOL area. Despite that, he squandered most of the money he earned. He remarried when I was 9. His new wife was also a low wage worker and a big spender. In my final 9 years of childhood, I watched my dad buy a new vehicle, new computers, video games, a new TV, PPV wrestling events, and hundreds of worthless trinkets.

When I became a young adult, not much had changed. My dad bought another brand new car. He continued buying worthless trinkets they set on their shelves to never look at again until it’s time to dust them off once in a while. He began getting hooked on Facebook games with micro transactions. At one point, he confessed to me that he spent over $4,000 on one Facebook game over the course of four or five years.  

Fast forward. My dad is now 51 years old. About five years ago, his wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A year or two after that, her employer was tired of accommodating her inability to stay on her feet, so she was let go. They went to apply for disability but they were denied. A lawyer began assisting them with the process. About a year ago, his wife needed multiple surgeries due to complications from the MS. Down to one insurance and one job, the medical bills piled up. 

Months ago, he confessed to me that he was going to lose his house to foreclosure and his life was falling apart. I was compassionate. They moved into an apartment and continue to spend money on unnecessary things like fast food and big car payments. He has 70k in retirement. 

Now to me. I was raised watching such frivolous spending, so a budget was pretty much foreign to me. I joined the military out of high school and lived paycheck to paycheck. I got married and bought a house at my duty station about two years before the housing market collapsed. The collapse coincided with my honorable discharge, and I returned to my home state with a house on the market that wasn’t getting any bites. With no savings, I couldn’t afford to lower the price or to keep paying the payments, and I lost the house to foreclosure. 

I began civilian life with a very low paying job, but I used my GI bill to get an undergraduate degree. As graduation neared, I divorced and began dating my best friend I’ve known since childhood. Soon after graduating, I got married and I moved into a townhouse she purchased from her mother years prior. We decided to sell that to move into a small home. That was fine until I landed a new job out of town that paid a little more. 

So, we moved out there while renting out the other house. That was fine until my wife got pregnant and she wanted to live closer to family. So we rented out the second house as well, and bought a house with the in-laws. My MIL became our child’s full-time nanny while we worked. We had to subsidize my MIL’s early retirement because she, too, was terrible with money and had virtually zero dollars in retirement at age 55. 

I landed a job that paid even more. Our two rental properties are older and began having problems, causing us to rack up credit card debt. That’s on top of older debt from remodeling a portion of one of the homes to make it more likely to attract renters. 

Here I am at 31 years of age with about $100k in retirement (between my wife and I) and a -$900k net worth. $48k is a debt consolidation loan that slightly reduced our interest rate. $16k is credit card debt from repairs to get the rentals in selling condition. $11k is a car loan. $3k is another car loan. The rest... three mortgages. 

I posted on here a while back but I had too much shame to admit we actually had TWO rentals with our completely dumpster fire finances. But we took the criticism to heart and we’re selling both rentals, aggressively paying down debt, and then saving for retirement at a savings rate of about 50% ($50,000/yr). We really don’t want to repeat the mistakes of our parents and grandparents, and so we won’t. A little over a year ago, I knew very little about retirement investments. Thanks to FI blogs and this subreddit, I have a very good grasp on the basics. It’s surprisingly simple and I now know the path to retiring wealthy by our early 50s. 

We are making nearly $100k/yr net now. We should be making $20k-40k  from our rental sales, which can knock out a lot of our debt. We expect to have our debt paid off no later than 2020 and potentially before the end of 2019, at which point we can really ramp up our savings. With each raise, we’ll throw more into investments, eventually increasing our savings rate to 60-70%. We will teach our kids the value of saving... and they’ll learn by our example.

I just wanted to share my story of breaking away from the cycle (I haven’t yet but I’m sure on the right track). And I wanted to thank those of you whom I have learned from as I lurk this sub almost every day. Thanks for the learning moments and the laughs, and more importantly, thanks for the tough love in my previous FI post. I’ll give another update in a year or two, perhaps. 

TL;DR - our families never saved a dime as we grew up and neither did their parents . . . We began making the same errors in life but we are finally breaking the cycle thanks in part to this sub and informative FI blogs. 

Edit: Grammar and spelling corrections. 

Edit 2: Daaang. This really blew up. Thanks very much for all the kind words (and the gold). And yes, I screwed up my net worth calculation again. I will remember how to calculate it next time. Always learning. I’m glad some of you can relate with my story. I look forward to telling you all to go fuck yourselves over the coming years. Cheers. ",financialindependence
646,Story for lower income earners,,1226,bzcxsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bzcxsp/story_for_lower_income_earners/,1560262075.0,"I love reading the stories on here because they are so inspiring. I’m in my early 40s and I just discovered this sub this last year. I would love to retire early however my reality is that it probably won’t happen. If I could at least retire when I’m 65 I’ll be happy. Here’s my story for people who have fairly low income and/or start saving later in life.

Annually, I gross $58,000-$59,000 a year and I live in a high cost living area. Luckily I was able to buy a condo when the market was extremely low in 2010 so my mortgage is lower then if I was renting. I am debt-free except for my mortgage so I’m able to save 25-26% of my salary for retirement, vacation etc. i’m trying to be a little bit more aggressive at putting extra money towards my mortgage so hopefully I can pay it off when I am 55 years old.

I started saving for retirement a little bit in my 20s but didn’t really get aggressive about it until about mid 30s. I put 15% of my salary towards my retirement and hopefully I’ll have a nice chunk of change when I’m 65.

Edit:
Thanks for all the comments. I realize $59,000 annual salary isn’t considered low income in many areas. However I live in a HCOL and my income is on the lower side. I’m inspired to keep learning about finances and wanted to inspire people who might be in a similar position as myself.",financialindependence

Almost lean FIRE but i'm rich over here.

$330 000 CAD in high dividend ETF's = $1200 CAD per month
$28 000 CAD in LRSP = returns reinvested 
$75 000 USD rental house in Cambodia = $400 USD per month
$75 000 USD home in Cambodia = -$125 USD per month (water, power, WIFI, cable)
$10 000 USD emergency fund = $0 a month

So we have about $40 give or take to spend a day over here, which is hard to spend. Beer is 40 cents a can, I just had Pad Thai at a restaurant for $2. Let's just say it's very cheap. We want to put a little coffee shop on the ground floor of our house so we can ""barista FIRE"" but it's more just for fun to give my wife somewhere to hang with her friends. 

Cambodia uses the USD which sucked when buying our place but whatever. My cell phone plan 4g unlimited is $8 a month. I was paying $120 in Canada.

Always saved a bit back in Canada but mostly I felt like Canada was becoming very expensive for the quality of life achieved. So I sold my house and moved. There is something inherently pleasing about swimming in the ocean every day, eating truly fresh meat and veggies, and getting a full body massage daily.

I grew up elsewhere in the Rust Belt, in an economically stagnant area -- and by that, I mean the median family income in this city last year was $24,000, and the median home value sits around $40,000. My family clocked in at about 2x both of those figures, which represents the approximate average for a family of four in the US. However, by my town's standards, we led a comfortable middle-class life.

My upbringing makes me think of one of most common criticisms of the FIRE concept: that FIRErs are  mainly high-income earners that happen to live in LCOL areas, and that this isn't as obtainable for those without high incomes or those whose jobs can only be done in or around H/MCOL markets. I'm not rich, but I pulled in about $63k last year. Not stellar, and slightly above average for the US as a whole, but not bad for a 27-year old with a mediocre accounting degree from a Tier 4 state school, and a pretty far cry from my hometown's median of $24k. My job can be done remotely from anywhere, which allows me to live in a $900/month apartment about 45 minutes from the city with no roommates and no family to provide for, and save roughly 30-50% of my take-home pay depending on the month. I've been dealt a pretty favorable hand as far as income goes, and that level of privilege is what makes me think about how the FIRE concept relates to the US as a whole, even pre-COVID. It seems to be that a lot of the FIRE literature is aimed at people who are already middle to upper-middle class, but who have a spendy lifestyle that keeps them from accumulating wealth. Oh, if only they could get out of their BMW lease or their Starbucks habit, and FI would be theirs...or such is the theme of all of these books.

It makes me chuckle a little when I hear things like ""cook all your meals at home! Take public transit! Exercise in the park instead of paying for a gym! Use your library instead of buying books/DVDs!"" because in my neck of the woods, ***everybody was already doing that***. Not as a lifestyle choice -- it was their *only* lifestyle choice.

It's this reality that makes me think twice when I hear Millionaire-Next-Door-esque comments like ""anyone can FIRE if you work hard enough."" While that is theoretically true, there's no escaping the reality not everyone is running this race out of the same gate. My quick and dirty calculations would have more more-or-less leanfire at 50, or FIRE at 55 or so, without taking into account Social Security or FERS pension. This is so far removed from the reality in my hometown that it isn't even funny, where most young workers live hand-to-mouth and retirees live entirely on SS. I'm not doing anything they are not doing; practically the only difference is that I was able to increase my income to a slightly-above average level that is honestly not that impressive on the national scale.

I'm not sure if comments or thoughts like this are typical of FIRErs, especially those from bottom-quartile income backgrounds, and I'm wondering what, if anything, we as a FIRE community should be doing to improve access to financial education for the country at large.

Too much happy energy to avoid it.”
 
- Mr. Money Mustache responding to someone on Twitter

That quote was recounted on the [Mad Fientist podcast with Michael Kitces on the 4% rule](https://www.madfientist.com/michael-kitces-interview/) (which is a must-listen episode, BTW). Michael is a fee-only financial advisor who routinely works with early retirees. After listening to this episode, I'm wondering if many of us can ""retire"" earlier than we thought.

More on this subject from the interview in no particular order:

>  “In reality, we need things to wake up to in the morning. We need to have a sense of progress, and we crave to have something that gives us a feeling like we’re having impact. Most of those things end up being something that make money!”

> “We see this routinely with clients and have for years and years now. If you’ve got any capability to work in retirement, most people we see continue to work in retirement for a period of time. Or they take some time off and realize that they’re kind of bored, and they go back working in early retirement.”

> “…the number of people who insisted on getting to their pure stand-alone FI number because they never ever ever ever ever wanted to work again… and then within 3 years were working again…”

> “I find a lot of early FI folks grossly underestimate the sheer impact of just doing a little part time work for like $10,000 a year. Assuming a 3% withdrawal rate, an extra $10,000 of side gig income is like having another $300,000 in your portfolio.”

> (talking about a client) “I know you’re trying to work another 7 more years for early retirement, but if you just cut back your work and income 50%, you’d be ready to ‘retire’ today.”

While I'm also working toward FI, if I'm being honest with myself, I'll likely never be able to retire fully (unless I'm physically or mentally unable). 

Even if I hit my number and wave goodbye to my job, I'll probably pick up a hustle and start earning at money again within a few months. I won't work full-time, or all year, but I will most certainly work. Given this information, I'm sincerely considering leaving full-time employment earlier than planned (like super-lean FIRE territory...)

**Is anyone else planning on working on an income-generating activity in early retirement?** If so, are you adjusting your FI number to account for this? Or do you disagree with this sentiment?

I did not really feel motivated to look for another job right away so after looking over my finances, I determined that I was leanFIRE ready and decided to go for it.

**Brief bullet point breakdown of how I reached FIRE:**

\-9 years in the Army as an Officer after I graduated college, 3.5 years of that spent overseas (combat deployments earn bonus pay and salary is not taxed)

\-Low spending, high savings, aggressive investment into the stock market starting in 2009 (almost exclusively index funds), and all throughout the bull market recovery over the following 10 years.  Savings rate ranged from roughly 30% (early in my career) to 95% (during a year of combat deployment in which I spent almost no money as I was living in an Army base in the desert with no bills to pay and not much to spend money on)

\-Always looked for ways to save money, cut my own hair, made my own lunches, took advantage of military benefits such as the GI Bill to further my education for free, didn’t make a purchase if there was a free/cheaper alternative etc.

\-Left the Army due to health issues, received military disability, which makes me eligible for VA healthcare as well as receiving a monthly disability check.

\-Got a job as a manager for a manufacturing company for 1 year after the Army, but was then laid off due to restructuring.  Decided to leanFIRE early after that as opposed to finding another job for another couple years.

&#x200B;

**Major financial events over the last year (tldr at the end):**

**Buying a new property:**

So, after I decided to FIRE, my first major decision was to buy a permanent home as I had been renting all of my professional career due to moving a lot in the Army.  I decided to purchase a duplex/multi family property so that I could live in one unit and rent out the other for additional income.  I ended up getting one for cheap because the previous owners had not maintained it well and it needed a lot of cosmetic work, but structurally it was fine.

The building had 2 apartments, a 1200 square foot apartment that a family of long term renters lived in (they had lived there 12 years and raised their kids there, they had paid rent on time and taken pretty good care of their apartment, at least considering how little the landlord had done).  It did have a number of issues though, they had pipe leaks, a broken dishwasher, a toilet that needed replacing, a few holes in the walls that had never been patched up etc.

The other unit was an 800 square foot apartment that was in very bad shape, lots of water damage/mold that needed to be completely renovated (walls, floors, kitchen/bathroom cabinets) pretty much the entire apartment needed to be stripped down and redone.  There was also work that needed to be done on the outside of the house such as broken gutters, a broke down shed in the back that was just a pile of scrap and other stuff.

The property was valued at approximately $117,000 according to tax estimates, the owner had it on sale for $111,000, and it had been listed for almost half a year (most people don’t want to own a duplex and have to fix up a lot of issues after buying a house).  After a lot of haggling back and forth, I bought the property as is for $90,000.  This also is why there is a jagged “slice” in the first part of my net worth chart, where I sold investments and then added the value of the property shortly after.

The negotiations took place at the end of 2019, but I scheduled the actual sale to happen in January, reason being was I was planning on selling off investments to pay for the house in cash, but as I would be earning no salary in 2020, my taxes would be very low for my long term capital gains.  Everything with the sale went smoothly.  I worked with a real estate agent that I got through a Army Veterans housing program who had worked with Soldiers before, solid guy, would recommend.

**Renovation and Flooding:**

From January through May I had the house renovated, fixed a LOT of issues.  Everything was perfect, I fixed all the major issues in the renter’s apartment (they were very happy) and completely redid the 800 foot apartment which I was going to move into, new floors, walls, ceiling, kitchen, bathroom etc.  Took a video of a walk through of it to show off to my family and had my move in date scheduled.

The DAY BEFORE I was supposed to move in, the area was hit by the worst flooding in about 14 years.  While the flood did not directly flood the area where my house was, it turns out there is a drain right outside my apartment (which is much lower elevation than the tenants apartment) that led straight to the river, when the river flooded it pushed water up the drain and into my apartment.  I rushed down to find 4 inches of standing water in my brand new apartment.  I cancelled the move, bought a pump to get the water out and called servpro for water damage cleanup.  Brand new flooring and cabinets had to be replaced and the walls had to be cut into about halfway up because they had soaked up too much water.  This was not only expensive but soul crushing as well, my brand new apartment was wrecked.

Second renovations happened from May-June, I salvaged what I could.  I didn’t want to buy brand new cabinets/counters all over again so I reused what I could, but it definitely lost a lot of the “brand new” feeling that it had had before.

Anyway, the move in finally happened at the end of June.  I had also been renting an apartment during the whole renovation process, so was paying rent and apartment utilities from November 2019 through July 2020 on top of everything else.

**Tldr:**

Bought a duplex for $90,000, valued at $117,000, but it needed a lot of repairs/renovations.  Long term tenants already living in one unit.

Spent roughly $23,000 on the first set of renovations to fix up both apartments.

Area flooded, flooding my new apartment.

Spent roughly $17,500 on the post flood cleanup and second round of renovations 

See expenses/earnings spreadsheet linked at the top of this post for more details.

Also spent roughly $7,000 on rent and utilities from November through July for a place to stay while renovating the new place.

Amazingly, even though I was spending a large amount of money during this time, my net worth still continued to increase (see the net worth chart) thanks to the market continuing to grow.

&#x200B;

**Current financial situation (see earning/spending spreadsheet for full budget breakdown):**

Current annual income (Sources are Investment dividends/interest, rent and military disability):

\~$31,000

Estimated annual expenses (not including unplanned expenses)

\~$15,000

After all the ridiculous amount of spending I did during the first half of the year (And also why I do not have a spending tracking chart as it would look bonkers) I have now settled down into a regular schedule.  I am continuing to be thrifty, as it’s the lifestyle I’ve lived for the last 10 years and is routine now.  Thanks to my 3 streams of passive income I am now actually generating more income than expenses.

I’ve tried to make my budget as detailed in terms of planned expenses as I can, but there will always be outliers.  For example, due to how unusual my finances are this year (no salary, huge sale of investments, purchase of property and many tax deductible repairs) I’m hiring a CPA to do my taxes for the first time.  It will cost $400 for him to do my taxes, and I also had a 1 hour meeting with him in which I asked him a whole bunch of tax related questions regarding my current citation, which cost another $200.  After this year I expect I should be able to go back to doing my own taxes as I have in years past, so this expense is something that lies outside my normal planned budget.  But even with these one time/unexpected expenses, I’m still very much in the green in terms of my budget.

&#x200B;

**Satisfaction with the FIRE lifestyle:**

I am a very unusual person, in that I am quite happy being by myself 95% of the time.  I’m also very easy to keep entertained.  Books/audio books, movies, TV shows, games, most of my entertainment is digital.  And it’s actually only in the last year that I’ve realized just how vast the amount of entertainment that there is available.  I’ve got a giant list of TV shows, movies, books, games that I’ve been interested in consuming, and if anything that list has only gotten bigger over the last year.

I also find myself mini-side projects to occupy myself with. For example,  I joined an online consulting website early in the year where you post your resume and companies will contact you if they want to get feedback/testing on a product/website/procedure that they have.  Given my experience in the military and logistics, I was able to enter a few of these interviews/testings, and also make a bit of money on the side doing it.  Naturally, as my skills deteriorate, I’ll be less eligible for this type of thing but it was fun.

Over the last year, I honestly can’t think of a single moment where I thought to myself “I’m bored, I’ve got nothing to do”.  If anything I’ve spent many late nights absorbed in something (which is ok since I can wake up whenever I feel like it now).

And afternoon naps, they are a thing that I love so much.  When I was in the military I would typically get up around 5:30-6:00 in the morning, go exercise with my unit for an hour, then shower/change and jump into the work day.  It would usually be right after lunch when things had calmed down a bit that I would usually start to get drowsy and would have to stay on my feet so that I wouldn’t risk dozing off if I sat down.  Now if I’m tired after lunch, I can take a nap and it’s awesome.  It does wreck my sleep schedule on occasion though.

Retiring right into the middle of a pandemic has not been ideal of course.  I did want to travel a bit after retirement, there are a number of annual conventions/conferences I’ve always been interested in but never attended due to my focus on work.  They are a no-go this year and probably next year as well.  The same goes for socializing, while I’m perfectly happy to be alone most of the time I do occasionally want to engage in social activities.  When I was in college I was big into pen and paper role playing games with a group of friends but have not gotten involved in it since then.  There are a couple gaming stores in town but they have shut down during the pandemic.  Fortunately I found a website that lets you form/find groups of people to play with online, and there are a number of digital tools that let you create characters, maps, roll dice etc.  So I’m now part of a weekly online gaming group that are currently deep into our first campaign together.  It’s great fun and fills my social interaction itch while being stuck at home.

Many people say that “people need to work in order to have purpose and direction in their life” to which I say BS.  I’ve experienced a lot in my life so far.  I was raised overseas,  I’ve traveled to over 20 countries in 5 continents, am an eagle scout, have been to war, have been in leadership roles my entire professional career.  At this point, living a boring, relaxing life is just what I want and need.  I’m not ambitious, I don’t want to be a CEO, hold political office or live like a celebrity.  I just want to live a relaxing life and enjoy my hobbies.  That may change some day, and if it does, then I’ll make adjustments in my life.  But right now I’m living a life I very much enjoy and have no reason to change it.

&#x200B;

**Future plans:**

Here are some things I'm interested in accomplishing in the next year or so.

Travel - as I mentioned above, once the pandemic is over (second half of next year seems to the general estimate from experts) I plan on visiting a number of conventions/conferences/locations that I’ve been interested in but never got around to seeing while I was working.  The good thing is that I can also take advantage of the off-peak traveling season for lower prices/less crowds for any places I want to sight see.

Getting a dog - I love dogs, but never got one before because of how often I was either out of the country or away from home for extended periods of time.  Especially since I am single I didn’t want to end up ditching it somewhere whenever I was gone.  I held off on making any serious commitments during my 1st year post-FIRE just in case I changed my mind but most likely I’ll start looking for a dog to adopt early next year, there are a couple animal shelters near me that I’ve already stopped by to check out.

More time with family - Again, something that has been derailed because of the pandemic.  Due to being in the military I did not get a chance to spend much time with my parents (especially when overseas).  I only saw them 1-2 times a year for a good chunk of my career.  We are quite used to it given that my family has moved pretty frequently all my life (we were ex-pats living overseas when I was growing up) but I had hoped to be able to visit them more often now that I have so much free time.  Unfortunately that’s not been possible given the current citation as I don’t want to risk possibly infecting them.  But we do talk much more frequently than in the past.

Becoming more handy with home improvement/repair - I’ve been learning basic home improvement skills (As have many people who are stuck at home during this time, lowes is always packed).  I’ve learned to take apart and clean a window AC unit, caulk a bathtub, hang curtains etc.  I’ll leave the more complicated stuff like plumbing and electrical to the experts, but it’s nice being able to take care of minor stuff myself.

Boosting my emergency fund - I currently have about 7 months of spending in my savings account, I intend to increase this to 12 months of spending over the course of the next several months.  The economy is wack right now and it would not surprise me at all if we have a full blown recession and market crash in the near future, so while the market is strong I’m going to boost my emergency fund.  After that I’ll probably stop withdrawing my dividends from my investments in cash and just let them reinvest back into themselves, I think I can live quite easily on the income I get from my military disability and rent while leaving my investments to grow.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

So, to conclude this very long post.  It’s been a crazy year, I’ve experienced a lot of things I’ve not done before, but overall, I’m very happy with my current lifestyle and have no desire to change it anytime soon.

657,"I'm quitting soon. No, I'm still far away from FIRE.",,1213,je491v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/je491v/im_quitting_soon_no_im_still_far_away_from_fire/,1603122881.0,"Just wanted to share a realization I've had after my recent therapy session. I'm hoping what I write will reach someone who's also in similar shoes.

I loathe my job. Waking up on five out of seven days of my weeks is a chore in itself, when I know I have to spend the rest of the day on something I hate. There was a time when I liked doing it, being good at it, and being paid well for it. But now I feel unmotivated, lethargic. I feel like what I do now is so inconsequential to the world - I wanted to do something with more meaning. I have cycles of feeling neutral then negative at work. Recently, I've been at a low point, which is forcing me to think about what I want and what I should do.

But I kept going on because it paid well and every day slogging through inched me closer to FIRE. 

I've realized this a year or so ago now, and my action was to start a Master's degree at a field I think I would like, and it's being going well so far. I love learning this new field, and I feel like I could make real change happen if I get good with it. It's been a long time since I felt genuine excitement and curiosity and the want to learn and push through with it.

I was thinking, what if I just funded myself, lived on my savings, while I move forward in my degree and dive myself fully into the new field? The risks are that I might not be employable for an unknown amount of time which would have adverse effects on my timeline to FIRE. Being stuck in this dilemma has made me more miserable wasting away my days at a job I hate. 

It's not even my workplace. They're amazing and supportive. My manager is understanding, everyone's working for a great cause. It's just what I do specifically that I no longer get satisfaction from. Which is making the decision harder - why waste a good job with good people and good benefits?

The light on my head lit when I told myself this sentence: **Is FIRE worth delaying for n years if the change I'm attempting could make that journey less miserable?**

What was the point of me trying to free myself from work in the future, if in order to achieve that, I have to enslave myself right now? I am clearly unhappy, and have been for a long time.

I think it's time I make the jump. I'm going to be quitting to focus on my studies and prepare myself for my career pivot ahead. I'm lucky enough to have savings to give me the freedom to be able to do this, so I will.

I think what I want to try and say is, we all are invested in the FIRE mindset because we want to free ourselves from decisions that we only make because we need to earn the money to eat, live, survive. While FIRE is the penultimate goal, please check in with yourself and ask if you are happy now. Maybe there is a way your money now can give you the freedom you're earning for yourself in the future, now, albeit in a lesser, temporary form.",financialindependence

I'm still single and don't plan to get married or have a family. My only goals are to live a modest, quiet life, and for work to be an option rather than a necessity. Do I really need millions of dollars to do that?

These days, I see people here with $1.5 million portfolios saying that they plan to work high stress jobs for another 10 years. Or people with $2 or $3 million who are targeting $5 million, then $10 million, etc. I feel like a lot of the target numbers I've seen here keep getting higher and higher with no end in sight. I get that you need to plan for high expenses in life, like health insurance, aging parents, or if you plan to have kids or live in a high cost area. I feel like this sub changed a lot in the last few years. I'm just a modest earner, with a relatively low FI target number. But maybe I'm wrong and I should be re-evaluating my goals.

My story is a bit different.  

I work doing manual labor on a boat, I am part of the deck crew meaning I help with cleaning, safety and navigation.  This is a job that does not require a degree and pays really well ($3800/mo + bonuses) considering I have zero life expenses.  January was an especially good month for me as I cleared well over $20,000.  I have the option to save 100% of my pay if I want to since rent, food, internet, etc… is all part of my employment- all while I travel to some of the most pristine places on earth.  

Basically, I opened a Roth IRA when I was 16, and started investing heavily 5 years ago.  I do the standard  VOO, VTI, BND investments in my brokerage fund, nothing exotic or exciting there.  I have no credit card debt, student loans, mortgage or car payments- just pure cash and stocks/ETFs.  In fact I don't own anything more than what I can fit in 2 duffle bags.  I used to work in high finance right after university but 3 years ago I quit the corporate grind to do my current work after I started feeling like I was on a treadmill.  It is staggering how quickly you can make progress when you no longer have any required life expenses.

Long term, I think I should be able to hit my goal of $900,000 by my 35th birthday, as my salary is set to grow quickly, at which point I’ll become “work optional”.  I like what I do though and there is always the potential to take temp work to move vessels around the world if the destination/pay interests me.

I am now 40 and still working.

I was just over 22 when I got out of the military and entered the world of government contracting in IT.  At age 25, I had no responsibilities, no bills to speak of and a very good paying job.  I discovered the 4% rule and planned to retire at 35.  Ten years was all it would take for me to save the money providing my situation didn't change.

Then I got married, bought a house at the peak of the bubble and had kids.

The revised plan is 57.  I converted to being a government employee and that is the minimum age that I can collect benefits and keep my health plan unless they offer VERA (voluntary early retirement authority).  I have plenty of other investments that would allow me to retire earlier but it certainly feels safer waiting now that I am responsible for 3 other people.

To the extent possible, I am trying to live my life now the way I will when I am retired which is a complete dichotomy.

One side of the dichotomy is about having as many fulfilling experiences as possible.  I take full advantage of the 26 paid vacation days I get per year.  We take no less than 3 full vacations combined with some mini vacations like an amusement park road trip to end summer break.

The other side is that, in everything not-experience related, I am as frugal as possible.  Some people can't understand why I ride a scooter to work rather than buying a car.  These people also have no plan to stop working before they die.

Greetings all. I think this is actually my first post in this subreddit, though I’ve been lurking for about a year now. 

I’m a 27yr male, birthday was on the 30th. I bring up the birthday because it was also the same day that my invested / saved net worth crossed the $100,000 mark! 

I’m no drug addled mom, though her story was pretty kickass. In fact I got pretty lucky in life with college and afterwards. I was able to graduate debt free and I stumbled into a job with a Fortune 50 company working in Information Technology. 

Salary: 108,000
Stock: 25,000/year on average

I max out my 401K, HSA, IRA every year. I’ve got 25,000 saved up as an emergency fund, though I’ve been debating dropping that down to 10,000. I save around ~60,000 a year between all of tax advantaged and standard brokerage accounts. I know this doesn’t make me some special butterfly— higher salary lets you save more, who knew. Some of that is being diverted this year into a 529 account to cover my master’s in 2 years and to help cover my new-ish Nephew’s college in 15 years. 

As I said, my story doesn’t make me some special case. I didn’t have some great adversity to overcome in life. I was raised middle class, I managed to graduate with no debt from college, and my first real job out of college was with a Fortune 50. I got lucky in life.

But I also saw what I didn’t want to have happen to me. My mom worked her whole life until me and sister were born, and then became a full time mom. Her and my dad, despite being married and still are, always kept their finances separated. Dad made good money, mom did not. Mom isn’t going to retire with much, if she ever does retire. 

My sister became a teacher, bless her heart. She wanted to empower the youth of our future and I thank her every day for it. But that is not a financially safe career in the US. She and her husband struggle a bit— not living paycheck to paycheck, but there are things that they can’t afford that they really wish they could. 

I don’t help them out directly, because I don’t want to give them a handout, but I do want to help. I’ve been fortunate enough in life to have some extra, and so I’ve begun socking money away for my Nephew’s college. Even if there’s not enough saved up for him to get out debt free, if I can remove a sizeable portion of his debt then that will better empower him. I know the advantages of not having student loans. 

I honestly don’t know if I will ever retire. I like working and keeping busy. A part of me really wants to setup a grant or foundation before I die so that I can empower others through my good fortune. Just save up as much as I can through life, get that “fuck you money” and then coast. Share the rest with people who need it.",financialindependence
664,Why you should consider a 5-6% withdrawal rate,,1198,8a0xl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8a0xl3/why_you_should_consider_a_56_withdrawal_rate/,1522944095.0,"EDIT: based on all your responses I have created a new post that tackles this question from a different angle: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8ac4ry/choosing_your_personal_withdrawal_rate/


I know - this is unorthodox but hear me out. And obviously the below depends on what you want out of FIRE - I understand a 3-4% withdrawal rate may be the right option for some of you.

When reading through the posts and comments, I’ve noticed a trend on this subreddit to lower the SWR from 4% to somewhere in the 3 range. People give many reasons for this: I want to be extra safe, the market may not have as good of returns as it did in the past, I have a longer than 30 year time horizon, etc.


This is not surprising - most people on this subreddit are risk-adverse by nature and 3% feels a lot less risky than 4%, so why not? I think (for most people) this is a big mistake.

I will get into the details below, but largely there are two reasons - 1) A lower SWR has a large opportunity cost while only protecting against a potential risk. 2) The SWR rate, as typically discussed, is rigid and naive.


1)  A lower SWR has a large opportunity cost while only protecting against a potential risk.

Why do you want to FIRE? While there are millions of reasons, most are some form of - I would live my life differently, if I didn’t have to worry about earning money. This may mean stop working, working somewhere else, volunteering, traveling, etc. The point is, every year you are not FIRE you are not living that life (yes, yes, you should be living the life you want even when you’re not FIRE - I think the point still stands).

It seems that when picking a SWR, most people don’t fully appreciate the opportunity cost of lowering it 1-2%. Let’s take an example of a 45 year old with a current net worth of $725,000, who wants to spend ~40,000 a year in retirement (and  let’s say they have an income of 70k post tax). If they use a 5.5% withdrawal rate - they could retire today. If they want to do a 4% withdrawal rate, they will need to work another 4 years. If they want a 3% withdrawal rate, they will need to work another 8 years. 

This is a MASSIVE cost. If this person lives until 90, they are giving up 9%/18% of their FIRE time. Additionally, they are giving up the BEST FIRE time while they are still young enough to do what they want to do. This person incurs this cost 100% of the time.

I hope I have convinced you that if you are thinking of lowering your SWR rate (or not raising it), you should first internalize the massive cost it has.

So now you are probably thinking - sure it has a big cost, but it also has a huge benefit - lowering your chance of going broke in retirement!

That brings me to my second point: 2) The SWR rate, as typically discussed, is rigid and naive.

There are 4 reasons to not worry greatly about a too-high withdrawal rate:
A) A failure only happens some percentage of time, and when it does, you can tell within a few years
B) In bad cases, you can always adjust your withdrawal rate
C) Many people’s income in retirement will not go to 0 - but instead just decreases substantially
D) In really bad cases, you can always go back to work

A) The first thing to realize about lowering your SWR is that it is only beneficial some % of the time. According to FIREcalc, a 5.5% SWR will succeed 62% of the time, a 4% SWR will succeed 95% of the time, and a 3% withdrawal rate will succeed 100% of the time. This means that 62% of the time - working 4-8 extra years will not have benefitted you! Additionally, it is not like you will wake up when you are 85 to learn if you are in the 62% or the 38% - other research has shown that the returns of the first few years are massively predictive of success vs. failure. This means that if you do get unlucky, you will know quickly and be able to do something about it.

B) As typically discussed, the SWR says - a person will take out $X regardless of what happens year after year until they die - which is obviously ridiculous. Research has shown that lowering your withdrawal rate if your portfolio drops substantially increases your chances at success. So if you are willing to be flexible in your spending (which I think most here are), then you’ve just reduced your risk quite a bit.

C) This only applies to some of you - but I know that most people’s post FIRE plans do not involve their income being 0 forever. Some people want to work at a lower paying job, some people want to work part time, some people enjoy their side hustle, etc. If you want (or wouldn’t mind) doing something that makes even a little money post FIRE - once again, your chances at success just increased drastically.

D) Let’s say everything goes terribly - the market crashes, you can’t lower your spending, etc. You can always go back to work for a few years. Remember, THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO ANYWAY! You were already going to keep working for 5 or more years to get your SWR lower - in this way of thinking about things, you only have to IF things go terribly. If things go well, you just saved yourself years of not FIREing.


I want to emphasize that I understand that this doesn’t work for everyone for various reasons - maybe your biggest goal in FIRE is security or maybe your 100% never want to work again. Maybe you are already leanFIRE and couldn’t lower your spending if you needed to.

The point of this post is to try to get people to think of choosing their SWR as a cost/benefit analysis. For me (and I think many others), the costs of not FIREing for years are quite high and the benefits of a lower SWR are pretty low.

Thoughts? Did I miss something? I want to know what you all think.

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses! 2 points have been raised frequently that I would like to respond to:
1) You can’t simply go back to work - after being out of the job market for a long time, trying to find a good job will be very difficult (especially because it will probably be a recession). 

That is a great point, and the extent of how true it is will depend on many factors like your line of work, your current income, etc. I do have 2 counterpoints though: A) People seem to be focusing on this and forgetting that it is the worst case scenario. This is only relevant if the market does terribly, you can’t lower your spending enough to compensate, and you have $0 in retirement income. The chances of all three of these being true strike me as quite unlikely (though it obviously depends on your situation). I’m thinking probably <10% for most people. B) You don’t need your old job or your old income - in fact, you probably need very little income and can do things like part-time work. Let’s take our example of the person spending 40k in retirement which is a 5.5% WR. If this person lowers their spending by 5k and then gets a part-time job earning only 10k a year - suddenly they are withdrawing only 25k which will help them manage until the market recovers. 

If that sounds terrible to you then maybe a 3-4% withdrawal rate is right for you! My point is that people should consider that those are options when they face the decision of whether or not to work 5 more years.

2) P/E values are high, what if your spending goes up in retirement, what if you face a large medical expense, etc.

Again, this is a good point and because of it, I probably shouldn’t be recommending specific WRs. Many of you can certainly do a better job than I can discussing the safety of specific WRs. My point in general is that when people consider different WRs, most don’t fully take into account different options they will have and the costs/benefits associated with them. So if you think that a 2% WR will have a 96% success rate instead of a 4% WR - they I hope this post makes you consider the option of going with a 3% WR.",financialindependence

I found it interesting that inflation adjusted, $100/month then is \~ $18,000 year now - mighty close to 401k limits. Also, it uses a 6% return as an example. In their case, they talk about using bonds but that's pretty much the same rate people target today in a balanced portfolio.

Plugging in to inflation and compound interest calculators, they're talking about the modern day equivalent of getting to $440,000 in 15 years, or \~ $17,000/yr at 4% rule. Within striking distance of leanFIRE!

One of my parents was recently hiring and someone came in with a two year gap on their resume. During the interview, he explained that he had taken a temporary early retirement since he could. Neither of my parents had ever heard of this and both thought it was ridiculous when we talked about it at dinner. I introduced them to the ideas of the FI movement since it seemed pretty obvious to me that this guy was a part of it. They’ve been asking me a lot about FI ever since which is pretty cool. That said, they were also worried he might just decide to walk out one day as well.

People here regularly talk  about others not understanding FI when discussing budgets, lifestyle, etc. but I haven’t send much on coming back to work after an early retirement. Many hiring managers don’t know about FI. My parents immediately assumed it was a lie to cover up for the inability to get a job (he could have been lying too, who knows). Just keep in mind that an early retirement may hinder getting another job when going back into the workforce.

The next day the Fed loaned AIG $85 billion to prevent bankruptcy.

The day after that Washington Mutual went up for sale and interbank lending stopped.

On Thursday treasurery secretary Paulson briefed Congress on an emergency relief plan being put together (later called TARP), the president cancelled his travel plans to remain in Washington, and Morgan Stanley shares dropped by 46% over the course of a few hours. Paulson tried to broker a deal to *give* Morgan Stanley to JP Morgan Chase for free, but JPMC *refused to take it*. 

On Friday Paulson announced a $700 billion bailout and said ""If it doesn’t pass, then heaven help us all.” President Bush later said, of the program, ""I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system""

669,[Update] $250k the boring way,,1185,c4ppcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/,1561389684.0,"This is an update of [my previous post, “$100k the boring way”]( https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way). I’ll try to recap the highlights in this post but read this for all the details.

**Summary**

Reached $250k (now $300k) net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 6 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart with annotations included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Quick Recap**

My wife and I are both 30 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I’m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $100k net worth we:

* Both got graduate degrees.
* Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
* Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $99k for me and $54k to $67k for my wife.
* Got pregnant.

**Updates**

2017: Had the baby in the fall, didn’t sleep much.

2018: Wife went back to work after using up all her sick leave and going unpaid for 2 months. I saved up a ton of PTO but only ended up taking a week at birth and then random days here and there as needed. Daughter is in full time daycare except for summers when my wife is off work.

In the spring our landlord surprised us by letting us know she needed her house back. We had about 4 months remaining in our lease to find a new place and there was a lot of stress about buying into a seller’s market. After looking at rental numbers, it seemed like buying was the better option if we could find the right place. We lugged our 5-month old baby around to lots of showings, lost out on the first house we offered on, then got the next one. There could be a whole other post on all the drama and details of that process but in general we were happy with how it all turned out, even though we were “nudged” into buying a little sooner that we had planned on.

I got a 5% merit raise to $106k. After taking the unpaid leave my wife’s salary came in at $64k. We paid down about $25k in student loans this year, $10k of which was a lump sum on Jan 1st to finish mine before we knew we would be buying a house. Opened a 403(b) for my wife and started contributing a small amount to that. Gave a “loan” to a family member that we know will never be paid back.

2019: Got another 5% merit raise plus COLA increase to bring current salary to $116k. My job started paying standby pay for on-call support, so I’ll probably gross an additional $3k for being part of that rotation. Wife’s school district went through a major strike and contract renegotiation, as many in the PNW did, and now makes $80k. We may break $200k gross this year combined. After pausing Roth contributions for baby/house preparations, we’ve resumed contributing a small amount monthly. Daughter’s daycare costs have declined a little as she’s gotten older; $1140/mo as an infant to $1010/mo now.

**Chart**

[Here is our financial journey summed up in one diagonal line]( https://imgur.com/a/I6erHLD). I marked the inflection points as best I could. Chart is from Personal Capital website.

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
3. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
4. 8/9/17 bought a car.
5. 12/19/17 – 5/6/18 accounts messed up (including retroactively) during the house buying/closing process.
6. 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
7. 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.

**Current Finances**

* $30k e-fund, $6k in an HSA.
* $204k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* $100k equity in our home
* -$36k of student loans remaining, to be paid off in 2020 hopefully.
* Current savings rate is about 45%. We were at roughly 55% before baby and house.
* Monthly expenses have gone up but don’t impact our long term budget, so our FIRE goal is still $1.5M.

**Thoughts**

###### Salary
In my original post, I was concerned about slowing salary growth. My job had just changed to a more rigid merit-based system of raises and promotions, and I do suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time, so I wasn’t confident on how I was viewed by my peers and management. It turns out that money is a good motivator for me (surprise surprise) and I found myself working at a new level of intensity to actually earn those maximum raises. I’m a lot busier during the workday now but still leave on time every day and have gained a lot of confidence in my skills and place in the organization, so that’s been nice. That being said, I max out of my current band 1.5 years from now so I’ll be working hard for a promotion to Engineer IV before that happens.

###### Net Worth and Housing
Lots of debate around here on housing and net worth so just going to throw it out there that yes I include housing in my net worth, no it doesn’t mean much. My plan for FIRE involves having a paid off house, but beyond that all my FIRE-related goals and milestones are simply dependent on my investments. Tracking net worth is something I like to do and is basically an arbitrary milestone I like to look forward to. Currently averaging 195 days for every $50k of net worth (starting from $0). This is increasingly dependent on what the market does but it’s fun to see how compounding has impacted this as each $50k happens a bit sooner than the last.

Being a homeowner has been a nice life change so far but not without its challenges. It was primarily a lifestyle, not financial, choice and I love coming home to it every day and raising our daughter there. Didn’t have many issues at all until just in the last month we got a leak in our water service line which will be anywhere from $500 to $5k depending on where exactly it is. You win some you lose some. My next goal in this arena is to figure out if refinancing down to a 20-year mortgage is right for us and pull the trigger on that if so.

###### Kids and SR
Dropping the HSA turned out great for us. Yes, we lost the great tax advantages but it greatly reduced our stress surrounding doctor’s visits and medical bills (again partially a lifestyle choice). It only cost us $400 to have our daughter off of a $30k bill.

Savings rate has definitely gone down but we anticipated and planned for that. I don’t know that I would call it lifestyle inflation per se, just that we have always built our budget around our priorities and our priorities changed when we decided to start a family. We buy used and get lots of hand me downs, and besides the daycare cost our spending has been way lower than I would’ve expected. What I didn’t see coming was how much more willing I am now to pay for convenience and quality. We have a house cleaner now that comes once a month (blaming this mostly on the recent threads here about how it changed people’s life to get a cleaner). It is definitely nice to get the deep cleans that we just didn’t have the time or energy for anymore. Wife upgraded her phone (from a 6s, so reasonable in my opinion) after we had friends always getting better pictures of our daughter than we could. In terms of quality, when it comes to my daughter I’m way more likely to get something nice for her versus buying for myself when I typically get the minimum acceptable quality. That’s probably just a normal parenting tendency and again this is a reflection of how the things that matter to me have changed.

###### Student Loans
Got a lot of questions on this last time. We are doing a unique program called Teacher Loan Forgiveness that is different from PSLF that most people have heard of. Basically if you work in a specific field in education AND your school meets low income criteria, you can get up to $18k forgiven after 5 years. No tax on the amount forgiven. Next school year will be my wife’s 5th so we are looking forward to everything hopefully going smoothly when we apply. We’ve been paying just a little over the minimum required for my wife’s loans waiting for this and paying off mine aggressively. Will try and knock out the remaining as soon as this forgiveness processes next summer. 

**The End**

Well once again this ended up being longer than I anticipated. I don’t know if this is still interesting to people or not but I guess my point is that you can achieve your goals the “boring” way, so if not, then I’ve succeeded? Beyond the monetary gain, the best benefit of working hard to save consistently (and essentially automatically) has been the ability to focus as much time and energy as possible on our little family. The financial peace of mind is extremely valuable to us as we navigate the wonderful and scary world of parenting.

Near-term goals include finally paying off student loans and the refinancing I mentioned before, figuring out the optimal way to save for college, updating our will and similar legal documentation, maybe having another kid, and re-prioritizing our budget and FIRE goals to give my wife the opportunity to work part-time. During this we’ll just keep saving as much as possible until the next major milestone. See you all at $500k! Thanks for reading!",financialindependence

He was all about minimizing effort and maximizing results in building his business. He wanted to buy freedom instead of ""stuff"", because, in his words, all he wanted to do was ""sit around and be lazy"" in his freedom.

He's now living out in India, enjoying his time out in nature on the ""Peepal Farm"", where he takes care of animals and people (and yes, sits in laziness haha)

Here are some key quotes and takeaways from the interview:

• Saving money is easier than working for it.

• If you're going for financial freedom, you have to decide what you're going to do with that freedom

• Cut out anything that's unnecessary. Don't follow consumption patterns

• Advertisements are designed to seduce you

After retiring he began doing charity work because he wanted to

• Lower consumption not to lower materialism but to lower suffering

Even if you don't consume anything materialistic, you still need to eat. Even if you're vegan (like Robin) and eat just a bowl rice, someone somewhere down the line is putting in labor and suffering.


Once you hit the point of freedom, you have to choose what you do with it and that comes from WITHIN yourself, not in the outside, material world.

This leaves out one important thing: They *had* money to put into the market on the way down. If so, that also means they didn't have that money in the market *on the way up*.

Once you have your allocation set (e.g. 80% stocks / 10% bonds / 10% cash), you should stick to that allocation. Sacrificing your cash position (or worse, your emergency fund) to buy more stocks could work out well, but it could be a disaster too. And if you had extra cash just sitting around that was available to buy stocks, then you almost certainly missed the chance to use that cash in the run-up before the drop.

Don't time the market. Choose your allocation and stick to it. Dollar Cost Averaging is fine, but that should be an automatic process that is independent of what the market is doing.",financialindependence

As long as you're making progress you're doing better than the majority of people out there whether or not you are in the best situation. It's easy to compare yourself to people who are doing ""better"" than you are.

Life is more about the journey than it is about the destination. Invest what you can, spend modestly, take vacations once or twice a year. If you don't spend your money occasionally (not every night out to dinner, on occasion....) you'll become defeated at the point of working so hard and forget why you're working as hard as you are.

As long as you're not going back in the negative and moving to the positive that's what matters. Health > Wealth > Happiness. It's better to take a lower paying but less stressful job if it means your health and after work life is better quality afterwards.

Because as long as you are moving in the positive you will eventually become financially independent.

First, she realizes the beach isn't on the list despite the fact that they pay a lot to live in a beach town.  Second, she realizes that the only things on her list that cost money are chocolate and wine (which also makes her realize that some of the things she bought to make herself happy really didn't give her any lasting happiness).

But the thing that stuck with me and the thing that made me write this was their conclusion that ""our spending wasn't reflecting our values.""  It was such a simple concept but one that I hadn't really ever thought about so clearly.  Our spending wasn't reflecting our values.

I'm naturally a saver but as I try to push myself to save even more, I keep coming back to this.  When I think about spending money I ask myself if this purchase reflects my values.  If it does, I buy it and I sleep easy at night.  If not, I don't buy it and usually never think about it again.  It's been a game changer for me.",financialindependence
679,Navigating the “experience economy” on the way to FIRE,,1167,apjudy,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/apjudy/navigating_the_experience_economy_on_the_way_to/,1549912841.0,"I wanted to write this post because I’ve seen a lot of posts from young people (late teens to mid-20s) who are on their journey to FIRE, who are struggling with finding the balance between “living now” and “saving for later”. There are a lot of posts from young people who want to save for their futures and build a financially stable life for themselves, but also worry that if they don’t travel/attend concerts/experience enough while they’re still in their 20s, they’ll live a life full of regret over what they’ll never get back.

&#x200B;

I’m not trying to tell anyone what they should or shouldn’t spend their money on – it’s a personal decision that will be unique from my own. But it concerns me that I see so much marketing out there, and so much social media pressure from professional influencers, encouraging young people to spend their money on experiences. The message always seems to be: “You’re only young once! You can never relive your 20s! You can’t afford not to do this! You’ll never get this time back in your life and you’ll regret not doing it when you’re younger!”

&#x200B;

For context – I’m an older “millennial” (always preferred “Generation Y” myself). And when I was a young person, the whole “experience economy” just wasn’t the same. Everyone spent time with their friends, of course, but there wasn’t so much emphasis on doing expensive things with your friends. Music festivals were a once-in-a-lifetime experience – not something you go to all the time. Activities like escape rooms didn’t exist. Vacations were something you would take annually with your family – maybe if you wanted to go nuts, you would take a cheap road trip with your friends, and go camping. Or something. But there wasn’t as much pressure to spend money on experiences. 

&#x200B;

It’s not like what we were pressured to spend money on was better – when I was young it was all about the brand name clothes, latest tech gadgets, and other materialistic things that I don’t think people care as much about anymore. And that’s a good thing. But my point is that, even though we didn’t spend as much on experiences, the time we spent with our friends was still valuable. We didn’t have to spend a bunch of money on concerts or travel or go to exotic destinations to have real friends. Real friends were the people who you could talk to about real life, who you could do stupid stuff with, who would go out for cheap beers with you, who had your back. And you can’t put a price tag on that kind of friendship. 

&#x200B;

So my concern is, I feel like the “economy of experiences” is trying to make you feel like if you don’t spend money on experiences in your 20s, you can’t be a well-rounded, content person with a strong friend group and good memories of your youth. And I think that’s as much bullshit as saying you can’t be happy unless you spend a bunch of money on shiny gadgets when you’re in your 20s, like we were told. Friends are friends and you can’t buy them. You can’t replace them. You don’t need to be rich to have them – you need to be a good friend yourself to have them.

&#x200B;

I know that the concern is that once you hit your 30s, you’re going to be stuck in life, restricted, forced to focus on your career, and potentially dealing with declining health. But how much of a concern is that really? I’m in my 30s, as are most of my friends, and most people I know are happier than they’ve ever been. Most of my friends make more money than they made in their 20s. They get more weeks of holidays than they got in their 20s. They’re in just as good of health as they were in their 20s.

&#x200B;

Hell, do you know what most people I know in their 40s regret not spending their money on? Cheap things. Because a cheap hostel is only comfortable enough when you’re still young. A cheap road trip is only manageable when you have the time and don’t have family/friends/job needing more of you. No one wants to go to cheap restaurants when you’re in your 30s and 40s. The thing is, older people I know only want to go to nice restaurants, take luxury holidays, and have more expensive experiences. The only people I know who love and have a great time with cheap experiences are young people. So why spend all of your money on expensive experiences when you’re young? Save some of that for when you’re older and can appreciate it more, and you and your friends are in a better place to afford it.

&#x200B;

And yes, it’s true, while the average life expectancy nowadays in a developed country is very high, there is the possibility that you won’t live a very long life. And no one wants to live a life they regret because they died before getting to do anything that they wanted to do. I understand that. But do you really have to spend your whole 20s spending your money and time on expensive experiences to avoid regret? Do people who built a really solid financial base by partying a little in their 20s, instead of a LOT, really die with nothing but regret? I’ve known several sick and terminally ill people, and I’ve never met one who wished they spent more money partying in their 20s. They usually regret things like their parents living to see them die, or that they won’t leave their spouse with enough money to live comfortably, or not getting to talk to their friends enough.

&#x200B;

So, again – I’m not telling you what to spend your money on. And I’m definitely not saying you shouldn’t spend any money on experiences – some experiences are a good thing. I loved my first international trip with friends, my first concert – these are things I will never forget. But there are marketers out there who are paid to try to convince young people that spending money in your 20s on experiences is a “need”, not a want – that otherwise they will not have “authentic” experiences, and that you will regret it if you don’t spend as much as you can on experiences while you’re still in your 20s. So I wanted to post that in my experience, you don’t have to spend a ton of money on experiences with your friends just to have genuine friendships. Spending more money on an experience does not necessarily mean it is a better experience. And when people get older, they thrive when they have a solid financial base and genuine connections with family, friends, and loved ones, not because of how much they spent partying in their 20s.

&#x200B;

TL;DR – having great experiences when you’re in your 20s is fantastic, but marketers are happy to convince young people to overdo it, and you don’t need to overspend on experiences any more than you need to overspend on material things.",financialindependence
680,Eleven Months Into Early Retirement,,1168,8g3umm,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8g3umm/eleven_months_into_early_retirement/,1525130114.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing monthly early-retirement series and my way of giving back to a subreddit that helped me tremendously on my journey. As these posts have become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend a great deal of the first day of every month on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. Please check comments and posts from previous months to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I no longer take the time to say so individually.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My maximum withdrawal rate is 3% of each year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month ($30k per year) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3% withdrawal rate is below the 100% historically safe mark of 3.2% for fifty-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20% above the original target amount (meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5% instead of 3% if restarting from the peak); and our actual withdrawal rate was averaging less than 2% of the original portfolio balance (due to earning additional income) when we received an unexpected $30k windfall (meaning that our current withdrawal rate is actually negative). The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 ($2618 adjusted for inflation).

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70%.

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**MONTHLY UPDATE**

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month came to $3471. This is $698 over the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 25.2% over budget for the month, 18.0% over for the year, and 19.1% over since retirement. We generated $474 of income this month from my wife wanting to work and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $2997 this month, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate is 3.24% for the month, -6.71% for the year, and -1.22% since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 3.47% for the month, 3.54% for the year, and 3.57% since retirement.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,130,151 to $1,133,244 (a 0.27% increase for the month), which went down to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,130,247 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is a 10.19% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $45.97/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $18.14/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $-5.68/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate. Dividends included, VTSAX (61% AA) went up 0.45% this month (0.26% down for 2018); VFWAX (20% AA) went up 0.46% (0.25% up for 2018); VWLUX (19% AA) went down 0.29% (down 1.60% for 2018).

**Reflections**: The overspending this month was due to a collection of vacation related purchases ($500), dentist/optometrist visits ($500), and my professional tax ($500). All of these were planned expenses. The market was all over the place again but ended pretty much flat. I try to avoid viewing daily market results, but they seem to have become ubiquitous in the digital universe. I am eager to see where the annual update next month will have us on spending and investing.

**Experiences**: I won the Andrew Jackson Marathon on the coldest day in its 46-year history with a 2:59:04, became the oldest person to ever hold the title of RRCA TN state marathon champion, and set a course record on the current three-year-old route.  I drove the entire way on an eleven day, 3100 mile vacation through 12 states (TN/MS/AR/OK/KS/NE/IA/MN/WI/IL/MO/KY) to bring my wife’s states visited count even with my own (49, no AK). The planned highlight of our trip, visiting Paisley Park, was cancelled when the blizzard hit. I highly recommend Garvan Woodland Gardens in Hot Springs, AR; Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, KS; Museum of American Speed in Lincoln, NE; Dana-Thomas House in Springfield, IL; and City Museum in St. Louis, MO. There was a message from a pharmacy staffing service on my home phone when we returned, but I did not bother returning the call. I was not able to convince my friend (making $70k/yr) with no savings/retirement and three kids that he shouldn’t spend $40k on a new truck just because he made $80k profit on a house sale. I spent way too much time again this month following the political circus. I cut back weekly running from 40 miles to 36 miles (still five hours but much less intense) and have started allocating three hours each week to swimming, cycling, and weightlifting (one hour each).

**Upcoming**: My time at the museum has run its course. I no longer find it stimulating. I plan to spend time volunteering as a running coach in some local clubs and as a pacer in some local races. I have a marathon on May 5. It was supposed to be a backup race for my first victory, but after my result last month, I don’t plan on running it at race pace. If history is any indication, I should be able to tackle it at a training pace and still grab the overall win with a new course record (small field). I pushed the three-week Japan trip back to next year. I’d like to get back to more reading, kayaking, bowling, painting, and watching classic films. Perhaps I will also do whatever the fuck I want. Perhaps I should remove “perhaps” from that last sentence.

Pretty simple, really. Don't piss your money away on stupid crap and watch your account balance rise.

An easy adage to follow in principle but a slippery one if you don't watch it. Be careful to avoid tumbling from frugal to cheap.

**When your ""frugality"" affects the lives of others you need to check yourself.**

It's not your friends' or family's responsibility to pick up the rest of the tab when you toss in your ""fair share"" that's mysteriously missing your pro rated portion of tax & tip.

And your server didn't create the system that leaves them relying on tips to pay the bills. If you live in a country where tipping's the norm...you either tip or you don't go out to eat.

From not offering to pitch in on gas to heading home tired when it's your turn to buy a round - tightwads are easy to spot for everyone in the room except for the tightwad.

Don't be ""that guy.""

A big part of maintaining a high savings rate is forcing yourself to go without...but no part of your plan should be mooching off of others.

**Lo mas barato cuesta caro.**

There's a saying here in Mexico that says: *The cheapest option generally turns out to be the most expensive.*

Being frugal doesn't always mean purchasing the lowest price good or service. Be smart about knowing when to go cheap and when to pay for quality.

A $200 pair of work boots that last 2 years is better for your long-term bottom line than 4 $70 pairs that last 6 months.

684,The 7 Rules of Money,,1155,f169o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f169o2/the_7_rules_of_money/,1581239150.0,"**1 - Fools and their money are soon parted:**

In the digital landscape, you will see many people selling courses. To put it bluntly, the three so called evergreen niches are generally: 'how to get rich quick', 'how to attract a supermodel partner using THIS specific pick up routine', and 'how to get a six pack in six weeks'.

This is a simplification but is not far off the mark.

Of course, there are some experts in certain fields providing specific and high quality information at a reasonable price - but this is the exception rather than the rule.

Possibly the most lucrative evergreen niche is ""How to Get Rich Quick"" and by the way this is not a new phenomenon - it has been going on for many years before the Internet.

However, the scale provided by the Internet means that it is more lucrative today than ever.

For example, if you are selling a $1000 course, you need to sell 1000 courses to generate a revenue of $1MM. You have to give a chunk to Uncle Sam, or you can set up shop in a more tax friendly nation if you are not an American citizen.

Using ad campaigns on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube and getting it out to millions of people, you can see why some have raked in the cash by selling thousands of these courses.

So remember that just like the Wild West, there are many scammers who want to part you from your money. If it sounds too good to be true, it is.

**2 - Understand what money is:**

Money of course has specific characteristics, but to simplify money is just the mechanism by which we transfer time and wealth. Provide value at scale by applying leverage (code, people, capital) and you will become rich.

**3 - Money can't buy happiness:**

Having enough money to be financially independent and avoiding financial stress *is* important though - studies have actually shown that financial stress can temporarily lower IQ. Not good.

In terms of happiness, some prefer to view it using the lens of excitement = happy, and boredom = sadness. This is generally more practical, as doing things that you enjoy and are aligned with some sort of purpose leads to a greater level of fulfilment (or happiness).

**4 - Beware of the Diderot Effect:**

In the words of Warren Buffett:

""If you spend money on things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.""

Now, we can probably think back to numerous occasions where we've bought something, and cringe thinking about how unnecessary the purchase was, and more importantly what he true opportunity cost is if it had of been invested instead.

We of course live in a consumer driven culture, whereby material possessions are the Holy Grail of one's achievement in life. This is starting to shift with the emergence of trends such as minimalism and FIRE, but it is still prevalent in popular culture and advertising.

In terms of consumer goods, there is an interesting social phenomenon called the Diderot Effect.

It is named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot.

Diderot was the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time.

Diderot lived in poverty for most of his life, but all that changed in 1765 Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles and offered to buy his library from him for £1000 GBP (which is the equivalent of around £178K today).

Suddenly, at the age of 52, Diderot had money to spare.

He acquired a new scarlet robe. And that's when the spiral began...

He noticed this is beautiful robe was out of place when surrounded by the rest of his common possessions.

According to Diderot, there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his robe and the rest of his items.

He felt the urge to buy some new things to match the beauty of his robe. He replaced his old rug with a new one from Damascus. He decorated his home with beautiful sculptures and a better kitchen table. He bought a new mirror to place above the mantle and his “straw chair was relegated to the antechamber by a leather chair.”

These reactive purchases have become known as the Diderot Effect.

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled.

This spiral of consumption is one of the reasons why many former Sports stars go broke after they retire. When they got their big break and signed their first contract, they had more money than they knew what to do with. Then, they buy a huge mansion with a colossal mortgage and numerous Super-cars. Their lifestyle expenses then inflate to obscene levels such that once they retire and lose their main income source, they go broke. They were rich, but they weren't wealthy.

**5 - Avoid the Lifestyle Inflation Trap:**

Speaking of lifestyle inflation, this applies to mere mortals and not the Sports stars we see on TV.

In his best seller The Four Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss, examines the concept of 'the New Rich'.

The essence is the following: ""Who is better off: the person on $40K per year but working 30 hours a week, living well within their means, investing aggressively and spending the rest of their time pursuing other passions, or the Investment Banker on $400K working 100 hours a week, sacrificing their long term health, and living a very expensive lifestyle."" Of course, this is a simplified example: the Investment Banker could of course come from a wealthy family and have an eight figure inheritance, there are exceptions - but generally lifestyle inflation is a trap and something to watch out for.

**6 - Money is not necessarily the root of all evil:**

It is possible to make a lot of money ethically - you don't *have* to turn into a super villain to obtain it (although it does help!). But if you view money as evil, it will probably elude you forever.

Money just exacerbates what type of person you naturally are.

If you a decent person without lots of money, at your core, you're still a decent person in the long term with lots of money. In the short term you may see some people change for worse, but over the long term you'll find they're fairly consistent.

If you are a...not so decent person without lots of money, you'll still be a not so decent person with lots of money.

Also, unless someone is a genuine psychopath, humans are generally not completely ""evil"" or ""good"" anyway - it is a complex and dynamic situation, where the very definitions of good and evil vary depending on culture and period in history.

So, don't view money as completely evil, otherwise it may prove elusive.

**7 - Remember the Goal is Wealth:**

Finally, something that the wealthiest individuals understand, is that money is emotionless. It doesn't care how hard you work, it doesn't care about the sacrifices you make to obtain it, it doesn't even care if you don't buy avocado toast, it has no emotion.

It is more about realising that the real goal is to acquiring assets and diversifying to create genuine wealth, and having sufficient cash flow to maintain whatever sort of lifestyle you prefer.

685,"My quest to FI, and how I achieved FIRE by the time I turned 30",,1150,4bbclw,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4bbclw/my_quest_to_fi_and_how_i_achieved_fire_by_the/,1458544724.0,"So while many people my age are just finishing off paying their student loans, I've worked religiously for the past 10 years to set myself up for the future. No one knows about this by me and my parents, not even my girlfriend knows, but we've been together for 4 years now and I'm going to propose soon so she'll get filled in eventually. But here is my personal experience with attaining FIRE and how targeting it from an early age helped immensely. 

In high school I had a math teacher that didn't teach because he needed money, but rather because he loved doing it. He had a bunch of rental properties and was flithy rich, yet working as a algebra teacher, just because that's what he wanted to do. He became my mentor and he helped me make sure I didn't fall into the typical pitfalls of everyone else.

For the first 2 years of my college career, I went to community college. Since I went to school in a rather well-off public school, there was just an assumption that everyone would go to a private or expensive public school, but I didn't. I got most of my core classes done in 1.5 years for approx. $12,000. I worked Mondays and Wednesday and some weekends and went to class the other days. By the time I was ready to move onto to a ""real"" school, I had saved up nearly $25,000 working and living at home. I'm still thankful for my parents for helping me at that early stages because if not for them, I would have had to take on debt.

I went to a moderately expensive private college ($40,000 a year), but I had scholarships and financial aid that dropped to nearly $6,000 not counting housing. I found roomed with 3 other guys in small house and paid just $150 in rent while the other guys paid $300. Made up for the difference by doing chores around the house which I liked to because I like to keep my living area clean.

Started an internship between my junior and senior year of college and invested what I saved and earned that summer and did rather well for myself, Graduated with a 3.5 GPA, a decent job offer in my low cost of living area, and nearly $40,000 in the bank. 

My first job had a take home pay of $52,000. These were my expenses for the first 3 years when I had that job.

Rent: $750/month 
Food: $250/month
Entertainment: $100/month (went to the bars only once a week)
Gym: $80/month (cheaper options were available, but I splurged)
Clothes: $100/month (outlet stores, kept changing sizes)
Misc. $200-$300 (minor stuff here and there)

I always spent right around $1,100-$1,200 every single month on my CC. I only have 1 CC and I paid it off in full every month. I got paid just over 4,000 as my pay, so nearly 50% was going straight to my savings. 

I got laid off in 2008, but I wasn't worried at all. I had a cushion that could keep me going for YEARS, but then I ran into an old buddy of mine that was in the construction business. He had the expertise and I had the capital and the contacts, so we started buying houses. 


Since I lived in a low-COL area in the midwest, our housing market did not tank as badly as out on the coasts but we still had foreclosures or REOs. We started small and the very first house we bought was a 2-bedroom/2-bathroom house for $13,500. It was worth almost $65,000 pre-market crash but it needed work. We spent $10,000 in materials and the two of us spent 2 weeks (10+ hours a day minus Sunday) fixing it up and remodeling it into a 4-bedroom/2-bathroom house.

Total cost was just under $24,000. We rented it out to college students for $800. We were extremely selective because we didn't want degenerates ruining our masterpiece, so it took a while but we found a set of quiet sorority girls that didn't throw parties and it kept getting handed down in their family from each generation for 6+ years and still ongoing. 

Once we started renting that house, the same year we picked up:

House A for $17,500 + $3,000 in renovations = $20,500

House B for $10,000 + $10,000 in renovations = $20,000

Duplex A for $22,000 + $17,500 in renovations = $39,500

All together I put in approx. $95,000 and Brad put in $45,000. We always kept cash on hand in case we could find a property cheaply that we could fix up. Our main goal was to find houses with a lot of sq. footage that we could remodel or add bedrooms too in order to rent it to big groups of students. It helped that many of these houses had unfinished basements where we could always add in pair of non-conforming bedrooms, as students were fine with it since rent would be way cheaper with 2 extra friends living there. Most houses went from 2-4 bedrooms to 5 to 6 bedrooms.


While we did have to scrape by in the beginning, since I was running off my emergency fund, and Brad's family was living off his wife's wages, we did whatever was necessary to get the houses up and running and ready to rent. We became more lax in our tenants and that did cost us later on in house damages but the security deposits usually covered all the damage.

Through 2009-2011, we added a whopping 16 homes to our portfolio. Most homes were bought for under $20,000 and fixed up for another $7,500-$10k. We modernized them with fake wood floors and always were on the scour for deals for stainless steel appliances since most of the college kids we rented to went to our alma mater and were rather spoiled. They wanted a rich suburban house feel in a lower-income area. Word of mouth spread and, we had more students look to seek houses from us then we had. 


I will admit that starting in 2009, our rapid expansion needed more workmen so we did get outside help. We found guys from our fraternity that were willing to work hard in the summers and we couldn't have gone through so many homes so quickly without them. 

Ben, our first help is now employed full time with us through our LLC. He manages the homes, set up a website so students can pay online, request repairs, as well as show off our homes to potential tenants. 

By the April 2013, we had a total of 27 houses (23 singles and 2 duplexes). Total cost was ~$930,000 over the 5 years we purchased them. We never had a mortgage and we flipped a few houses along the way to pay for properties we wanted to keep to rent out. Those 27 houses were worth approx. $2.5 million, bringing in monthly revenue of $29,000. 

Bradley passed away in a motorcycle accident. His wife and kids still have a share in our endeavor and they will be taken care off as long as I'm alive.

While many think FI/RE can be achieved only through working behind a cubicle or starting some crazy internet company or inheriting a nest egg and living off of it, it's clear to me that the universe works in crazy ways. I never thought I would know how to use a jackhammer or a radial saw but I learned and I put in the blood, sweat, and tears. I went to bed some nights in  the beginning crying because I had no idea what would happen if our only house burnt down and we had to wait for insurance and rebuild.

My message to you all is the follwing:

The world is a crazy place, and the we're all on a journey for freedom. It doesn't matter how you get there, as long as the goal/destination is in your mind. Sometimes you'll run into old friends and they'll become like family. Don't worry about money. Be happy with what you have and what you do and if you work hard, things will work out in the end.

My lifestyle has not changed much since those days from my first job. I don't pay rent anymore, and my credit card bill each month is a bit higher, around $2,000/month. I still wear the same brands of clothes, still live in a small home (although a bit out west, where it is more suburban, and still have the same old hobbies (insert shameless plug for /r/modeltrains). 

I will say this. Once you do attain FIRE, all those countless nights of stress or deciding not to spend money on that new car or anything like that becomes irrelevant. When Ford released their F150 Raptor, I wanted it more than anything. I even went to the dealership and test drove the first model they had. I almost was about to take a loan and pay nearly $650/month to finance the truck, but I walked away. It was one of the hardest things to do.




Current Financial Situation

We now have 3 employees, not counting myself. Ben is still with us as manager. We added Antonio as our full-time handyman. We also added Samantha at the beginning of the year as our office secretary, since Ben is getting too busy to take office calls. Our portfolio count is up to 71 total properties with the average cost being nearly $40,000. Not only have home prices been rising, so our cost to acquire properties has gone up, so has our assets value to nearly $6.7 million, als our income to nearly $128,000/month. After my salary expenses, repair expenses (averaging about $10,500), taxes, and Brad's share, my monthly take home is around $58,000, but I've been feeding the money back into it to be able to buy more homes.

The LLC is owned 85-15 now. We purchased our first commercial building about 3 years ago in a barely developed area of town out West for a minute amount of money, it wasn't generating a profit as it only had 20% occupancy during that time, but it was enough to cover all costs. As people have moved West, multiple neighborhood have popped up and drove up the value of our complex 8 fold and while the rents we can now charge are 3.5x to 4x what our current commercial tenants pay. I've decided to move on to commercial real estate and apartment complexes rather than single-family homes. Brad's wife doesn't see the potential and asked me to buy her out, so I will. Once I do, I plan on liquidating some of the older homes as they are getting to be nearly 7-8 years old and around the 10 year mark is where they get the big $$$ issues. 

So while I could very well, just sit on my butt and not worry about a thing in the world and just let it coast, I got too bored not working. We can only travel so much, since we have a long life ahead, I don't want to run out of things to do so quickly. I'm not doing it for the money, but I'm working to build a legacy. Kids are in my future, and I want them to have something to look up to in life, not as a handout but how to make sure it can keep growing. It's been a great adventure with ups and downs, but with Brad no longer here, I have no one else to really talk to. That's kinda why I've been typing away for the past hour. It's been 2 whole years brother, I still miss you everyday and I miss talking to you. This whole idea was yours and if it weren't for you, I'd have no idea where I would be. 

So guys, be mindful. Who knows, who your Brad might be... He wasn't just someone I worked with or my business partner. He was my brother and I miss him. We talked about getting a pair of matching Raptors, his would be white and mine black and taking them our to Nevada and going on an excursion, but we kept putting off and now it's too late. I think I'm going to go buy one in his favorite color tomorrow and take it out there. I know he'll be looking down with that idiotic grin he got on his face everytime we talked about it.

Sorry for the rant, but I have no one else to talk to about this. It's 2AM and I've been drinking away since midnight. If anyone on here has questions or wants pointers, I would love to help and pass on not just my knowledge, but what Brad taught me.",financialindependence
686,My path to $100k,,1150,c65nb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c65nb3/my_path_to_100k/,1561642800.0,"tl;dr Through a series of fortunate events, I hit $100k at the age of 28 on a modest salary, SINK.

I've always been decent with saving money, I attribute a lot of that to my parents. I didn't realize how frugal they were until I started making my own money.

I graduated in 2014, with a degree in mechanical engineering and not a clue what I was going to do with it. Fortunate break #1: I was able to graduate debt free thanks to my parents and somehow didn't come out an entitled twat.

&nbsp;

**August 2014 - NW: $2.7k** 

I started working at a consulting firm with a salary of $52k with overtime available. This is in a LCOL area which explains the average salary. Fortunate break #2: I was able to ""house sit"" a friends house who had relocated. I was living rent free and only paying for my internet. At the time I really didn't know much about personal finance, I just kept shoveling money into my savings account. I was a bit loose with my spending and ended up just shy of $25k after the first year of work.

&nbsp;

**August 2015 - NW: $24.7k** 

I still had some wanderlust in me from college and left the company on a good note. I headed west to a very HCOL area give the big city life a try. I struggled to find work within my degree but stayed afloat with an interesting job none-the-less. I wasn't getting paid as much and participating in a hell of a lot more ""experiences"" than before. Ultimately it was a learning experience and a very fun hiatus.

&nbsp;

**August 2016 - NW: $18.4k** 

Fortunate break #3: I get a call from my old boss, he's got a new position with my name on it. After some pro's and con's lists I take him up on the offer for $56k.

Fortunate break #4: Friends house was still on the market, more ""house sitting"" and free living for me. This is when I took a deep dive into personal finance and discovered this sub. I started contributing a little to my 401k.

&nbsp;

**January 2017 - NW: $21.8k** 

I made it a goal to really take advantage of my situation and over the course of the year I was able to max my 401k, open and max my Roth IRA as well as my HSA all on a $58k salary. This obviously wasn't sustainable but I'm proud I did it.

The guilt finally started to hit from living the moocher lifestyle though. I started house hunting mid year as it was honestly a wash between a mortgage and rent. In December I finally found my ""dream house"" for $120k. Dealing with all the shit in the Midwest does have its perks.

&nbsp;

**January 2018 - NW: $47.4k**

I had to dial my 401k contributions back since I had a mortgage to pay for as well as all the other new fun expenses that come with an old home. I was still keeping a decently tight budget and still saved a good chunk of change and finally started to see noticeable gains/losses (thanks December) that weren't contributions.

&nbsp;

**January 2019 - NW: $73.7k**

Same old same old, salary at $62k, cut back 401k contributions a bit more as I plan on replacing my 15 year old vehicle within the next couple years and would like to beef up my Efund a bit before that.

&nbsp;

**June 2019 - NW: $101.3k**

[The pretty chart everyone likes to see.](https://imgur.com/Fkaf7XK)

Thanks to a solid market and a bonus, I hit my first major milestone. Some notes on my finances:

* I include my equity in my net worth since I track the mortgage as well. NW = (Liquid + Retirement + Hard) - (Liabilities)

* The hard asset is just what I bought the house for. I don't track the appraisal value month to month so obviously my net worth could be more or less.

* I hold 100% equity across the board, all US total stock that tracks the S&P. I like to think I'll be level headed with a massive drop in the market, I guess we'll just have to see. I plan on adding in bonds in my early 30's.

* I realize my salary isn't growing wildly but I get decent bonuses and started picking up some overtime to bump it up.

* I currently track all my finances manually with excel. I enjoy entering the numbers at the end of each month and I don't trust Mint or any other free tracking software.

* Looking at the graph, I would probably be closer to $150k if I hadn't moved for a year and spun my tires. I don't regret this regardless.

Personal stuff: My major hobby expenses are video games, although I'm hoping to not spend as much on my next computer upgrade. I don't plan on having kids, I'll leave that to my brother and just be the cool uncle. No idea when I want to retire, before 55 is the current goal. Next big target will be $250k, hopefully I'll get there in the next 3 years!

I definitely wouldn’t be here without the help of a lot of people and these subreddits. There was a thread earlier that mentioned how privileged a lot of us are here, and I realize I’m in that boat as well. Thanks all for reading, feel free to ask any questions.

**Edit:** I track everything in google spreadsheets, used excel to create the chart as spreadsheets was a bit lacking in that department.

**Edit 2:** [My spreadsheet for those that asked.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZgCQmZfG26afAI1nHOp32OdhN48KX1O2kKBPDz3wME/edit?usp=sharing) I cleaned up the values. I only enter data for the row titles highlighted in light blue. The rest is calculated. I'm pretty sure I pulled the basis of this spreadsheet from someone here a couple years ago. Getting the chart to work is a bit weird since I opted to enter the data in reverse. Also I made the chart in the post on Excel in order to place the data points. Should be able to create a similar one in spreadsheets though.",financialindependence

I'm so incredibly grateful for your experience, advice, and taking the time to provide input. Thank you all so very much.


I was very fortunate and FIREd early, before 30 years old. I spend maybe a couple hours a week checking in on things, but I've been unnecessary in my passive income for a few years now (even if I wanted to spend more time managing, it would be pointless). The last couple years I have passed the time focusing on family and pets, watching shows, researching purchases, playing games, all the things I couldn't dedicate time to when I worked all day.

It seems so ridiculous, but I'm in a rut. I don't want to sit in front of a screen all day until I die. I don't want to travel, and can't travel for a few more years anyway due to my numerous pets. I pick up hobbies but still feel no interest in them. I picked up instruments, pottery, puzzles, sports (golfing, shooting, tennis), going to local plays and restaurants, nothing is sticking or consistent.

I feel insane, immature, and ungrateful. This was the whole goal of FIREing, but I've never felt less interested in having free time. There's little motivation to do anything if there's nothing to work towards. Those of you with a lot of time on your hands, what do you fill your day with? What do you look forward to?

There are ups and downs, salary fluctuations, job loss, career rut, unexpected expenses, lifestyle changes, the possible marriage which means possible kids, and the everchanging spreadsheet where your assumptions can change monthly/yearly. 

I have been trying to tell myself lately that it is OKAY to not achieve FIRE. Not achieving FIRE by age 45 for 50 doesn't make you a failure. More than likely, you will have more money saved than most people and the financial pressure will be lightened. If the pandemic has taught me anything it is that a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck and even having a little bit of a nest egg has given me some peace of mind. I am grateful for that. I see a lot of people on this sub get down on themselves (myself included) when they see what people are making, how far along they are at a certain age, and free vacations they get with credit card churning or whatever bullshit personal finance hack they are doing. Try and keep everything in perspective. Survivor bias exists more on this sub than people think. 

As long as you are conscious of your finances and at least thinking about your future and doing small steps to get there....you are doing better than most people in the world. It is not worth constantly thinking you are behind or ""Will I ever achieve FIRE in 30 years?"" This process is a grind and even if you fall short of the goal, you will still be alright. At least that is what I am telling myself. Take the trip that you want to go on, eat a nice meal out with friends, buy the more expensive toy for your hobby.

I know this has been a crazy year for market returns, and I'm not ready to pull the plug by any means or expecting the trend to continue, but it's mind-boggling when your investment returns begin to match or outpace the income from your day job.

Unless something goes horribly wrong, my plan is to retire from my current career in 5 years. Assuming a ~7% ROR, I should have at least $1.5 million in retirement assets alone, which will produce $60k of annual income (based on the 4% rule) and more than pay for my expected living expenses. At that point, I will take a respite from working, and then pursue something related to my passions (health/nutrition/fitness) that isn't necessarily income generating. I look forward to sharing my journey with this sub!

First, I want to iterate that I do recognize how fortunate and privileged I am to be able to achieve this milestone. I am extremely lucky to have been born without any major disabilities or health issues, and I am very grateful to be able to participate in a society where the opportunities and resources to achieve personal successes exist. Furthermore, I believe I was lucky to have been born into extreme poverty, for it ignited a fire within me to do everything within my power to escape my circumstances. I refused to allow my situation to define me, and I focused my time & energy on the things within my influence to improve my life.

Because I grew up in poverty, I've held a job in some form or fashion since I was 10 years old. The ones I worked in my youth were tedious and low paying, but they taught me to not be afraid of hard work. They also motivated me to find better & higher paying jobs, and to that end I pursued getting my education since I lacked any special gifts or talents for earning a lot of money easily. My youth was not like that of most people I know. It was comprised entirely of school, work, and study. There was little time for leisure, and even during school breaks I would borrow books for the subsequent semester to get a jumpstart on the material. Thankfully the effort paid off, and I was able to do well enough in school to qualify for some scholarships for college. I went to the cheapest institution I could find, and when choosing a major, I decided to pursue engineering as it suited my strengths in math & science *and* offered careers with higher earning potential, as opposed to one that simply followed my passion (art).

Upon graduating college (with around $10k in student loans), I landed my first professional job, which paid a handsome annual salary of $28k. I continued living intentionally and aligned my actions to my values & priorities. As Dave Ramsey is known for saying, ""live like no one else now, so later you can live like no one else"". I was accustomed to living in poverty, so I knew how to survive on a lean budget. Achieving a financially stable and secure life was more important and rewarding to me than stuff I could accumulate or luxurious experiences I could buy, which allowed me to avoid the YOLO mentality and FOMO mindset. Also, as a Gen X-er, I started my career in an era of disappearing pensions and the advent of outsourcing/offshoring. I watched good paying, stable jobs disappear overnight, and loyal, long term employees left suddenly without the incomes and secure retirements they had come to expect. That motivated me to treat my income like lottery winnings, and maximize my savings rate to ensure that I never had to worry about relying on a job for survival or face the prospect of being in poverty again.

I wasn't the most knowledgeable investor, and didn't learn about low cost passive index funds until my late 30s. However, I was fortunate to work for a company early on in my career that explained the power of compounding and the benefits of tax advantaged savings, which encouraged me to participate in my 401k program. I knew I had a long investing time horizon, which helped me to develop a high risk tolerance and feel comfortable with putting most of my contributions into equities. I ignored short term market volatility (which many of my coworkers had trouble handling during the 2000 and 2008 recessions, to their unfortunate detriment), and as I gained work experience & skills I strategically job hopped to pursue higher income opportunities. I looked for jobs with solid 401k benefits, such as low fees and generous employer matching, so that I could continue to take advantage of that savings vehicle.

Achieving any long term goal requires consistency and discipline, and the ability to break it down and attack it one small bite at a time--while keeping an eye on the larger prize. It's no different for finances, and each of us has to decide if it's worth making some trade offs today in order to have a brighter and more abundant tomorrow. I've had some people tell me that it's important to enjoy the present, as there is no guarantee that there will be a tomorrow. However, the reality is that tomorrow will likely come for most of us, so it's prudent to plan for it.",financialindependence
691,A different way to think about your FIRE number,,1141,hdvy9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hdvy9v/a_different_way_to_think_about_your_fire_number/,1592844661.0,"A topic I see come up regularly in this sub is about how a mindset shift can have a drastic change on behaviors and happiness. Related to that, I'd like to share how I think about my FIRE goal.

For a metaphor, I recently had to do a 24 hour drive. That's a long drive. I could break it up into 2 days, 3 day, or hell, I could muscle through it and drive for 24 hours straight. Most people wouldn't recommend the last option, but it does allow you to reach your goal the fastest. So what I did for my drive is establish ""checkpoints"". As I reached major cities, I did a sanity check to see if I'm alert enough to continue driving.

I'm trying to take the same approach with my FIRE goal. While the end goal to my drive was reaching the destination, the goal with FIRE is to be financially independent. The journey to FI can look very different - it appears that everyone is trying to plan ahead exactly what that journey looks like. My proposal is to play it by ear. I have NW ""checkpoints"" where my goal is to re-evaluate my path at each turn.

\-When I reach $500k NW, I could consider a less stressful job where I don't continue to save as much, but elect to have a longer career. Maybe barista FIRE is right for me at this point. Or I can keep pushing along at full speed.

\-If I continue along at full speed, I'll keep going the course until I reach $1MM. At this point, could I lean/barista FIRE? Could I reduce my workload? Maybe start investing more heavily in real estate and become a full time landlord? Or have things gotten better in my current environment to where I'm okay with continuing on my drive?

&#x200B;

This doesn't change anything fundamentally outside of your mindset. Doing this way allows you to stop fixating on how many years of grinding your job remains, because there is no set number of years anymore. That fixation can be unhealthy and make you hate your job even more.  Just keep driving down the highway - when you're capable of taking a pit stop, you can decide then if you need to take a piss or nap.

If you asked me what my FIRE number is, the honest answer is ""I don't know."" But that doesn't mean I'm not properly forecasting or preparing for my future. I just find it less stressful to not get fixated on a specific end goal. We're in the middle of a long journey, stop kicking my seat and asking me ""are we there yet?""

&#x200B;

Edit: I highly recommend reading through the comments. Some people bring up great points to add to this discussion. Some people asked great questions to which I expanded my thoughts on a little. The most important thing that came up is that your checkpoints don't need to be based on net worth. They should be milestones that are meaningful to your financial future - new promotion, burnt out from work, family member gets ill, have a child, etc. The important aspect is that you don't treat FIRE as a straight line, obsession doesn't get you there any faster. Everyone's path is going to evolve overtime, make sure you're in the right position to adapt to those evolutions. ",financialindependence

We realized duh, we want kids, so we had 2. My partner quit her job to raise the kids, I decided to leave my great job for a startup, then I got fired. Somewhere along the line we both started resenting each other and almost got divorced. That basically broke the retire-by-40 FIRE plan.

Now I prioritize my family’s happiness over early retirement. My new job is family-friendly and I’m in better mental and physical health. I actually have time to nurture my relationship with my partner so that’s getting better. I feel I make enough money and my job is good enough, so now I’m working on maximize my relationships.

I am confident I made the right decision. I knew I was going to quit once I reached the 10 year mark. I had been planning to this for over a year. I might be able to live off 4% of $800k forever. I am not sure.

I recently had some health improvements due to carnivore diet and all the sudden I am feeling less depressed and life is much more fun, so I want to go out and do stuff. 

My last job I traveled all over the world which was fun but made it difficult to make long term friendships / relationships. Now I settled down in 1 city, but I have very few friends here, and they are all married with kids and I am single. I have a job interview today for a minimum wage part time job. I want to meet people at work, make friends and create a large social circle with lots of options for stuff to do. I plan to keep applying for part time jobs at businesses with 30+ employees that are my age and hope to make friends that way. I may start driving Uber in hope that I can make friends that way also.

So I guess I barista FIRE'd. I did not plan it this way. My plan was to FIRE and then just play video games all day. But now that my health has improved I actually want to go out and do stuff and meet people.

Thanks FIRE for giving me the confidence to quit my job, I know I did the right thing.",financialindependence
694,Think I just lost my partner to a FIRE couple peddling an MLM scam,,1130,b8cd62,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b8cd62/think_i_just_lost_my_partner_to_a_fire_couple/,1554167343.0,"So my partner has been talking for many months about this couple that she's in a business partnership with that's going to make her FIRE within like 3 years. The story of how they met is the typical FIRE couple MLM scam story: This guy came into her work (retail) and started up a conversation with her. When the topic got to what he does for a living he said, ""well, it's hard to explain, but basically I retired like two years ago (he claims to be 30) after meeting a couple who retired in their late 20's who mentored me."" Then, he suggests that she can too and frames it in the way of, ""would you like to work here for another 30 years or retire in the next 3?"" She meets with him again, and he lets her borrow a book (The Go-Giver), which of course means that to return it she has to meet with him again. She does and eventually she ends up meeting the ""mentor"" couple and they explain how to retire early, ""**by generating revenue on the back end of online distribution.""** (this is important as it's always repeated but never clarified).

The whole while that she's telling me about this, she's also telling me it's about changing the way you think about success, and creating the value that you want to see in the world. Whenever I ask her anything about the business structure or how income is gained in any way, she repeats that that's the wrong thing to focus on and it's all about doing whatever it takes to create the lifestyle that serves her purpose in life. Besides, there's so much you need to know about business and wealth creation that it wouldn't make any sense anyways. I ask her if she has paid any money for anything and she insists that she hasn't.

I should mention that she started working a second job (overall working like 60 hours a week) in the middle of this and became very frugal because she, ""needs to be incredibly focused creating the future she wants.""

So this whole time she's also subtly encouraging me to meet this couple and go along with her on this journey. I should mention that she hasn't tried to recruit me and I know she's not out there recruiting other people. She also hasn't asked me to buy anything and isn't selling any products to anyone. She insists that this is a real methodology for creating wealth and she's met plenty of other people who are FIRE because of this thing. Again, I should mention that anytime I ask about how income is generated I'm told that it works, ""**by generating revenue on the back end of online distribution.""** When asked to clarify that, I get told that I'm not in the right mindset and it'd be over my head anyways.

This whole time I'm extremely suspicious and skeptical of this whole thing, but she's totally convinced that it's real.

Anyways, eventually a meeting is set up between the guy in the couple and I at a Starbucks. He gives me his whole story about how he graduated from UC Davis and was a few months away from starting medical school when he met this couple who retired before they were 30. He dropped everything he was doing, ditched going to medical school to be mentored by these people and now he's been retired for 2 years (at age 30). He says he can teach me how to do what my partner is doing but it requires me to be patient and have an open-mind. He frames it in the sense that there has to be a vetting process with me and I have to prove that I'm willing to relearn how to think about wealth and success in order to proceed. Once again, whenever I ask anything about how specifically I'm going to make money, he responds with the same line of, ""**by generating revenue on the back end of online distribution.""** Again, all 100% from the MLM scam script. He also asks me out of nowhere about pyramid schemes and then goes on to defend them and the MLM pyramid structure even though I didn't say a word about either of those things.

I walk away from the meeting feeling terrible, and when I tell her about my feelings about the meeting, she comes back with, ""there's so much you don't understand about this and he is the one who can explain things, so ask him."" So I have another phone call with him and just hear more BS and misdirection whenever I ask about how to actually make money. One big tell was when I asked him to give me an example of how some dollar amount goes into my bank account and he said that it, ""wouldn't make sense even if I explained it. You haven't run a successful business or have a formal business education so you wouldn't even know the first thing about it."" I tell him that the whole thing makes no sense and that I can't continue taking a strangers word on blind faith, so I'm done. I tell her and she gets extremely upset saying that my lack of trust in him is a lack of trust in her and that we don't have the same values in regards to this thing. She accuses me of not being patient and open-minded like she thought, so we can't continue with the relationship. I confronted her with how this whole things follows directly the MLM scam script, and she got extremely angry about how I ""believe internet blogs over her,"" and now she refuses to talk or listen to me. I'm feeling pretty emotionally devastated at the moment; just two days ago our relationship was totally great.

So my question to this sub is, has anyone ever heard of a scam like this that doesn't rely on recruiting/buying anything until someone is already deep in the process? Obviously the whole things just screams MLM scam, but she says they haven't asked her to buy anything or recruit anyone, even after many months in the process. My fear is that they're encouraging her to work super hard and save a ton of money so that after a while they'll say she's ""ready"" and she can buy into the ""business"" with some huge lump of cash. Does that sound like a familiar scam to anyone here? Or is there any chance that it isn't a scam and I'm just crazy? I guess I'm just looking for more clarification on how this  might work. I plan on contacting her friends and family about this so that hopefully we can help to undo the brainwashing to some extent and get her back to reality.

TL;DR My partner is deep into what seems to me a long term scam from a FIRE couple, but I'm not sure how it works as after several months she claims she hasn't been asked to buy anything or recruit anyone.

UPDATE: The support I got from this thread was extremely helpful, thanks to everyone. I got in contact with her sister who knew she was involved in some sort of business, but hadn't been told anything about it. My partner gave her some samples and she discovered that it is indeed Amway after all. On one hand, it's a relief to know what we're up against, on the other hand it feels miserable to be anywhere near this company, let alone to have lost someone to it. I have had 0 contact with my partner this whole month, until this Monday the 29th when she sent me a threatening text telling me not to contact her family and that she would sue me for slander and file a restraining order against me. Obviously there is no legal basis for this so I'm not scared of that, but it does go to show how fervently and seriously she is brainwashed. Luckily I am in contact with her sister who seems to understand the seriousness of the situation and is planning to get other members of her family involved in extracting her from this. I'm not sure our relationship can or should be saved, but as long as she's involved in this then there is for sure no hope and she will definitely lead herself into total ruin. I'll update this again if there is anything more to say.",financialindependence

Second, I believe that intersectional posts are relevant to /r/financialindependence, with a hypothetical top-level post about ""how to get started in real estate investing as a path to FIRE"" being an easy example. Last, I believe that FIRE is about more than the raw logistics of saving, investing, and withdrawing funds. This is covered in the first bullet point in the sidebar about what FIRE is about.

1. The central question
2. My discussion goals
3. My own answer to the central question

***

**To what extent is charitable giving, in its many forms, a part of your financial planning and life goals?**

***

Charitable giving can take many forms, but in general I'm discussing the wide range of financial behaviors that seek to improve someone else's wellbeing. This can be highly local, like planning to support your parents in their old age, or it can be totally distributed and anonymous, such as giving to highly rated charities through GiveWell.

I'm interested in starting a discussion about this for two reasons. First, there's a wide spectrum of opinions about financial independence from pure self-sufficient ""libertarianism"" (""everyone should seek to support themselves, and I don't owe anything to anyone even my parents"") to broad collectivism (""not only do I plan to support my immediate family and some relatives, I also seek to give aggressively to charity""). I'm interested in hearing a little about where the sub lies on this spectrum. Second, there's evidence that charitable giving is highly sensitive to social awareness. Which is to say: if you're a proponent of charitable giving and specifically of effective altruism, some of the best things you can do to increase the amount of charitable giving overall are to signal your giving in order to normalize the behavior and increase its adoption. So the second goal of the discussion is to create a public forum for giving so that persons who are perhaps persuadable or are on the fence can potentially learn more about the change if it's something they want to incorporate in their own financial planning and life goals.

***

Our household has recently committed to giving around 5% of our pre-tax income to causes that save or improve other people's lives. This percentage amount will likely increase in the future as our income increases. This change has been recent and rather sudden. I always knew it was a good thing to do, but absent the concrete need (acquaintance or office GoFundMe, family member in need) I didn't think I could commit to ongoing financial giving to charities in general. Part of this was that knowing what I do about savings rates and spending rates, any ongoing financial commitment means a measurable change in how long it takes to reach FI and the size of the account needed.

The first thing that changed my mind was hearing my spouse's openness to some small level of charitable giving. This took it out of the realm of an abstract thing that, if I wanted to do, I'd have to factor it into the budget, discuss it with my spouse, etc. to something that was much easier to get the ball rolling on.

The second thing was [this excellent interview with Peter Singer](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation), who has been instrumental to the creation of the effective altruism movement. Specifically, the thought experiment posited at the beginning made it starkly clear that A) my personal charitable giving would do unambiguous good in the world and B) I was absolutely in a position to afford it given I was targeting an approach to my finances that meant I could be independent at a relatively young age. 

The short version of the thought experiment is imagining you've come across a young child flailing around in a shallow pond that you know well. The pond is shallow enough for you to wade in easily with no risk to you, but is too deep for the child. There is no one else around to help and the child will drown without your intervention. However, you are wearing new shoes and a nice suit, and you will be out several hundred dollars if you save the child. Is it an immoral act to walk away from the child, trading your few hundred dollars of inconvenience for their life?

The natural consequence, and its real world application, is that there *are* people in the world who are dying from preventable causes, that by donating hundreds or thousands of dollars those lives can be saved, and choices to *not* donate and to instead consume at a higher level than is necessary have the same net effect as walking by the child drowning in the pond. The rest of the interview goes into the nuances and limitations of this thought experiment. 

**Almost by definition, anyone pursuing FIRE either is or will eventually be in a position to donate and save lives.** 

***

So to reiterate, what are your thoughts on charitable giving as it fits into your FIRE plans, and how did you come to that perspective?

**EDIT:** My deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has taken the time to read and engage with each other on the many thorny facets of this discussion. Besides the uncountable wonderful stories of others' giving, including their amounts, where they give, and most importantly why they give, there are also some very interesting discussions of topics around giving that I wanted to highlight in case someone's seeing this thread for the first time today and feels overwhelmed by the amount of discussion so far. 

* There are questions of donating now vs later, both with respect to feeling torn about sacrificing time or own financial independence (""put your own oxygen mask on first"") as well as through the lens of being able to give more later by virtue of using compound market growth. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdo17fh/) 

* There are discussions about how much to give, with arguments that fairly small amounts can have meaningful impact for a small non-profit, especially if it's given in an unrestricted way. [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdo649d/)

* There are discussions about donating your time as well as your money. This also has a FIRE-specific perspective of achieving FIRE quickly so that you're free to give as much of your time as you'd like. /u/Golden_Spruce has a lot of experience in the non-profit sector, and provides a wider perspective on some of the hidden costs non-profits face when using volunteers. [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdog1f3/)

* /u/neonnighthawk provided some sources of anti-Effective Altruism arguments to allow people to get a fuller picture of the movement so they can make a more informed choice about whether and how to give. [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdpt1h0/)

* There are also some really interesting smaller discussions about whether taxes are a form of charity. [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdo2wlo/)

* Of course there are also nice discussions of the financial logistics of giving with respect to tax benefits, including the use of a Donor Advised Fund in the US to bunch contributions between years in order to make the most use of the deduction. [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/fdo7naq/)

I'm in a bit of disbelief but I'm also extremely grateful. This community has changed our life and helped us realize that we can achieve FI. We have a ways to go before we reach our FI goal of 2 -3million but we've shown ourselves that we can get there through intentionality and discipline. 

I just want to encourage any young individuals/couples out there that this can be accomplished. My partner and I both work, and we split watching our child throughout the work week. (I love being able to stay home and be with our child. This is time I will forever cherish.) We are both 24 y/o and my partner works 3 days a week and I work nights/weekends. My Partner started working in her field (Video editing) out of high school and I started my business while in high school. I continue to run the business that I started in high school and this is how we got to this point. I also finished college and graduated with 65k in student loans. (Private college, don't regret the decision to attend, and also get angry sometimes at how much it cost.) \*end rant

Side note: My parents co-borrowed with me on my first mortgage to bump me up into the range I needed to purchase my first home. This occurred at 19 y/o and the agreement was to refinance after 1 year to get them off of the loan. This went as planned and my parents generosity aided in us getting to this point. Again, grateful for their example and for their help with this specifically.

&#x200B;

**Timeline of how we got here:**

**16 y/o:**  My parents told me they would not be paying for my college education but they wanted me to attend a university and get a degree. I never expected my parents to pay for my education but this conversation challenged me to really think about my future.  I chose to enroll in an early college option offered in our state for my Junior and Senior year of high school and I graduated with 59 paid-for college credits. 

This is also the year I started a business that would end up being my full-time career path. I'm indebted to my parents for their hard work giving me the opportunity to pursue an education AND for them supporting me as a young person with an entrepreneurial venture. They both grew up in poverty, worked their way out, and again set an unbelievable example for us to follow.

**18 y/o:** Go to college, continue small business and begin to realize I am obnoxiously throwing away money. Start to follow Dave Ramsey and begin the ""baby steps."" Meet partner and begin to talk about the future. This was pivotal in our relationship developing with financial responsibilities in mind.  Max Roth IRA and begin saving. 

**19 y/o:** Change schools and buy first home. I lived here with 3 roommates who paid the mortgage until we got married. (Parents co-borrowed to help this purchase occur)

**21 y/o:** Got married and begin aggressively paying off student loans/car(s).

**22 y/o**: Paid off car(s), and student loans. 13 months of working extra jobs, selling stuff etc. Found out we were pregnant, and decided to move to a home that was better suited to raise a family. First home becomes a rental and we invested in a second rental property with a 50% stake.  (Read The Millionaire Next Door, Rich Dad Poor Dad and listened to Dave Ramsey's podcast all the time.)

**23 y/o:** Became a family of 3, discovered FI/RE and decided this is the direction we wanted to pursue. We really reeled in our budget, began aggressively saving and chose to live on less than what we made. 

**24 y/o:** Hit a 250K net worth with rental properties and savings. We have a long way to go and the market could change. Encouraged to pursue another year of saving and work towards FI.

&#x200B;

I definitely understand that we have a lot of NW in equity and that this could change if the bottom fell out. Also, I have to give credit to my partner.  Without her onboard, none of this would have been possible and without this community we wouldn't have pursued this. Cheers to 2020.",financialindependence
700,FIRE @ 31 years old - 3 month update,,1118,ddglpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddglpz/fire_31_years_old_3_month_update/,1570238058.0,"TL;DR: Retired @ 31 - not as smooth as imagined, but still no regrets.

I posted in one of the daily FI discussion threads on the actual day of my resignation about 3 months ago, but I've held off on posting a compete summary of financial stuff until now, mostly because I've been too busy with travel and relaxing on my own terms!

Basic info:

* Left work in June at the age of 31
* IT industry
* Wife and I have been saving aggressively for the past 7 years
* ""Retirement"" coincided with an equity event where I converted approx. $500k company stock into cash

So, most of you will be thinking ""oh yeah well with a half million windfall anyone can retire early!"". The only clarifying thing I'd like to offer here is that I stayed with the same company for far longer than most people in my field (loyalty bonus) and I also received well under a competitive salary for YEARS up until the payout. Still, I will admit it was a very lucky break to end up where I did. The only credit I'll give myself was having the courage to bail on some cushy corporate jobs and join a startup for less pay. In reality, it wasn't too courageous because I was dying of boredom at [Initech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsLUidiYm0w).

Current finances have us (wife and I) at 1.5M net worth, with a paid off house and no car loans, etc... About 1M is invested in various stock/bond funds with Vanguard. Our expenses tend to run between $40k and $60k/year. My wife is also still working part time & self employed, which tends to cover our expenses for the mean time, allowing our principal to grow. She is still considering early retirement, but the amount of flexibility she has is amazing, so it's hard to argue against the income stream.

In the past few months since I've left my full time job, we have been traveling for about half of the time (7 weeks since end of June). Only domestic travel so far this year, but we love seeing other countries as well and the long term plan is to include some slow international travel as part of our lives. This has been really awesome and energizing.

Now, the other side of it - I'm already bored when at home. I have seen, time and time again, the advice given to ""build the life you want, then retire into it"". I was never really sure what life I wanted, so it has been quite a mental struggle to figure out what my purpose is now. When I was in my early 20's, my purpose was just to make money to survive. In my mid 20's, after discovering FIRE, it was to save as much as possible. Now? Now, it's a bit of a challenge. Every day that I don't have something scheduled, I do struggle a bit to find something to do. I'm not ready to dive back into the software world yet, because that brings up too many stressors from the past 10 years. It's a constant challenge, but I think I'll figure it out in the next few months.

Regardless of any misgivings I have now, I can with 100% certainty say this: Not having to go to work somewhere you dread every day IS FUCKING AWESOME!",financialindependence

* *2008 — EARNINGS: $5,000. NET WORTH: -$20,000.* Let’s start from rock bottom. I taught traditional art classes and worked odd jobs for less than minimum wage. Luckily my parents paid for most of my education.
* *2009 — EARNINGS: $6,000. NET WORTH: -$19,000.* My first internship! I was pumped even though it was drudge work the full time folks didn't want to do.
* *2010 — EARNINGS: $8,000. NET WORTH: -$17,000.* I freelanced and it crushed my soul. I made two dollars an hour for mostly terrible clients. One called at 2am to yell at me and I wasn’t sorry when his company shut down.
* *2011 — EARNINGS: $12,000. NET WORTH: -$14,000.* My first real art job! Sadly only for the summer. I also freelanced but couldn’t line up any jobs for the next year. I realized I hated depending on art for money.
* *2012 — EARNINGS: $31,000. NET WORTH: -$1,000.* After hundreds of applications to “creative” jobs, a tech startup hired me (my only job offer). Flush with cash, I treated my family to dinner, bought some fancy art books, and paid off most of my student loans. Then I got laid off.
* *2013 — EARNINGS: $62,000. NET WORTH: $20,000.* After intense hustling, I landed a job via my old manager visiting an agency that referred me to a startup (so bizarre). My dad told me to save in my 401k so I maxed it out and continued to do so every year.
* *2014 — EARNINGS: $88,000. NET WORTH: $65,000.* I worked like crazy and got a raise and a bonus! I saved all my money in the bank until a friend told me about investing. Work felt tedious so I applied to grad school for art.
* *2015 — EARNINGS: $93,000. NET WORTH: $115,000.* I rejected art school to work in consulting. The work was impactful and creative but also toxic and demanding. After my first vacation I didn’t want to go back. I learned about FIRE through wistful googling.
* *2016 — EARNINGS: $95,000. NET WORTH: $175,000.* I read about investing and realized I was doing it wrong. I maxed out my IRA and HSA, and made my portfolio all index funds. Work got worse: 70+ hour weeks and a manager who made me feel like the worst creative on the planet.
* *2017 — EARNINGS: $230,000. NET WORTH: $604,000.* I got married and we combined finances! They had \~$200k savings + $100k salary. I successfully negotiated for a job that paid $150k.
* *2018 — EARNINGS: $262,000. NET WORTH: $667,000.* My new manager rocked and I never worked more than 40 hours a week. Unfortunately the year ended with a bad health event that rocked me.
* *2019 — EARNINGS: $282,000. NET WORTH: $1,055,000.* I accepted an offer from a huge tech company for a stupidly high salary of $250k. It took 8 months of interviewing and negotiation.
* *2020 — EXPECTED EARNINGS: $420,000. CURRENT NET WORTH: $1,203,000.* We had a baby! It's been immensely satisfying seeing my child grow every day. I was shocked find out my stocks at an old employer become worth a lot. I didn't count them in prior years. We'll make a disgusting amount of money this year. Counting my lucky stars.

**RANDOM REFLECTIONS**

I've been very lucky. I grew up as a poor immigrant and everything I have now feels so fancy. My relatives overseas are still farmers and use outhouses. They work hard for very little and their kids are their retirement. This would have been me if my parents didn't dare to dream bigger.

The skill that transferred over from art was getting joy from the creative process. Even in the most terrible of jobs the hours would fly by when I had an interesting challenge to focus on. I’m really looking forward to creating non-digital things and learning how to use my hands again.

If I could tell my younger self anything it would be: don't let your job define you. I thought I failed as an artist, I beat myself up for not succeeding in consulting. No! My job is a tool to get to where I want to be. I see colleagues and friends stressing out and bending over backwards to be better employees, and I am thankful I don't need to do this.

Throughout my career I invested in myself. I developed niche skills in a huge growing market. I asked for payment in classes and education when salary was low. The setbacks I thought were terrible at the time helped me get ahead. If I wasn't so bad at making money as an artist, I wouldn't have gone into tech. The consulting job that burned me pushed me to discover FIRE (ba-dum ching).

Overall, our budget has held steady at \~$45k with inflation over the past few years even with luxuries like eating out when we feel like and traveling around the world. FIRE mentality has helped me zero in on what I value the most. When I think about dollars buying freedom, suddenly all the stuff and experiences others want me to buy feel like a burden and distraction.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**GOING FORWARD**

I plan to work another year to reduce sequence of return risk. If things hold steady I should be at 3.25% withdrawal rate. My mom asked me why I don't work for even longer. Well at that amount of money I have a WAY higher chance of dying than my money running out. I can't buy more life with more money. You can't put a price on spending time with your kid, exploring a beautiful new city, eating a home cooked meal with loved ones.

I still work on art projects as a hobby (or at least I did before baby) and I want to do more once I quit my corporate job. They’ve made a few thousand each year so I suppose that’s my insurance in case the market crashes or health costs blow up. More importantly, it's something that I love to do and adds joy to the world.

My rough plan:

* Optimize our last year of earning. Fill up the 401k, HSA, tIRA for me and my partner and get that sweet matching bonus + tax deduction.
* Enjoy big company benefits like massage chairs and free food. Get medical and dental things out of the way. Get TWO pairs of new glasses because I'm petty.
* Go on COBRA which buys me 1.5 years to figure out how to insure my family
* Maintain $45k annual expenses and cut during leaner years. It wouldn't be too hard to get down to \~$37k if we stopped traveling internationally and cooked more.
* For withdrawal, set dividends to not reinvest. Take the rest of expenses from the taxable funds on quarterly basis
* Convert company stocks to index funds and convert 401k -> traditional IRA and build a Roth Ladder. Do this as fast as possible without incurring taxes.
* Make a YOLO purchase of a fancy professional camera, the kind I dreamed about owning as an art student. Secondhand of course, I'm not fatFIRE  :P

We'll likely move out of our VHCOL area, hang with parents for a bit, then... travel around the world, build our own house, start a company? We don't know yet. It's a lot harder figuring out what to do with your life than what to do with your money. At least there are somewhat objective answers for the second. Luckily we'll have plenty of time for soul searching.

If you're still there thanks for reading through this giant wall of text. I hope it's helpful. There’s probably something that I'm missing or wrong about so I'm eager to hear what you think.

&#x200B;

**Background**

Last year [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ah0jem/update_to_the_2000_retiree_performance_using_erns/) about the performance of people who retired in Jan 2000. I look at 100% S&P 500 portfolio because a lot of people in the sub are planning on something similar (but mostly because I'm too lazy to look at different portfolios). This analysis doesn't totally apply to me: my portfolio looks very different; I'm planning for a retirement much longer than 30 years (retired in my mid-30s); and [I set my SWR differently](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/alf50o/algorithm_i_used_to_set_my_325_swr_from_a_retired/) and don't assume it will stay fixed. So why do I do this? For fun!

The data is based on ERN's [monthly data](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/) on real returns with dividends reinvested through Sept 2019. Since CPI data for oct-dec 2019 isn't out yet, I've appended to his data the nominal S&P returns for that time period.

&#x200B;

**Results**

Huge returns in 2019 really helped out performance to date!

* 2000 appears to be the second worst time to have retired in the last 150 years in the US (slightly beating 1929). This isn't surprising, since those 2 periods were also [huge peaks in CAPE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe).
* a 4% SWR still has 24% of it's portfolio. I really doubt it will make it to the 30 year mark, and certainly wouldn't be good for anything longer. Especially since interest-rate adjusted CAPE ratios are at levels that have always previously predicted below average (but not extreme-bear market) returns; see chart towards bottom of [this page](https://dqydj.com/cape-interest-rates-time-future-returns/)
* to maintain portfolio value (like you might want to if you're planning for a 50+ year retirement), you would need to have used a 2% SWR

Edit: Here is the link to ERN's data that I used:  [https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/) . You can use this to look at different asset allocations and to adjust other assumptions.

705,The 401k early withdrawal penalty is really not that bad,,1114,k78klb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k78klb/the_401k_early_withdrawal_penalty_is_really_not/,1607179176.0,"I often hear of those not wanting to contribute much to their 401k due it being ""locked away until 59.5."" However in my view, the penalty does not make the 401k an untouchable lockbox. All it is is a fee, not some illegal or super complicated thing.


In fact, if you were to FIRE, you could very well come out ahead by putting money into your 401k and then eating the fee vs investing in taxable brokerages. The combination of tax deferment, compounding growth, and effective tax rates could work in your favor.

**Quick and Dirty Math:**

Alice and Bob both plan to FIRE and each needs $40,000 per year to sustain their lifestyle. Alice has $25,000 gross income per year to invest and contributes it to her taxable brokerage account. Bob will take the same $25,000 gross income and invest it between his pre-tax 401k and traditional IRA. We will assume both Alice and Bob are in the 24% federal tax bracket, making about $100k/yr as single filers, and that they receive a 5% annual return. 

Using the 4% rule, Alice's FIRE target is 25x40,000 = **$1,000,000**. She does not meet the threshold to pay any capital gains taxes on withdrawal.

Bob has to adjust his FIRE target since he knows he will be paying the early withdrawal penalty (10%) plus the effective tax rate on his annual withdrawals. His FIRE target is **$1,225,825**, based on 25x ($40,000 + 10% Penalty + Federal Effective Tax Rate of ~8.4%)

|Year|Alice's Year-End Amount|Bob's Year-End Amount|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$19,000|$25,000|
|2|$38,950|$51,250|
|3|$59,898|$78,812|
|4|$81,892|$107,753|
|5|$104,986|$138,140|
|..|..|..|
|25|$906,814|$1,193,177|
|26|$971,115|**$1,277,836**|
|27|**$1,038,713**|$1,366,728|

**Summary:**
Due to the upfront tax burden at a top marginal rate of 24%, Alice can only contribute $19,000 out of the $25,000 she allocates to invest per year. She reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 27.

Bob reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 26, about a year ahead of Alice, despite having a higher target. He gets there first because:

 - He can shovel significantly more money into his investments each year
 - Compounding is working harder in his favor 
 - His effective tax rate in retirement (~8.4%) is lower than the marginal tax rate (24%) he would have paid while working

**Other Thoughts:**

 - If Bob had received an employer match, he would have gotten there even sooner
 - Bob isn't going to pay the penalty forever. At some point he will reach 59.5, stop paying it, and his nest egg will remain larger than Alice's.
 - Alice is going to have a tax drag during her working years due to dividend income, so realistically she'd perform worse (thanks to lurker_cx for making this point)
 - If Alice and Bob made between between $60k/yr and $80k/yr and were in the 22% tax bracket, Bob would have still gotten there sooner but by a smaller margin
 - If they were each married filing jointly, their marginal tax bracket goes down to 22% and Bob's effective tax rate in retirement falls to ~4-5%. He still gets there sooner.
 - It doesn't matter whether you plummet the rate of return to 0% or ratchet it up to 20%, Bob reaches his goal sooner.

**Conclusion:**
The early withdrawal penalty will not kill you. While this is a simplified scenario and your situation may vary, it's very possible you can eat the penalty and *still come out ahead* of investing outside retirement accounts. Of course there are caveats (don't eat the penalty too early) and **there are better paths than doing what Bob did** - diversifying your tax buckets, Roth conversion ladder, etc - but he committed what is often seen as a financial sin and still comes out just fine.",financialindependence

I can't tell many people in my life so I wanted to do a little celebration post.

I'm a 26 year old chemical engineer in the midwest.  I started working full-time in 2015, with about $25k in student loan debt.  I've been saving aggressively since I found MMM and this sub a couple years ago.  It has definitely changed my life for the better.  Most importantly, it's helped me deal with the desire to live at or beyond my means and instead focus my effort on being the person I want to be.  I feel a lot more free nowadays.

If there's anything in particular that you'd like to know about my road here, let me know!

Edit:  Alright, here are some more details about how I got here.

I've been working basically since I could get a job at 16 years old.  I started off making minimum wage in food service, absolutely hating it.  I knew I couldn't do that for the rest of my life like some of my coworkers.  In high school, I studied harder than I needed to.  I was obsessed with getting good grades and not disappointing my family.  I did enjoy some subjects like math and science though (hence the chemical engineering route).  I ended up taking the ACT and SAT and getting near perfects on both, which was exciting at the time.  It felt like a ton of doors were opening for me.  

I ended up applying to a bunch of Ivy League schools and getting rejected by all of them (best thing that could have happened probably, but it didn't seem like it at the time lol).  I ended up going to school in the midwest, meeting a bunch of lifelong friends, and learning a shit ton in my small, interactive classes with great professors.  I still studied too much and didn't have enough fun in retrospect, but I guess it set me up to be successful so I shouldn't be too hard on myself.  I ended up leaving with a bachelors degree, $25k in loans, and a dream.

I applied to 41 jobs before getting a call back for an interview.  This interview went really well, and I ultimately accepted the offer.  My starting base salary was $55k.  For the next few years, I traveled and worked a lot.  60-80 hour weeks weren't uncommon back then -- lately, I'm down to 40-45 as I get more efficient and have a more manageable workload.  Anyway, I ended up paying off my loans in about a year.  Then I started investing harder and saving up for a new car.  I bought my dream car, a challenger, when I could pay cash.   I have rented apartments/houses this whole time. 

As far as investments go, I have roughly 90% in index funds, 5% in short term bonds (might be buying a house soon), and 5% in a taxable account that I trade options in for fun.  The option trading stuff isn't to try to beat the market necessarily, it's just to stay engaged and for a bit of excitement because passive investing alone wasn't doing it for me.  I don't YOLO wsb style, I recently have only been running the wheel strategy on stocks I'd like to buy anyway.

I don't budget in the traditional sense.  Everything is set up to ACH from checking to my taxable account and Roth IRA.  401k and HSA contributions are also automatic through work.  I believe automating your saving is the most important step of all to be successful.  I shamelessly can spend any money that's left over in my checking account (I also have an emergency fund, of course) because I'm *automatically* saving over half of what I make.  Target savings rate lately is about 60% of gross.   

The more I accumulate, the less I stress about most things in life.  I think it's made me significantly better at my job, relationships, and other aspects of life too.  If I missed anything important, let me know and I'll add it.  Thanks for the positive responses to this post!",financialindependence

709,I just handed in my resignation - some thoughts on corporate nonsense,,1099,aokde3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/aokde3/i_just_handed_in_my_resignation_some_thoughts_on/,1549655764.0,"Given that I've asked /r/financialindependence a few times for advice over the last few months (or possibly years... it feels like years), I thought it was only fair to feed back a little.

So, I've been working as a management consultant for most of my career, being farmed out at various banks so my bosses can make some good cash.  With a FIRE-mindset, my challenge has generally been to leverage those opportunities and take as big a slice of my rate as I possibly can.  My current employer (until March at least) has been a bizarre blend of great opportunities, insane management and cognitive dissonance.  On the plus side, I've learned some key lessons that many of you probably have learned for yourselves.

1) If you aren't senior enough to win political tugs of war, drink the kool-aid (see, I even learned to speak like ~~a Yank~~ an American when I need to) as and when necessary.  In the past I've taken moral stands for the benefit of the group, but I've realised now that especially for FIRE purposes I'm best off picking my battles when it relates to my personal scenarios.  A couple of colleagues have recently been all-but fired (the bad kind) for pointing out some management issues during a blue-sky thinking event.  We discussed it, and realised that with our toxic management they should have known better and just trotted out the company mission statement repeatedly.  The point of such events is to point out how well the bus is being driven and how comfy the seats are, even if you can all see the volcano crater a couple of miles ahead.

2) Fight the big battles tactically.  I asked for some thoughts on here before, as my little British company was bought out by NYC-Megacorp back in 2016, who decided to slash all the benefits and slowly replace us with cheaper staff.  It was heavily recommended that I take a pay-cut on three separate occasions, and each time I carefully read the documents that HR presented, took them away, and then set up meetings with the key directors to explain the impact and how it seemed incongruous with their messaging to me about my performance.  In each case, HR seemed to vanish, and by pushing hard at review I managed to get a couple of promotions in with pay rises (I know, figure that one out).

3) When an opportunity comes along, grasp it with both hands.  I had an opportunity to explore a niche industry within the banks, and quickly built up a reputation for it internally.  I was attending conferences, writing articles for the website, and was invited into pitches for my specialist area, and regularly used it as leverage in reviews - i.e. who else can do this same work?

4) A liar is always a liar.  When the UK offices started to struggle in 2018, I was told that as a top performer I had nothing to worry about, but when the salary reviews came around they decided that adjustments would be 0% for some staff (me included) because profits aren't high enough (despite me being one of the most profitable staff in the company).  I told them I was pissed off, and was advised that I would get some adjustments in 2019, presuming I achieved some ethereal goals, but date and amount undetermined.  I thought that was bollocks, and told management so, but just hit brick walls at every turn.  Today, 1 hour after handing in my notice, I was offered a 20% salary boost and a guaranteed promotion in June.  I don't believe for one minute that this would have come through.  Either way, it was an easy rejection for me.

5) Have confidence in yourself.  I suffer from imposter syndrome a lot, and when applying for new roles came back here for advice - I'd repeatedly been told I was beyond the top end of my company's pay scale, and was concerned that other employers would push back, so thought I might need to set low expectations.  u/oracledba and others politely told me I was being a twat, so I took their advice and aimed big when I gave a target for my recruiters / interviews.  Some told me there was no chance, but one came straight back and said ""Hey, we like your CV and want to interview you.  But realistically, we can't achieve what you've asked for.  Our maximum offer would be X, but we have a very strong benefits package.""  With benefits, that made for roughly a 15% raise on my current, so I continued, and at the end of the interview process they made exactly that offer that we'd agreed at the beginning, which I accepted.  Perhaps I could have negotiated, but I was extremely happy and relieved to accept - and having done some negotiation up front was very comfortable with the figures.

In essence, thanks for your collective wisdom, and never forget that companies will stab you in the back at the first opportunity and the only person selling yourself is you.  And whilst I've royally pissed off the boss by rejecting his counter offer, virtually all of the team have privately congratulated me and are very keen to stay in touch.

* Job: Overpaid engineer at a Silicon Valley tech company
* Annual household income: $250k-300k, which is $150k salary plus $100-150k stock and bonus
* Annual expenses: About $65k, with half of that going towards rent for a run-down 2-bedroom duplex that's 18 miles from work (sigh, Bay Area housing...)
* Assets: $1.4M invested in 50&#37; VTSAX, 30&#37; VTIAX, and 20&#37; VBTLX, plus $70k cash. Investments are held in roughly 50&#37; taxable and 50&#37; tax-advantaged (401k, IRAs, HSA) accounts.

Tomorrow is a special Monday for me, because it's the beginning of what will hopefully be the last full-time work week in my life. Ever since my first kid was born a few years ago I've really struggled with managing my time and have found it nearly impossible to balance work, parenting, spending time with my spouse, my own personal interests/hobbies, and various other responsibilities. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a massive income and a fairly average lifestyle, which has led to me saving a lot of money in relatively little time.

At work I'll be dropping to 80&#37; time and will no longer work on Fridays, so every weekend will be a three day weekend. This comes with a pay cut, but I have enough money saved up at this point that I feel like it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the money I'm giving up would have been taxed at the highest rate, so while my gross pay will decrease by 20&#37; my net pay will decrease by less than that.

While 80&#37; time sounds nice I know that I want more, and I'll be attempting to drop to 60&#37; time soon. One thing I've realized is that my savings gives me a lot of negotiating power - if management is not willing to go to 60&#37; time then I have the freedom to quit and find another job that will allow me to work at 60&#37;. Additionally my department recently lost a bunch of people for various reasons (transfers to other parts of the company, people quitting, medical issues, etc.) so we're now very understaffed, which I think will give me even more negotiating power.

While I would like to completely stop working for at least a year or two (possibly forever!), I'm hesitant to do that right now for a few reasons. First, I'm not quite FI yet - I would be if I moved to a LCOL area, but I'd prefer to live in a MCOL area. Another year or two of saving money should be all I need, and while I could get there a bit faster by continuing to work full-time I've just reached a point where I feel like I need to scale back on work for my own sanity.

Second, the health insurance situation in the US continues to be wildly unstable and unpredictable. I can currently afford to buy insurance out of pocket with ACA subsidies, but I don't want to put my family in a position where we'd be in trouble if those subsidies were no longer available to us. We're very lucky to have Canadian citizenship in case healthcare becomes a massive problem, but moving to Canada is something we'd really like to avoid if possible.

Finally, I know that the current bull market must come to an end eventually, and if possible I'd prefer to work through the next market crash. I'm not completely set on this and may stop working before the crash if it takes more than a few years to happen, but if possible that's what I'd prefer to do.

My view of FI has changed a lot over the years. When I first learned about the concept all I could think about was early retirement - I wanted to quit working as soon as possible and never work again. I still feel that way to some extent, but I'm realizing that there's more than that to FI and that having the freedom to try something different (work part-time, take a less stressful job, etc.) is also an incredible benefit. It's really about having the financial freedom to do what you want and try different things instead of being locked into a career for several decades. And who knows, maybe once my kids are in school I'll feel less busy and decide that I want to spend my time working again :)",financialindependence
713,Just hit $250k net worth at age 27.,,1093,4oz5z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4oz5z4/just_hit_250k_net_worth_at_age_27/,1466435148.0,"I just felt like celebrating/bragging here because I knew I wouldn't get good feedback on Facebook (but showing off your new car is fine, I don't get it).

[Here is my Breakdown](http://imgur.com/KCAWvGs)

I thought about making a blog where I broke down each year of my working career from college graduation to now with income, expenses, and net worth at a few different points. However, I feel like I am your typical privileged poster on here. I came out of college with minimal student loans. (thank you mom and dad!) I got a degree in engineering and got a salary of 66k right out of school in 2011. I got a few raises and promotions up to $89k in 2015, which is ridiculous I know. Then I took a pay cut down to $75k a few months ago, which gives me a 10 minute commute and I am now enjoying the work I'm doing. I've been able to save about $50k per year and read a lot about PF/FI. (Edit2: I should clarify that my net worth has increased on average $50k per year, including the balance of my retirement accounts and realized or unrealized capital gains)

I used to pick individual companies to invest in, and made some good gains that way, which wasn't hard to do in the bull market we've had. Now I've shifted towards index fund investing for my personal investing and the retirement accounts are in Target retirement date funds. Nothing much to see there. 

My plan is to work for another ~7/8  years in engineering which should get me pretty close to my 4% SWR goal, then maybe switch to something that gives me more time off, or is something I enjoy more or is something to do with car racing. Maybe even sooner if it wouldn't involve a large pay cut. 

If anyone has any questions for me I'd be happy to try to answer them. Or if anyone thinks the world needs one more personal finance blog, let me know. 

Edit: Here is my [networth over time](http://imgur.com/b2TusLE) for the curious

Edit2: I felt like updating to answer some FAQs:

1) I am using Mint.com for both of these plots. 

2) I was very fortunate to have my parents pay for all of my schooling and expenses while I was in college. But since then they have not been supporting me financially. 

3) So far in 2016, I am on track to max out my 401k ($18.5k), HSA ($3.25k), and Roth IRA ($5.5k). In addition to that my checking account has been increasing by about $1k per month. This would mean that I am on track to save $40k this calendar year.

4) My paychecks are about $1350 bi-weekly, So $2925 a month on average after taxes, 401k, HSA, health and dental. Apparently I spend about $1900 of that on all my expenses. 

5) My expenses are Rent $825 (my share), gas $150, groceries $300, car insurance $100, Electric/gas $35 (my share), internet $15 (my share), dog stuff $100 . And I guess about $400 of miscellaneous spending a month.

6) I used to invest by picking individual stocks I've traded: CF, KO, LAD, PEG, BBRY, TSLA, RHS, XLV, VPU, GOOGL. 
Now I buy and hold, in my personal account I have HUBB, RBGLY, BRKB, VDC, VOO, VPU, XLK, XLV

In my Roth I have VFIFX

In my IRA I have VTI, VXUS and BND. (this allocation matches VFIFX VERY closely)

7) I was able to get my Roth IRA so high in 5 years because my previous (and current) employer allow roth 401k contributions. When I left my previous job I was able to roll the roth contributions over to my Roth IRA. 

8) What is my plan? I don't know really. I like saving money and learning about different types of accounts, funds, tax benefits and ways to save. I don't plan on retiring and quitting my job, I am looking to get a solid income from my investments to give me the freedom to not worry about what salary I'm making, maybe I could take an entry level position in a new industry. 

9) I am currently a Controls Engineer who mainly programs PLCs

10) I live in eastern Pennsylvania.",financialindependence
714,Why millionaires are becoming more common,,1087,cukhi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cukhi6/why_millionaires_are_becoming_more_common/,1566596947.0,"A recent post linked to an article about how ""millionaires"" are hoarding wealth.   And this is somewhat true.  But of course most wealth is held by people with a LOT more than a million dollars. 

I made the claim and some disputed it, that a million dollars is basically a normal middle class retirement stash.  
(EDIT:  I want to be specific about what I mean by this.  I *don't* mean that it's average.  Of course it isn't. The stats I quote in the next paragraph make that clear.  What I mean is that it is in the *range* of what normal middle class people save.  Most of the people who have a million (at age 60+) are normal middle class people, as opposed to the uber-rich or silver spooners.   It requires neither an above average income, nor an unusual level of frugality, just consistent savings from an average income over a typical working life, and *many*, if not most, perfectly regular folks do it.)

Only 10% of the population has a net worth of 1 million or more.   And only 20-30% of age 65+ households.   And it's an even smaller group if you don't count home equity.     So not everybody is a millionaire!   It's still a lot of money.   

And of course that's very true.   But 10% is a LOT of people.  Think about all the people you know.   1 in 10 could be millionaires.    The top 10% of anything are not super unusual, or out of reach living in guarded enclaves, but probably around 1 in 10 of our neighbors, friends and family. 

Here's the really dramatic part which even surprised me. [Look at what percentage someone who earned the median income every year of their working life would need to have saved to get to 1 million by now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QhFWaJtzioW2-PghvLIqydGV3gCsPafWD4mdSilet4/edit?usp=sharing).  The link shows the calculations so you can examine what I'm doing and copy it to play around with different variations.

Here's a table of start years (ending in 2018) and savings rate, and what that household would have at the end of 2018, with a 70/25/5 stock/bond/cash portfolio the whole time, rebalancing at year end:

Started working|Years worked|Savings Rate|End portfolio value
:--|:--|--:|--:
1973|45|7%|$1,057,193.60
1978|40|10%|$1,033,717.76
1983|35|15%|$1,016,774.04
1988|30|23%|$1,020,689.73
1993|25|34%|$1,000,828.19
1998|20|45%|$999,026.51
1978|40|15%|$1,550,576.64
1973|45|20%|$2,819,182.92

Remember this is earning the median household income every year.   For traditional retirees, these are not just very manageable but perfectly *normal*.   If you work 40 years, it's only 10%!  Consider that in a lot of 401k plans, that's close to the *default* now, to contribute 5-6% of pay and get a 3-4% match from the company for 8-10% already.    Do just that much for 40 years, invest it reasonably, and BOOM -- a million dollars.    10% is NOTHING.   You don't need to ride a bike to work or live on lentils and rice or grow your own vegetables or never go out or any of the other stuff that people do to get to 50% or 70-80% savings rates.  You only need to do any of that stuff to get there *quickly*.

So, the big caveat here is the assumption that you don't have any long unemployment spells or big emergencies, etc.   But that's still a pretty big share of people. And they are regular people. Middle class people.   This is what it takes to save 1 million on the middle-est of middle class incomes. 

Tell me again that 1 million is not a middle class retiree.",financialindependence
715,FIRE Flow Chart 3.1,,1084,drpj23,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/drpj23/fire_flow_chart_31/,1572907066.0,"A few weeks ago, I made a few attempts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dhr5kp/an_attempt_at_the_fire_flow_chart/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/djd168/fire_flow_chart_second_revision/)) on making a new flow chart that is more aligned with this community. I learned a lot of valuable insights and also learned a few disturbing misinformed concepts that are floating out there. Hopefully, the amalgamation of information that I sent to them directly, through comments, or on the flow chart in Version 3.1 helps clarify some of those concepts.

I'll be the first to admit that Version 3.1 is not the absolute perfect FIRE flowchart, but it is a, hopefully decent, start. My dream goal is to have it final enough to have it published in the FAQ, but I'll leave it to the community and moderators to discuss whether it is worthy to be placed in the FAQ.

Feel free to review [Version 3.1](https://i.imgur.com/o18MmOP.jpg). The one item that I agreed from previous comments, but haven't had the time to tackle, is to organize it into sections with appropriate labels and colours. In future versions, this may be implemented. I'd be open to seeing what appropriate sections would be best.

I also have it in my project roadmap to include appropriate references in the different colour-coded sections. For example, adding in the IRS Publications 502 in the HSA area/section to discuss what is considered a qualified medical/dental expense. I've debated whether I would link to popular FIRE websites but ultimately decided against that. I'd be open to hear for cases for and against this.",financialindependence

Live in the now to do the best you can to prepare for your future and not look at missed opportunities that will never come back,,1086,he5ixw,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/he5ixw/it_is_not_healthy_to_think_of_the_what_ifs_live/,1592876700.0,"I just read a post in r/todayilearned about a man who missed an opportunity in making $57m in Bitcoin by selling for $5000 and ended up committing suicide due to the overwhelming psychological imagination of him losing the $57m, not that he only missed opportunity.

The same can be said for those who missed on the dot com era, or even the big tech stocks. There will always be more opportunities, which you don’t always have to be seeking. 

I don’t know where I’m really going with this post, but it just saddens me that some of things we are doing can really engulf you mentally and emotionally to the point of harming yourself.

717,Thinking of beating feet and retiring overseas to take advantage of that sweet geographic arbitrage? Here's a simple test I've designed to let you know if the lifestyle might be right for you. (or not),,1079,ccprfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ccprfz/thinking_of_beating_feet_and_retiring_overseas_to/,1563027131.0,"Tell someone who hates their job or who is struggling with money that they can live off unlimited borscht in Siberia on 85 kopeks per day and they'll start packing their bags before bothering to find out that they hate beet soup or that there's no Bed, Bath & Beyond in Irkutsk.

It's honestly pretty crazy - but you see it all the time.

There are tons of folks who don't have a passport but are all-in on moving to Cambodia or the Philippines the moment their portfolio can generate $500/month. It's such a poorly thought-out plan that it borders on delusion.

(Cuz I heard you can live like a king over there on that - which you can't but that's a different rant.)

Short and sweet - if your primary motivation for moving overseas is to stretch your money, it's very likely that you're going to hate it.

That's not to say the financial benefits aren't real. Of course they're real. Exaggerated by disingenuous and/or pseudo-homeless bloggers - but real.

The thing is, though, cheap rent, food and drink isn't really enough to satisfy your soul for a lifetime.

To make the expat lifestyle work, you've got to love it for reasons other than 3/$1 tacos.

So here's my simple test:

Close your eyes and imagine that you've just won $10M in the lottery.

Now that the world is your oyster. Where would you want to move to?

If your answer is in your home country, then it's probable that you don't possess the innate adventurous spirit that should be driving the wheel instead of your balance sheet.

If your answer IS in a foreign land, though, and you'd totally be on board with emigrating when money no longer comes into the equation, then digging deeper into the concept of retiring overseas is worth your while. Sure, sans lottery winnings you may have to shift gears from Monaco to Moldova but at least you're on the right track.

\* The one exception is people on a very low fixed income and no real option to earn more - but this doesn't really apply to this community. In this case people may be happier to move out of poverty and into comfort even if their true preference would be to stay put and have an extra grand coming in each month.

EDIT: I think that most people are understanding this but just a quick edit here. I am NOT suggesting that this simple test is sufficient to determine whether or not you are suited to move overseas. Clearly such a huge decision will need to be analyzed from many angles. It's more a roundabout way to get you thinking, ""Do I really want to live overseas or am I creating a false fantasy because it's so cheap?"" I am mostly directing this notion at those who ONLY became interested in moving abroad when they learned about the potential cost savings. I also see, in retrospect, the fallacy in the test in that $10M would create a hypothetical beyond the bounds of reality. I agree that this test is imperfect but I didn't intend for it to be taken literally, per se.",financialindependence
718,The Top Regrets of the Dying - A FIRE Perspective,,1087,bxluwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bxluwg/the_top_regrets_of_the_dying_a_fire_perspective/,1559854463.0,"In 2012, a palliative care nurse wrote a book about her experiences spending time with folks who were in their last 3-12 weeks of life. She would periodically ask them about their regrets and over time had enough material to compile it into a book.

I won't share a link in the interest of avoiding supposed ""self promotion"" or ""advertisement"" but the author's website is just an easy Google search away.

Anyway, the top 2 of the 5 really stand out from a FIRE perspective:

1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

""This was the most common regret of all. When people realize that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honored even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made.""

Many of the folks interviewed at this time likely grew up in the 1950s or 60s, where the general template for life was graduate college --> marry your college sweetheart --> have 2.5 kids, a house, a car --> wife stays home with kids, husband works 35 years at one company and collects pension --> enjoy your 10 year retirement if you're lucky.

FIRE helps free up the time and financial resources required to pursue one's dreams, and unshackles you from the ""standard life template.""

2. I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.

""This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.""

This one's pretty self explanatory. I'd expect over time the responses from working women will be the same, and for the same reasons. I actually think this would be #1 if a generation with more working women was interviewed.

Based upon a conservative view that allows me to give my kids a debt-free college education and lots of travel money for 15-20 years, I'm probably at 90-95% financial independence.  It has been interesting to see how my views and priorities have changed since getting to the home stretch:

1. I think about major pending purchases in terms of weeks or months of delayed retirement instead of actual dollars.  Money is less important than time right now.
2. I have gotten more conservative in my investments.  My thinking is that a big drop in my portfolio right now would have a bigger impact (in terms of delayed retirement) than a big increase.  I don't want to push my timeline out any further.
3. I am still paranoid about the cost of health insurance before 65.  I am still working to get my arms around the expected cost, both pre- and post-Medicaid, but this still scares me quite a bit.
4. My focus on my health has increased.  I have much work to do in this area, but what good is retirement if I can't enjoy it!  I am increasing focus on being healthy and I expect that focus to grow even greater in retirement.
5. At work, I have become more of a risk-taker.  Why? Because I'm not worried that making a mistake that will cost me my job.  That doesn't mean I'm doing reckless things - it means I'm pushing me and my team to be the best and take some calculated risks.  My company has benefited from this approach, frankly.
6. I'm not longer sweating the small stuff, especially at work.  If someone's a jerk, I don't really care.  Life is too short to be brought down by people like this.
7. I am focused on a bucket list.  Now's the time I can start checking things off!  What do I want to do with my life?  What should I do while I'm younger vs. later in retirement?  Create the plan!
8. I'm thinking about part-time gigs that will allow my to still do some things for a while - maybe 20% of my time - to keep my skills up in case an unexpected need arose which required me to work again.  I also want to ensure I can do it anywhere so I can be free to move around the world.  The thought of doing a consulting job from a villa in Andalucia (or anywhere else) sounds very appealing!
9. I am feeling a twinge of guilt as I approach retirement.  I will be leaving a lot of people that I've worked with for almost a decade in my current job, and I've been a leader to many of them.  I know they'll be fine, but I still feel somewhat guilty about leaving at/near the top of my game.  Although we'd like to see our sports heroes retire at the top, it's harder when you're talking about yourself.

723,Two Years Into Early Retirement,,1074,bw9hgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bw9hgr/two_years_into_early_retirement/,1559560573.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Introduction**: This post is part of an early-retirement series. Biennial updates will be made around June 1 (near retirement anniversary) and January 1 (end of year finances). As these posts have become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend nearly an entire day on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. I’ll try my best to stick around for a bit, but please check comments and posts from previous posts to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I might no longer take the time to say so individually. I apologize if I don’t remember you individually. The usernames and stories run together. Please remind me of a discussion we had or provide a link if it’s relevant to something you want to know.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My maximum withdrawal rate is 3% of each year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. My maximum spending rate is the maximum withdrawal plus income earned outside of employment for the sake of income. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500/mo ($30k/yr) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3% withdrawal rate is below the 100% historically safe mark of 3.2% for fifty-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market has peaked us more than 20% above our $1M target (meaning that $36k annually is actually a 3% withdrawal rate if restarting from the peak); and our actual withdrawal rate is much less than 3% due to earning additional income and an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018 (placing our actual withdrawal rate well below 1%). The budgeted withdrawal amount for 2019 is $2638/mo or $31,656/yr. In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2676/mo adjusted for inflation). In 2018, it was $2773/mo ($2834/mo adjusted for inflation).

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average.

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (reverse mortgage with no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**YEAR TWO RECAP**

**Spending**: Living expenses for the year came to $39,954. This is $7,353 over the targeted amount of $32,601. Our spending was 22.6% over budget for the year and 18.8% over since retirement. We generated $13,263 of income this year mainly from my wife wanting to work part time (not for money). Our investment withdrawal was $26,691 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 2.37% for the year, and 0.81% since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our annually-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 3.68% for the year, and 3.56% since retirement.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,025,772 (year zero) to $1,146,164 (year one) to $1,138,092 (year two). This is a 0.99% decrease for the year, but a 10.95% increase from the start. Dividends included, VTSAX (60% AA) went up 1.48% this year; VFWAX (20% AA) went down 6.18% this year; VWLUX (20% AA) went up 6.58% this year. Overall, investments went up 0.97% this year.

**Reflections**: A wild year for the market, but everything seems to be going as planned. We entered year two of early retirement at $1.146M on 6/1, peaked at $1.199M on 9/20, bottomed at $1.008M on 12/24, peaked again at $1.202M on 5/3, and finished back down at $1.138M. I can’t say that I ever gave serious thought to converting stocks to a more stable form of investment, but it did often cross my mind. Sure, I wish I had temporarily jumped out near the market peak, but I’m also glad I didn’t jump out in 2008/2010/2011/2015 when dart throwing monkeys were howling just as loud as ever. I don’t know how this imbecilic and unnecessary trade war nonsense is going to work itself out, but Wall Street definitely views it as imbecilic and entirely unnecessary. What I view as entirely unnecessary is the existence of a representative democracy that allows imbeciles to have an equal say with intellectuals. What I view as intriguing is the thought of wearing an infinity gauntlet, but that’s another story for another day. On the other hand (literally), this whole process doesn’t work without imbeciles, so maybe everyone can stay and report to rehabilitation camps instead.

**Experiences**: I consider these to be the highlights of my second year in early retirement: ran over 2000 miles, broke three hours in a marathon for the third and fourth time (third one is my current PR at 2:48:30, fourth one was on the toughest road course in the southeast at 2:57:56 which is the course record by over 36 minutes), lowered my half-marathon PR (from 1:25:04 to 1:21:06 in October, then 1:19:57 in February, then 1:19:43 in April which was enough to win the state championship), set a personal record in the 1500m swim (finally getting under 2:00/100yd pace with the help of a wetsuit), took my first solo vacation in many years (went to New Orleans for a day and was bored to tears), played disc golf for the first time in over thirty years (better at this than normal golf), continued to write in my daily journal every single day since retirement without exception (focusing on weird dreams), took up the occasional evisceration of intellectually handicapped people who say stupid things in local facebook groups (no shortage of idiots in this part of the country), tackled all of my CE requirements (including 15 hours of article examinations in 45 minutes – broken system), became a certified volunteer ESL teacher for a semester with a nonprofit program (teaching intermediate level classes in English), volunteered in a voter registration drive at a small library branch (no one showed up), volunteered as a 1:30 pacer in a charity half marathon (always great to offer comedic relief when running at a pace that most people can only dream of), squandered hundreds of hours playing PS4 games (Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age, Final Fantasy XV, Dragon Quest XI, Ni No Kuni 2, Spider-Man, Fallout 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition, GTA V, and Persona 5 – I didn’t care much for Red Dead Redemption 2 or God of War – there were others that were quicker plays), increased my count to 650+ movies on TSPDT 1000 (including 430+ of the top 500), collected some more vintage sports cards (pictures of men with moustaches), completed and self-published my sci-fi novella (Remember I Was Vapour), interviewed for and dealt with the fallout from five media articles (more on this below), participated in an apparently abandoned 60-second doc on financial independence (not sure why it was ditched), participated in an apparently abandoned financial pharmacist podcast (perhaps I spent too much time degrading the profession instead of talking about the topic of the show – early retirement, if I recall the topic correctly), applied for and turned down a non-retail pharmacy job offer (applied on a whim and got an offer fifteen minutes later, plus a bad commute and onset of panic), helped my parents do repairs (roof, gutters, tractor, etc.), built a new mailbox (for UPS packages and such), did a lot of litter pickup (before this trendy but wonderful trashtag thing started), made preliminary but detailed itineraries for several future vacations (Japan #2, Japan #3, Denmark/Sweden/Norway, California #2, Portugal/Spain/Morocco, Uganda/Tanzania, Australia/NZ, Egypt/Greece, Finland/Russia, UK, Latin America, SE Asia), dealt with the brief emotional impact of having my best friend from ninth grade commit suicide (I’m fine, but seriously, don’t ask), and celebrated my 40th birthday by doing a blitzkrieg of stuff that I loved growing up.

**Media**: I was featured in two NYT articles, two Business Insider articles, and one Big Think article. I even created a blog for the sole purpose of getting some amazon click-thru revenue from those NYT articles. Three of my real-life friends saw the first NYT article (style section) without me mentioning it to anyone I know. However those articles failed to include a proper link to my blog because some idiotic web designer didn’t know what the hell he/she was doing. You would not believe the amount of incompetence and the explanations I was getting from that end. Sorry, I don’t feel like reliving it in detail. They eventually fixed their mess, but it was far too late to make a difference for traffic flow. Still, this didn’t stop a legion of people from stalking me on strava and facebook. I had to politely turn away most of the people who wanted to meet up, but I made time for most fellow marathoners, pharmacists, and redditors. Hopefully my fifteen minutes have passed. I might shut down the blog because I don’t really do anything with it. I refused pictures, and I’m glad I did since they successfully made the participants look like total douchebags. And coming from me, that’s saying something.

**Routine**: Comparing my daily habits in year two compared to pre-retirement, I increased my swimming (currently on hiatus), weightlifting (on hiatus), volunteering (on hiatus), hiking (several treks), movie watching, puzzle solving, family time, housework, yardwork, cooking, kayaking, stargazing, socializing, painting, bowling, videogame playing, reading (20-30 books), writing, studying astronomy, napping, and watching television (Game of Thrones, Arrested Development [new seasons], Cosmos [fifth time], Parts Unknown). Things I failed to make much progress on were learning to play an instrument (lack of talent and interest), improving my Spanish and Japanese (other than ESL class – and I pushed the second three-week Japan vacation back again to 2021), being able to bench press my body weight (tough hill to climb, and running takes all of my energy), helping fight the opiate epidemic in online discussions (dealing with imbecilic addicts who know nothing beyond anecdotes, personal attacks, and fallacious logic is wearisome), reducing internet time (tough to turn away when a particular group is responsible for the moral and intellectual erosion of the country), and deconverting religious adherents (taking a long break).

**Upcoming**: What lies ahead in year three? I plan on running 3000+ miles and participating in a few more races before leaving competition (including a return to the 10-miler that I placed 50th in four years ago, now with hopes of an overall victory and a nearly certain 40+ category victory). I hope to help a friend of mine earn his first sub-three marathon and subsequently accompany him to Boston in 2020 as my final competitive race, but that’s mostly up to him. I would like to break five minutes for the mile (probably will not happen) and 2:45 for the marathon (should be in the bag on the next attempt). I have indefinitely postponed plans for a triathlon due to a total lack of interest in competitive cycling and swimming (and a lack of preparedness by the guy I was going to participate with). A two week trip to Alaska/Washington/Victoria including an overnight backpack in Denali is coming up very soon. Perhaps there will be another trip somewhere in the spring. I’d like to expand the novella to a novel or convert it to a movie script. I’d like to hit 700 on TSPDT 1000. I’d like to bowl a 600 three-game series. I’d like to solve Rubik’s cube in less than one minute. I’d like to expand my understanding of relativity and quantum theories. I need to find some new things to do because it kinda feels like I’m running out of ideas. I need to get out of the house more. I need to worry about volunteering less and focus more on doing things for myself. I need to worry less in general, but I also want to continue making small improvements to the world. I want to enjoy life. I want to do whatever the fuck I want. And I shall. Right after I finish answering some idiotic questions.",financialindependence
724,$1 Million Net Worth - Using Exact Advice Advocated on These Forums,,1080,88k7q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/88k7q6/1_million_net_worth_using_exact_advice_advocated/,1522517727.0,"I hit a major FI milestone today - $1 million net worth ($1,010,261) - and wanted to share as encouragement for those like myself who constantly look at their projections, often daunted, wondering when they’ll hit certain points along the way.

I used to graph out projected FI milestones on a near daily basis at work. I would feel overwhelmed by how far out those dates seemed. Rest assured, that time passes faster than you expect!

Some background: I grew up in a family that struggled financially, living paycheck to paycheck. I began teaching and performing music for income at a young age (14) and would contribute to household expenses. My father was unemployed the vast majority of the time and I decided early on I didn’t want to have those same struggles over buying groceries later in life.

I went to a fairly prestigious university - 95% covered through scholarship and work study. Thankfully didn’t graduate with much debt. I graduated college in 2009, at the bottom of the recession, which helped further instill a frugal lifestyle.

After reading books like Walden I realized I need very little to feel fulfilled and happy. I would view it as a game, taking backpacking trips through foreign countries, not spending a dime of my own $ and playing street music to pay for hostels and meals. In 2012, despite having a decent job with $63k salary, and ~$90k saved up, I decided to sublet my apartment for 4 months and squatted in an abandoned building next to where I worked (extreme, I know). Notably I had a great time doing this and it wasn’t quite as destitute as it sounds.

While on a high bike ride in a forest preserve one day (took a half day from work) I decided I wanted to have the option to bike, read, or travel whenever I wanted without the burden of day jobs. This is when I began aggressively formulating investment strategy and churning through the classic FI books and forums to reach that end-goal. MMM, MadFIentist, and Jlcollinsnh have been invaluable tools. It was so reassuring to hear about entire communities built around the FI concept.

In 2013 I purchased a multi-unit apartment building that cash-flowed enough to cover all of my living expenses - with me living in the cheapest, basement unit. From that point on, 100% of every dollar I made could be invested. The Intelligent Investor and Four Pillars of Investing have been integral in shaping my portfolio over the years.

From there it’s just been a slow build to today. I’m mostly an index investor and my paychecks go straight to my Vanguard account. It feels great having F-you money, as Jim Collins says. I quit a soul-sucking job this past year and took 8 months to myself as a trial FIRE. It was amazing. I expect to pull the trigger and officially FIRE sometime within the next two years.

If it were just me I’d have FIREd years ago. Now my primary concern is covering my mother’s retirement in its entirety. If anyone has much experience in this area I’d love to hear it!

TL;DR Surpassed $1 million net worth through extreme frugal living, a multi-family RE purchase to cover my living costs, and subsequent index investing.

725,I feel like a chump for investing in my future at the expense of the best years of my life.,,1073,jtutfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jtutfs/i_feel_like_a_chump_for_investing_in_my_future_at/,1605324022.0,"I’ve recently turned 40, which is essentially middle age, and my resentment towards sacrificing the enjoyment of my present life continues to grow. Financially, I would consider myself both fortunate and comfortable. My wife and I are both established in our careers, and combine for a gross income of $250K-ish Canadian. We have 3 lovely children, though we’re “old parents” for having them in our mid to late 30’s.

I’m sure 60 or 70 year old me will be thankful, but I feel like I’m sacrificing the middle third of my life for a future that is not guaranteed. Friends in similar positions are enjoying new(er) and large(r) homes, vehicles, family vacations (pre-COVID), etc., while I’m living in a 1000sqft bungalow built in 1956 and drive vehicles 10-15 years old. My wife and I had to accomplish everything “the hard way” and had little to no financial assistance from our parents. They just didn’t have to ability to help in that capacity. Many of our friends were able to live at home during university, paid very little tuition on their own, received assistance on home down payments, purchased their first home before the housing boom, made a small fortune selling their first home and are now on their second... gah! My wife and I lived on our own and paid our own way through university, bought our home at the housing market peak, and on and on.

Quite frankly, I’m unhappy with my daily life, and the promise of a comfortable retirement is not compensating for my growing resentment. It’s because all our income not dedicated towards living expenses (mortgage, utilities, food, childcare, etc.) is being saved an invested. Though we both have retirement plans through work, we have secondary RSP’s through our financial planner. RESP’s are in place for our 3 children. After allowing ourselves a minimal monthly “allowance” everything else is put in to savings. Our net worth (assets vs liabilities) is already over the million dollar mark, our mortgage will be paid off in less than 5 years, vehicles were bought with cash, and we have no other debts.

And I fucking hate it. It’s a bizarre feeling, because I should feel comfortable and content, but I feel trapped and limited. Most days I couldn’t care less that 80 year old me, if I live that long, will be taken care of because 40 year old me is being “fiscally responsible.” My apologies for the rant, but I really needed a non-spouse outlet to vent.

Here is a sampling of my monthly budget:

Based on $12K/mo take-home (net) income.

$1800 - childcare

$1530 - mortgage

$1105 - utilities, insurance, taxes

$300 - transportation

$800 - groceries

$50 - charity

$200 - personal allowance ($100 each)

$6215 - RESP, RSPs, savings

Both my wife and I also have retirement savings/investments deducted automatically off our paycheques. I did not include this. I’m coming at you from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Heathcare expenses, both now and in my old-age, are of minimal to zero concern.

EDIT: Thank you, truly. The responses have been both appreciated (all of them) and overwhelming. I couldn’t even begin to address them all, but I have given each reply my attention. Thank you.",financialindependence

727,5 investment steps I'm taking in a bear market. 4 more I would take if I could.,,1079,flx7te,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/flx7te/5_investment_steps_im_taking_in_a_bear_market_4/,1584719316.0,"A lot of people are asking what to do in the midst of a bear market. Here are some decisions I’m making as a \~30 year old pursuing FI with an aggressive risk tolerance. I think of all of the items below as more productive financial planning moves than agonizing over falling account balances. Obviously your situation is your own, but I'm posting them here for feedback and anyone looking for a sanity check.

**1 - Increasing 401(k) contributions:** I am tightening other areas of the budget to direct more money into my 401(k) due to the recent dip. I expect that 30 years from now when I can use this money I won’t regret it.

**2 - Continuing scheduled investments:** My wife has a Roth IRA invested in 80% stocks and 20% bonds. we have a home purchase goal for next year invested in 100% bonds. Continuing to fund these regularly as we have.

**3 - Rebalancing accounts:** This is happening automatically, so I’m not actually lifting a finger. But my accounts are being rebalanced which is effectively selling bonds and buying stocks because most of my accounts have drifted from their 80% stock, 20% bond allocation.

**4 - Trying (and mostly failing) to stop watching daily market swings:** It doesn’t serve me at all to watch this stuff so I’m trying to pay less attention to sensationalist headlines on things I can’t control.

**5 - Keeping my home purchase and emergency fund goals conservatively invested:** In tempted to dump these in stocks but recognizing the power of goals based investing. These portfolios have held up well in the volatility, so I’m going to let them keep doing their boring thing.

**What I'm not doing.** As you filter your decisions, think about what I’ve decided not to do as the opposite of the decisions above. Those choices would be:

* Stop contributing a 401(k) or withdraw money. Not happening.
* Cancel scheduled investments. Don’t get spooked, hamburgers are on sale.
* Let accounts drift. Not rebalancing means you end up with style drift.
* Staying glued to the ticker tape. It’s a cruel rollercoaster.
* Putting my emergency fund or home purchase money into stocks to “buy the dip.” That’s short term money and I don’t want to put it at risk.

**4 steps I would take if I could:** These are things I would consider doing but they don't apply because I've already done them (option 1), I don't have the ability to (option 2/3) or don't need to (option 4).

1. **Convert traditional IRAs to Roth.** It could be a solid time for a Roth conversion, paying taxes on money held in a traditional IRA now to never pay taxes on it again. If you have one this could be a good reason because 1) you won’t pay taxes on this transaction for 13 months, 2) it’s likely your account value dropped, 3) there may be additional tax relief next year depending on stimulus measures.
2. **Tax-loss harvest.** I don’t have many opportunities to do this with my portfolio primarily in retirement accounts. But this can be a powerful choice if you suddenly find yourself with losses.
3. **Dollar cost average in a large cash position.** I don’t have much dry powder, but if I did now is a time I would be aggressively averaging into stock indexes over the next few months as this plays out.
4. **Switch investment managers.** Not happy with your investment manager? It may be less expensive to switch to new management if you now have less in taxes to worry about. It’s important to leave for the right reasons, “I lost money” is probably not a good one because that’s the same story every long-term investor is dealing with right now. But if you’re paying high fees, don’t trust your investment manager, or want to move from self management to a fee only financial advisor, this could be a good time.",financialindependence
728,Crossed $250k net worth at 29 years old,,1074,67ki3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/67ki3c/crossed_250k_net_worth_at_29_years_old/,1493164572.0,"I just turned 29 recently and crossed the $250k net worth mark today. I like reading stories like this, so I thought I would share mine. 

**2009** - Net worth was negative $30k since I footed a majority of the bill for my undergrad. At 21, graduated and got my first job in the Northeast making $49k salary (accountant). Lived at home for a year, rent-free thanks to my parents, and paid down some student loans. Took on an additional $10k in debt to finance my masters program, which I completed while working full-time.

**2010 to 2013** - Did not track my net worth. Lived like a typical early 20-something bachelor with expensive bar nights every Friday and Saturday, casino trips with the boys, bought a car for $17.5k and financed it. Changed companies once, which led to small increase in pay, but had more future earning potential. Salary increased to ~$70k. Continued to pay off car and student loans, more than minimum but nothing too crazy. Started with about 6% contribution to my 401k and moved that up to around 10% by the end of 2013.

**2014** – Moved to Manhattan. Sold the car. Everyone told me I’d go broke living in Manhattan. I did not understand how this made sense. No one I knew owned a car and they all had roommates. There was cheap activities all over the place. I didn’t want to be one of those people who moved to Manhattan and saved nothing, so I got on the internet and started researching personal finance and investing, and stumbled upon the FIRE community. 

Became enamored with the FIRE concepts. Canceled all my subscription services. Reduced the amount I went to bars and ate out. Cooked at home more. Stopped buying unnecessary clothes. Continued kicking ass at work to ensure promotion and raises/bonuses came.

Started tracking my net worth which was around $70k by the end of 2014. Mostly 401k, savings account, and some individual stocks minus student loans. Salary at end of year was ~$88k due to raises for move and change in role.

**2015** - Crossed the $100k net worth mark in July of 2015. Was super proud. Still had about $8k of student loans left. Cash compensation crossed the $100k mark with a promotion. Still not tracking my expenses since I figure I’m decently frugal. Definitely struggled a little bit personally with hanging out less with my NYC friends as they were big bar/club goers. Got into reading more and finding cheaper hobbies. First year maxing out 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA. Finally started selling my individual stocks and got into index investing. Vanguard and I started our exclusive relationship. Net worth ends 2015 at $120k.

**2016** - Big year for me. Paid off student loans. Moved to the Midwest while keeping my salary. Started tracking my expenses. Net worth crossed $200k and ended at $210k for the year. Kicked butt at work and was recognized for it - cash compensation totaled $135k. Expenses were just over $26k for the year.

**2017 (so far)** - Crossed the [$250k net worth mark](http://imgur.com/a/6RtB1). Got engaged to someone who understands FIRE and is maxing out their 401k and Roth IRA (I’m so proud). Expect compensation to be the same as 2016. Hoping to end 2017 with a net worth of just over $300k. 

Constantly I feel like this is taking for ever, but then I remind myself to enjoy the NOW. Therefore I try to have fun times with the fiancee, friends, and family. I read, ride my bike, lift weights, go on walks, travel, etc. No point in sitting at the computer stressing out about how long this takes.

I hope you enjoyed my brief story. Feel free to ask questions or give advice. Thanks for your help along the journey so far!",financialindependence
729,five months into early retirement,,1075,7a3m3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7a3m3z/five_months_into_early_retirement/,1509543551.0,"**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing early-retirement series that will continue indefinitely, provided that the voting reflects the view that it is still seen as relevant to the community. I suppose this is my way of giving back to a movement that helped me tremendously on my journey. A background summary is offered in the final section and repeated every month. Please check there to find answers to potential questions.

**Goal**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772 with a SWR of no more than 3% (approximately $30,773 per year in 2017 dollars).

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month were $3155 (including $500 from the lump expenses category), which was $591 over the 2017 monthly targeted amount of $2564 and up from $2491 the previous month. We are 23% over budget for the month, now 7.5% over for the year. We generated $870 from my wife's part-time job at the library (which she would enjoy enough to do without pay) and some of my old book royalties (google if interested). Our investment withdrawal was $2285 this month, thus our pro-rated SWR is 2.57% for the month and 1.89% for the year. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated SWR would have been 3.69% for the month and 3.23% for the year.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,062,468 to $1,082,406 (a 1.88% increase for the month), which dropped down to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,080,121 after paying the bills (a 5.3% increase from the retirement figure of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals for living expenses). Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $65.96/hr of labor income. VTSAX (60%) is up 1.7% this month; VFWAX (21%) is up 2.0%; VWLUX (19%) did what it was supposed to do.

**Reflections**: Our investments are once again at an all-time high. I formerly believed that the election results were driving hopes of deregulation and tax reform. While true to some extent, I now believe that the election results have primarily solidified the notion that the average citizen is too misinformed, gullible, and exploitable to ever vote in his best interest. Spending was considerably up this month for no good reason. We’ve been eating out a lot, but it’s been covered by my wife’s work. We had to pull $500 from the lump sum category for new tires. I continue to question my allocation. I continue to ask myself if I should move away from what I perceive to be an overpriced domestic market and more toward the international funds. I have realized that when the market goes up, I worry that a crash becomes closer to eminent; and when the market goes down, I worry that a crash is starting to happen. The data are there; the math is there; the reasoning is solid; the emotions are getting in the way.

**Experiences**: My half marathon didn’t go quite as planned. I wanted a 1:26, but it was 65F and humid, and I ended up with a 1:28:48. That’s about a 1:26:30 on a good day, but I really needed a 1:26 to feel good about my chances for 3:00 in a full marathon this December. I played my first and probably only round of golf. We won’t talk about my score. I’m still a volunteer tour guide and paleontologist assistance at The Middle Tennessee Natural History Museum. I’ve been running more (almost 50mpw), cooking more, reading more, and going to the movies by myself. I’m still having nightmares about once per month that I’m back at work arguing with morons. My town avoided and survived the planned WLM demonstration. I built an 8x8 cabin in our woods yesterday.

**Plans**: I’m near the peak of my marathon training. I’ll be planting some tress later in the month. The museum director is going to let me put together an astronomy display. I want to get around to some of the PS1 games that I’ve yet to start. I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

**Background**: I am former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors and doctorate before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years. $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k).  I retired on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed.

We live in LCOL rural TN. Our annual expenses should be covered by a 3% SWR ($30,773). The exact starting value of the portfolio was $1,025,772 with the following asset allocation: 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds that will I convert to VBTLX, total US bond market, at the next harvest). We also hold roughly $400k in house/land/belongings not included in the portfolio. This works out to withdrawals of $2564/month, or $2064/month plus $6000 yearly in lump expenses that make monthly totals too volatile (e.g. vacation, property tax, professional license tax, xmas shopping, car insurance, small emergency buffer).

I am considering a retroactive switch to a target of $2500/month ($2000/month + $6000/year lump expenses) and viewing the starting balance over $1M as a separate fund to be drawn from without guilt (with the discipline and understanding that once it’s gone, it’s gone). I place no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (even with no heirs), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities.

If the 2017 year-end value is higher than the starting value, I might recalculate a new 3% SWR value and go forward from there since 3% is well within historically safe territory for indefinite portfolio survival. If you think this strategy violates Trinity, keep thinking until you see how the 3% starting point should tell you otherwise. I might use instead (and keep using each year) the $1M surplus separate fund technique that I described earlier, until the first bad year hits or until $30k/yr is no longer a viable spending goal due to inflation (lifestyle or purchasing power).

I am bored to tears with discussions on safe SWR, COL, UBI, ACA subsidy ethics, Trinity, insurance, health care costs, what-if scenarios, financial doomsday preppers, crystal balls, investment strategies, side hustles, lifestyle inflation, market corrections, frugality tips, tax avoidance, my former life as a pharmacist, and even the acronym FIRE. When you’re new to the topic of early retirement, all of that stuff is very exciting. When you’ve run the race and crossed the line, not so much. This is a public forum, and I’ll likely read what you have to say, but please don’t expect much in the way of a response if it’s a question that I or someone else has answered a million times, especially if you’re just offering an unsubstantiated claim about my personal situation that demonstrates willful stupidity. It happens every month. I am however willing to clarify anything and discuss topics I find to be of more interest. I genuinely appreciate all the congratulations and well-wishers.

I'm getting ready to purchase a home again and started using the New York Times Rent Vs Buy calculator fairly frequently. I find that calculator to be quite useful.

A few years ago I dug into the calculations used by the NY Times calculator, and created a spreadsheet that provides the same calculations. I have now cleaned that spreadsheet up, and posting it for others who may find it useful.

[Rent Vs Buy Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEas86QEB5xNc-a7xHxQI5h2WH8jDDO_EINj7z_LBNQ/edit?usp=sharing) (Remember to download the spreadsheet so you can change the input values for your situation).

For those familiar with the online calculator, the spreadsheet version lets you put in rent values directly, instead of having the break-even rent displayed based on the housing costs.

Maintenance costs has been split into Maintenance and Renovation costs.

The online calculator has a hard-coded 15% capital gains rate - the spreadsheet version lets that be modified.

Please provide feedback if you have any.

733,Suggestions from a long-time FIREee on coping with anxiety.,,1068,fnl5fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fnl5fy/suggestions_from_a_longtime_fireee_on_coping_with/,1584974897.0,"Speaking as a guy who ER'd in 2005 and who got through the housing bubble, anxiety is totally natural and OK. I imagine you've heard what I'm about to say, but hopefully it'll encourage you to hear that these coping mechanisms aren't just theoretical, but are actually effective. They're working for me right this very second.

**STOP ENDLESSLY BROWSING REDDIT AND OTHER FORMS OF ANONYMOUS SOCIAL MEDIA.** This is huge. For human interaction switch largely over to what let's call intentional conversation. Communicate with friends and family and acquaintances directly by phone or IM or whatever best suits you instead of getting lost in a crowd of strangers. Target your support. This brings out the best in people.

**Stick to hard news and stay away from sensationalized coverage.** Despite what I just said about Reddit, /r/covid19 is a great central source for hard science. The science is encouraging, and it's great to see how the global scientific community is coming together.

**Find stories about everyday heroes, like the teacher who's right now leading my daughter's virtual classroom.** In 2009 we were all uplifted when Captain Sully safely landed that American Airlines flight in the Hudson River. Stories like that were what we needed to hear. Honest to God, I'm pretty much worshiping the linoleum my pharmacist walks on.

**Futurology doesn't have to be negative.** Like: the distributed manufacturing systems springing up are gonna be huge in the post-COVID-19 world. I seriously wish I owned a 3D printer right now. This event could also blow a lot of bullshit out of our healthcare and college systems. Etc., etc.

**Keep exercising.** No need to belabor this. Yoga and burpees if nothing else.

**Establish a routine.** Old convicts frequently tell new ones how important it is to structure their day instead of sitting around playing cards and doing constructive things only when they feel like it. This is good advice for anybody. Keeps one busy instead of sitting around mooning about stuff or smoking weed all day or spanking the monkey fourteen times an hour. It takes some self-discipline, but it's totally worth it. Incorporate an educational component. ""I like birds, so today I'm gonna replace a half-hour of Netflix with a half-hour ornithology lecture.""

**Remember that as a FIREee or an aspiring one, you're already ahead of the game because you have some money put by.** Our community's gonna hear a lot of ""Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were, eh?"" Whatever. We were at least smart enough to make money and keep it and put it to work for us. A direct reason I was able to FIRE is that my grandparents survived the Great Depression and passed what they learned to my parents and to me. This is a hell of an opportunity for us to be ambassadors for sound personal financial management.

**Figure out ways to spend locally.** There are gonna be a lot of cottage industries springing up. My wife and I have more or less pledged to each other that if it should work out that we get stimulus checks, we're gonna spend them on our friends who are trying to earn money. Like: my friend forages for wild mushrooms and such for selling to restaurants. That market has dried up. We just started buying watercress from him. Everybody wins.

**Check out live-streaming performances.** Did you catch the Dropkick Murphys live show last week? I was like, damn, this is exactly the breath of encouragement and normalcy I needed. /r/festivals is doing some great work curating this stuff. My wife's over here watching a video Steve Martin just posted. He's out in the woods somewhere playing the banjo. It's awesome.

I guess that's it for the moment. Last thing I'll say is that while I don't know you personally, I care about you and I want you to feel healthy and happy. Stay strong and be well.

Edit: typos and shit.

Edit edit: I note with some amusement that people aren't finding the notion of spanking the monkey fourteen times an hour to be implausible enough to comment on. Maybe that's just a Reddit thing. Hmm.",financialindependence

FIRE was such a life changing idea and yet so simple - 'what can I buy with this extra money? - get rid of your job dummy, so you can free up your time/live your life!' that I am surprised I had to have this told to me by someone rather than have it be self evident.

My question is:
What are some other 'blow your mind' approaches/mindsets/ways of thinking in life-design/health/relationships/finance/problem solving/stress management/time management/learning how to learn/limiting beliefs/risk taking/maximising your potential  ..or anything else really..) that have completely changed your life in a big way?

An analogy I read elsewhere on reddit : you can spend hours fumbling around for the light switch in a dark room - but once someone who knows where it is flips the light switch on for you - its very obvious where it is. I'm hoping folks in this community flip some other 'light switches' on for me and others here.

Both in our early 30's. We had a combined income of $220k and saved 50%.  Over the years, we've saved about $900k that are mostly in Vanguard mutual funds.  Our goal is $2 million with a 5% withdrawal rate.

We lived very close to work, but in an undesirable area.  Because of that, we owned a second home about 2.5 hours away that we would go to most weekends and holidays.  This second home is much closer to friends and family.  This is where we planned on retiring to once we hit our magic number.

Our company started offering remote work to some employees who were in certain positions.  Unfortunately, nether of our positions were available.  We spoke to our managers and we were both offered remote work by moving into different positions within the company.  Our combined income would drop $50k, bringing us down to $170k.

Well, we pulled the trigger.  We sold our primary home (walked away with $62k at settlement), and moved into our second home, where we now both work remotely.  Our expenditures dropped almost $2000/mo (no more mortgage, insurance, property taxes, utilities, and weekly gas driving back and forth to our second house).  We also cut back on eating out for dinner (which we were doing a lot on weekends while at the second house).  We cook at home much more now.

Our income obviously dropped more than our expenditures, but our quality of life is so much better.  On top of all that, we had our first child.  Because we both work from home, we have no day care expenses, which we would have had if we both still worked in the office.

Were we stupid for giving up that much income to simplify our lives?  I don't want to really do the math to see how many years it will set us back.  But it's been about 6 months and we have no regrets.  Life is good, and we're still on the road toward financial independence.   I just wanted to share our story.  Thanks for reading.

Honestly, I don't really have anything concrete to show for the past year other than being happier and more optimistic about my life. But that's gotta count for something, right?

#Backstory

To set the scene, when I first found this subreddit, I was working a boring meaningless job where I would go multiple days with nothing to do, including when I asked people if they needed help. I couldn't even watch movies most of the time because too many people walked around my desk. It was like being trapped in Office Space as some mix of Michael and Milton. My work history to that point was basically *chase dream -> face reality -> chase dream -> face reality*. I've still never had a single job for more than a year and a half. The highest salary I ever had was $50k (for three months!). The ""dream"" jobs never paid well, and of course were never what I dreamed they would be. 

I found FIRE and got completely into it. I tend to get obsessive when I'm excited about something, and early retirement is obviously very exciting to a dream chaser like me. Combined with being in a long distance relationship, my life became about FIRE and exercise and not much else. I almost never went out or socialized and I learned a lot about both topics. Shockingly, I wasn't very happy! All I could think about was how long it would be until I reached my number, and how much switching to an all-Soylent diet would reduce the time to FI. (Almost none, don't drink that shit). 

At some point, I learned that US citizens can get Working Holiday visas that allow them to travel to another country and legally work there for one year. You're eligible for the visa until you're 30, and I was 28 and a half, so it seemed like now-or-never. I chose New Zealand based on zero research and the fact that it was basically the farthest I could go. Did you know Auckland is one of the 20 most expensive cities in the world and has a housing bubble rivaling NYC? I sure didn't!

Regardless of my lack of research, I decided to put all that FIRE energy and knowledge into this crazy plan and immediately got excited and happy again. Here's the first big thing about doing this: You have a new exciting project to work towards, and it's a great distraction from whatever you hate about work, so it feels like a great idea. You also get to throw going away parties and tell everyone you talk to that you're moving to New Zealand like you're Fred Armisen in that Portlandia sketch I can't find. Suddenly you're That Guy! You'll love this part. 

The big day comes, and you take a crazy trip and see Hawaii and spend a week on the beach and it rules, and maybe you'll become a travel blogger or Insta star or something because day jobs are for suckers. I thought about it for a bit and remembered I hate social media and travel blogging is a weird world I have no interest in learning about. But whatever, still on the beach.

You get to your new city and find a place to live and you learn that Auckland, as a city, only discovered home insulation about six months ago, and [winter is coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). But whatever, it's colder where you're from, and you're going to be too busy having adventures. Although you need a car because public transit is expensive and slow here, and it doesn't go to any of the beaches you want to visit. 

A month or two goes by and it's time to get a job. You've had some adventures, but not as many as you planned because you spent more time than expected apartment hunting, or finding a car, or figuring out where the hell to buy groceries that wasn't a ripoff. That's fine though, this is all part of the plan. You find a job and it pays less than you expected because not many people here use Glassdoor, and the answers you got on reddit weren't as informative as you thought, or you just asked the wrong questions. Still, it pays enough to cover your expenses and then some. A month in, you realize the job isn't really what they described. Or you constantly get pressured into overtime. Or your boss sucks. Whatever the reason, you hate this job. Maybe you get another one, maybe you talk to people who tell you your situation is actually extremely common here. 

And then, [you finally realize what everyone said was true.](https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21515)

#Lessons and stuff

The story can end here and I can be like ""BEWARE TRAVELER! ALL IS NOT AS IT SEEMS!"" Or in reddit parlance, ""This won't make you happy, just stick to the 4% rule!"". Sadly, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to end the story with. I've seen some cool stuff here, but nothing as awe-inspiring as the Grand Canyon. I have more interesting stories to tell at parties, but I'm not inherently any more interesting as a person. Most of the personal growth I've had since moving here, I could've gotten by just moving to a new apartment in another city back home, and I'd have way more money to show for it. 

I've been here nearly a year now, and I have about as much money as I had before (on track to retire at 70). I decided to do another visa as I'm 30 now so it's my actual last chance, and Australia is right next door. I'm told the pay is dramatically better there, so I hope to strike a balance between more ""adventures"" and shoring up my savings to slightly higher than where they were when I left the US. 

I said I was happy and optimistic now, and I am. I didn't have any book-worthy adventures, and when people say ""woah you live in New Zealand!"" I tell them it's not really as big a deal as they think. After all, I see more expats than Kiwis most days. But really, there's a lot to be said for taking a huge risk regardless of if it pays off. I went through that cycle of chasing dreams and then getting a day job because it felt like I had to, either because of debt or FIRE aspirations. I never committed to either plan. Moving here wasn't important because it was another country, or because there were adventures to be had, *it was just the act of committing fully to a plan without being able to back out*. There's a big difference between keeping a job you hate because you feel like quitting would delay FIRE, vs *applying* for a job you you *know* you'll hate because you're so committed to FIRE that you decided this sacrifice would be worth it. There's a difference between becoming a programmer because it pays well and becoming a programmer because you love programming.

Personally, I'm hoping to find a job I really enjoy, possibly some kind of remote work or starting a business. But I know I'll probably have to go back to a day job I'll hate at some point. This time though, I'll have a clearer reason for doing it, which makes all the difference. The reason I'm still optimistic is because I'm a stubborn idiot who had to get a shitty job in another country to finally internalize all the advice I already knew. Maybe the same is the case for you and you won't be happy until you give it a shot, or maybe just reading this story was enough. I'm not worried about FIRE because there are plenty of stories of people who pulled their shit together much older than me. Before, I was just chasing FIRE to escape my situation... which I was in because I was worried about FIRE. 

#TL;DR

I said there was no one-size-fits-all advice, but here are some bullet points in place of a TL;DR because it's 2:30am here and I can't believe how much personal information I wrote, and the writing gets pretty sloppy toward the end and I think I missed the original point I was trying to make when I started? So I feel like I owe you something.

**EDIT:** Answering comments made me realize what I missed - I didn't make it clear that I haven't *abandoned* FIRE, I'm just putting all the lessons about saving and living below your means toward other goals for a while. I definitely will keep FIRE in mind when I get resettled and have a more permanent job again, but it'll be with a different perspective.  Also added headings for /u/Oax_Mike

* Every job sucks, but some suck less. If you're just doing it for FIRE, consider why FIRE is that important to you. Would you delay retirement by one year to be 20% happier for ten years?
* Working a job you hate is much easier when you're doing it for a specific reason, but FIRE a decade from now isn't as motivating as some other plan that's only a year away. Mixing in short-term goals/rewards (aside from just seeing a certain number on your spreadsheet) might push back your date slightly, but it might save you a lot of money on therapy.
* Having more cash [makes people happier](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/52k32k/wsj_the_more_cash_people_have_the_happier_they_are/) than [having more net worth](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=217683). Holding more cash might delay your FIRE by a few months, but it might be worth it to have a tangible reminder of how well you're doing.
* Slow and steady wins the race, but FIRE is like trying to be the tortoise and the hare at the same time. How far ahead do you need to be before you decide it's okay to slow to a jog?
* Moving to a new country is filled with exactly as many unforeseen problems as everyone will tell you.
* Don't half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.
* Don't write treatises at ~~2:30am~~ ~~3:00am~~ 3:30am 

I couldn't decide if this should be an AMA or a standalone post, so I might as well do both. If you have any questions about my (hopefully coherent) story, or if you hate you're job and you've been thinking about running away, feel free to ask me anything. There may be an 8 hour delay in answers if I finally pass out.",financialindependence

Hi! I’m a ***27F*** CPA living in Toronto, Canada\*\*\*. I wanted to post this to show the non IT people in this sub that there are other careers where it’s possible to increase net worth quickly despite not making 100k right out of school\*\*\*. I’ve always been a saver but I discovered MMM in December 2015 (when I was 24). The realization I could retire at 35 really lit a fire under my ass to save even more and actually invest it. I was working through my CPA at a big 4 accounting firm at the time and hated every second of it. To be honest, accounting is boring and a ‘meh’ career at best, but the money is good so I will most likely stay on this path until I feel FI enough, if not actual FIRE.

I live in the ~~downtown core of the~~ most if not second most expensive city in Canada, sharing a ***small home*** ~~two bedroom condo apartment~~ ***with my SO that we recently purchased***. I have no expensive hobbies other than travel and lead a pretty ‘boring’ life. I’m slowly getting healthier and into exercising but those things are harder for me than saving money.

The privilege – My parents paid for 3 out of my 4 years of university. That’s about 36k that I got for free which will never have to be repaid (I asked). That one year and for the 2 years I lived on campus I paid for myself through part time jobs before and during university. I also went back to live with my parents for one year rent free during my 6 years of working, which was a nice boost to my net worth during that time.

Here are the numbers!

&#x200B;

**The goals**

My spending goal in retirement for one person is $20,000-$30,000 per year (as part of a $40,000-$60,000 spend household). I expect my SO to pay their own way on this FIRE journey. The dream at the moment looks like one year on one year off long term slow travel, most likely for 5ish years of travel. On the off years, we could work, volunteer, whatever. These FIRE plans are not that defined because who knows what I’ll feel like in 5-10 years.

All else being equal (is it ever?) I expect to achieve the following net worth milestones at the following ages:

**Annual Spend (individual)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|**Annual Spend (individual)**|**$20,000.00**||**$25,000.00**||**$30,000.00**||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FI @ 4%|$500,000.00|29|$625,000.00|30|$750,000.00|33|
|FI @ 3.5%|$571,428.57|30|$714,285.71|31|$857,142.86|34|
|FI @ 3.25%|$615,384.62|30|$769,230.77|32|$923,076.92|35|
|FI @ 3%|$666,666.67|31|$833,333.33|32|$1,000,000.00|35|

\^the above does not account for market corrections/recessions. If one happens tomorrow obviously those ages will change.

My flair is based on the first goal - $500k for 20k of spending at 4%. Is that going to be the number I FIRE at? Probably not, given the expectation of a low growth environment in the near future and my young age at the expected time. But it’s a number that I would feel comfortable about enough to shift into something more chill. It’s possible and even likely that I’ll experience the golden handcuffs phenom and stay for a while past that though to feather the nest and add security.

Future plan/goals – I have no interest in having children, which enables my fast FIRE journey and long term travel plans. I am also lukewarm towards real estate because of the very high property prices in Toronto as compared to rents, and my distaste at paying maintenance fees on condos .AKA if I buy; it has to be a freehold house, which makes homeownership an even more expensive proposition. While Canada is great, it’s also possible that I will be OK with living somewhere else with single payer health care long term (I hate winter), so that’s another reason buying is not high on the priority list. ***So we did buy a house… but it’s a freehold! With a basement tenant unit!***

&#x200B;

**Income history and Net Worth**

I started my career at a big 4 accounting firm making 45k, then 50k the next year, then 60k the next. These are standard salaries for this job in my city – Toronto. During this time I was renting a place downtown with a roommate or SO.

After leaving the firm my first job out was at 75k, and I moved to live with my parents for that year. Getting rid of rent was amazing for my net worth. Then I moved to a more interesting job that I thought I would love for 80k and started paying rent again. Now I’m still paying rent, but making 95k somewhere else\*\*\*. Now I’m paying for half a mortgage.\*\*\*

I do have access to a side hustle that I started participating in around 2016. It’s very CPA specific and involves helping incoming CPAs get feedback for their practice exams in preparation for the qualification exams we have to write in this profession. I think I made <$2000 the first year I did it, but it grew steadily and I made $***20,600*** last year from this.

My net worth started at -$10,000 on the day I graduated university in the summer of 2013. That debt was owed to my parents for a lavish long trip I took that summer which I repaid in my first year of working. No regrets. After I started working and saving, it began steadily going up. My records are spotty in the beginning, since I was just saving to save.

I reached the 200k milestone sometime in April 2018 at 26 years old, 1 year and 5 months after 100k (4 years, 7 months after my first day of work). It definitely gets faster (especially if you have year of not paying rent!).

All else equal and barring a downturn, I hope to achieve the 300k milestone around winter 2019. Depending on the side hustle this year and with my increased income, here’s hoping for Dec 2018 instead of March 2019. ***Well that didn’t work out, but that was mainly because of saving up for the house during the low market in the 2018 winter and the closing costs.***

***Why the big jumps toward the end there? Bonuses and side hustle money coming through (it comes in large chunks) and the tenant providing first and last helped as well.***

***The 300k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2019, one year after 200k (5 years, 7 months after my first day of work). It’s definitely getting easier and easier to amass more money as my income grows and the growth compounds due to the nest egg size.***

***I’m hoping 400k comes around the same time next year. Side hustle should be around the same this year but we’re planning a lavish vacation and some minor renovations.***

&#x200B;

**Monthly expenses**

***This was a major point of contention last time I posted. No one believes I spend so little money but it is what it is folks. I’ve provided more detail this time since 2018 just wrapped up.***

For a millennial living in a huge high COL city, I don’t spend a lot of money. This has enabled me to save a ton of money even on my previously medium salaries.

***Please keep in mind that these expenses are for myself only. My SO and I split household expenses and spend our own money on items like clothes or video games. I don’t foresee our essentials spending increasing above what it currently is and the tenant is very helpful in reducing those costs to a level where it is cheaper to live in the house than our previous condo rental without taking into account future selling prices, etc. We did consult a rent vs buy calculator before purchasing and the house was still in the buy zone which is rare for Toronto. I foresee us staying here for around 5 years before flipping into a newer home and/or retiring to travel for a while depending on the circumstances.***

**Investments**

My tax advantaged accounts are maxed out and self-managed through a DIY brokerage. My taxable contributions are split evenly between the same self-managed DIY brokerage and a robo advisor for shits and giggles. The robo advisor is winning at the moment, because I view my DIY brokerage holdings as a whole unit so my taxable account gets the brunt of the bonds (low rate environment). ***Now my net worth also includes my half of the home equity and some work provided RRSP (Canada's 401k) accounts.***

&#x200B;

The DIY Portfolio is as follows:

***Cash: 6.6% (preference is 0%),***  ***should be way lower but I just haven’t had the time to invest it due to work being busy.***

&#x200B;

***Bonds: 11.3% (preference is 5%), ZAG mostly. I’m meh about this allocation and am slowly reducing it through buying other things. This probably won’t go down noticeably unless we hit a recession and I rebalance.***

&#x200B;

***REITs: 3.4% (preference is 2.5%), VRE mostly. Also meh about this allocation. This will go the way of the bonds when I need to rebalance if the market makes moves. Since I own a home now this is not required.***

&#x200B;

***Canadian dividend stocks: 5.8% (preference is 2%, my investing strategy used to be dividend based so this is a remaining position from then), CDZ.***

&#x200B;

***Canadian Market: 2.4% (preference is 2.5%),VCN***

&#x200B;

***US Market – hedged to CAD: 20.6% (preference is 25.5%),VUS/VSP***

&#x200B;

***US Market – unhedged: 21% (preference is 25.5%), VUN/VTI(n USD)***

&#x200B;

***International (both developed and developing) – unhedged: 28.7% (preference is 36.5%) XEF+XEC/VXUS(in USD)***

&#x200B;

My robo advisor has split my investments as follows:

Bonds: $20%

Low carbon global stocks: 27%

Canadian stocks: 23%

Global stocks: 15%

Cleantech stocks: 15%

&#x200B;

I’d love any advice on my allocations. I rebalance when I invest so it’s a bit slow.

&#x200B;

Is there anything else you want to know?

&#x200B;

If this post is well received and the community feels it’s useful, I’ll make another one when I get to $400k.

She is 25 and I just turned 24. We share all income and I manage the money. Not sure if anyone cares but I enjoy reading stories of people's success on this sub.

&#x200B;

I grew up saving all my money and was very frugal. I saved money since I was 7 years old in hopes that I would use it to buy a car when I was age 16. Throughout my life I practice delayed gratification with all purchases and rarely buy something that is not of use. I always look out for sales and don't try to satisfy myself with dumb purchases. I am seen by all my friends as cheap and frugal, which I don't mind considering I don't have much financial stress. I have never in my life had an expense I haven't been able to comfortably afford. My parents taught me the value of money early on. I have always purchased my own phone, cell service, car, repairs, insurance, school. etc. since I was a kid. My parents are great people and I don't regret them not buying me cars or helping with gas money. They could have easily helped at times, but I wouldn't have learned the same lessons. 

&#x200B;

Throughout highschool I worked all summer long full time and other part time jobs during the school year. During college I got good grades and stayed home. Scholorships paid for every dime and I was able to work 2-3 jobs at a time during college. My wife went away and school was paid due to her parent's benefits from work. The day before my 22nd birthday I moved out of my parents house with my fiance, now wife, and we both started new careers in a new town. I made 40k a year with no benefits or time off and she made 30k with no benefits or time off. We got married 2 months after moving out and luckily did not have to pay much at all for our wedding, thanks to our parents. After the wedding we had approximately 15k-20k to our names. My wife now makes 40k a year with bad benefits and time off. I got a new job exactly 1 year ago, 1.25 years after moving out, and started making 65k a year. After 6 months I got bumped up to 78k and now I am at 83k. This does not include overtime, which I make approximately 10k from. I have great benefits and time off with my job. I am set to make 105k guaranteed in 3 years. The job has a pension, which I contribute and count towards my net worth considering I am not vested yet. After 30 years I can recieve 75% of my top pay. After the 105k guarantee I am set for 2.5% incrament raised yearly. 

&#x200B;

Currently we are saving for a down payment on a house worth 250-275k. My wife is going back to school which will be an extra expense over the course of approximately 4 years. During this time it will be harder to save due to her needing to take a less active position and work an hourly job. It will help when she finishes school and can get a higher paid position with good retirement and benefits. In 6 months my job will be very much secure, and that is when we will purchase a house. 

&#x200B;

Within 2.5 years our combined net worth has gone from 10k to 100k. I have been using YNAB during this time which is awesome for me. I track every penny we spend and can save for certain categories. This allows me to spend money on things I want, which I hate spending money, without having the regret.

744,My wife would like to retire,,1055,ch8avf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ch8avf/my_wife_would_like_to_retire/,1563975517.0,"We're in our forties, $1.1M saved, targeting about $2.5M to retire.  If we make no change we can save and invest about $100K each year.  If she retires now, it would be more like $50K.  Assuming 6% return, we would reach the goal in 2026 or 2029 respectively.  I like my job quite a bit, she does not like hers.  

**Retirement Pros:**  
* About 6 fewer years worked for her, 3 fewer years combined, and all the freedom that comes with that   
* Less stress (her job is annoying with a long commute and cruddy boss)  
* Better fitness as she has a hard time exercising as much as she'd like with current schedule/responsibilities  
* I have somewhat flexible work hours and tons of unused vacation so we could sometimes enjoy things together during the work day  
* She can help me tackle the stuff on our to-do list that would help out family but is hard to find time for now, for example selling some of our stuff that is cluttering up the house, cooking new recipes, or working with the kids on a chore schedule  

**Cons:**  
* I will need to work about 3 extra years  
* If something bad happens like an illness or a layoff, we have less safety net.  I was laid off two years ago and was fortunate to find another role in the same organization before I was unemployed, but the thought is still looming  
* Her not working could change our relationship dynamics for the worse.  For example, she may have lower self worth because she's not contributing financially.  Or, she might find the family work to be unrewarding and/or more annoying than her current job.  Or I might feel some resentment if I feel like she's not ""pulling her weight"". I don't expect any of those things to happen, but it's hard to know for sure until you're in it.

We've talked about all of this some already, but I'd love to hear any other opinions on the situation, thanks.",financialindependence

I grew up in a low-income household in the south. I spent a few years in a single parent home. I remember sharing a bunk bed with my younger sibling in a 700 sq foot apartment. I remember constantly worrying about money.

I still worry about money. A recent post talked about anxiety with money, and it described me perfectly. I still look at prices before ordering food at a restaurant. I still work multiple jobs to increase my income. Although I struggle with anxiety, I hope my story can provide some inspiration.

I read my first personal finance book at age 10, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I knew two things: I was poor and didn't want to stay that way.

I married my wife several years ago right out of college. I attended college at a location where I could graduate with minimal debt. We graduated with about 20K in student loans. We lived with my parents and paid off our loans in a few months. In 2013, we were making 75K combined between both of us. We bought a conservative house based on our income (Cost of 189K). One of my only regrets is not buying a bigger house in 2013. (I was convinced we were about to have another recession.)

In the past five years, I went from a -20K net worth to 200K. We had two kids during this time, and my wife stays home with our children now. I know most posts on this sub display the extremes of people trying to reach FI ASAP. I know having children early in life is not an ideal financial decision. I know I am losing income by having my wife stay home. However, I still built a sizeable war chest with these factors.

My current net worth is 160K in investments and 40K of home equity. I only have 50K in my 401(k), the rest are in a brokerage account or in Roth IRA's. I know this is not the typical path, but I think most people of the FI community focus too much on ""saving money on taxes."" My effective tax rate was below 10% for most of my career so far. I'd rather have 90K of money I'd already paid taxes on than 100K of money in a 401(k).

I have been promoted multiple times at work. I work for a large company with great potential. I also live in a LCOL area with a 20 minute commute. I work as a freelancer on the side in addition to my day job. Since 2013, I have increased my income from 40K to 95K. I am in line to get another promotion in the next year or so which will increase my income to 110K. I do not plan to enhance my lifestyle once I get another promotion. Working at a growing company is an excellent way to boost a career. Much easier to get promoted when your company is making money.

My plan is to quit corporate life once I hit 500K or 600k. My projections currently have this point around the age of 33 - 35 depending on the input rate of return. I want to continue working on my own accord at that point. Maybe some freelancing, maybe some Barista FIRE. I just don't want to sit in a cubicle my whole life.

I know this is not the most exciting story to read, but I am happy to answer any questions. I also know 200K at 27 is not the most impressive number on this sub. However, if I can make it to this point at this age, anybody can with enough forward planning. Happy to answer any questions. I don't live on my phone, so there may be a few hour delay in my responses. ",financialindependence
746,nine months into early retirement,,1048,81335s,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/81335s/nine_months_into_early_retirement/,1519883719.0,"**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing monthly early-retirement series that will continue indefinitely, provided that the voting reflects the view that it is still seen as relevant to the community. I suppose that this is my way of giving back to a movement that helped me tremendously on my journey. As this post has become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend a great deal of the first day of every month on reddit has significantly waned, **my responses might be limited**. Career and background summaries are provided at the end and repeated every month. Please check those sections as well as the comments and posts from previous months to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all the thanks and well-wishers, even if I don’t take the time to say so individually.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My maximum withdrawal rate is 3% of each year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month ($30k per year) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3% withdrawal rate is below the 100% historically safe mark of 3.2% for fifty-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20% above the original target amount (meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5% instead of 3% if restarting from the peak); and our actual withdrawal rate has averaged less than 2% of the original portfolio balance thus far due to earning additional income. The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 ($2618 adjusted for inflation).

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month came to $2750. This is $23 under the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 0.8% under budget for the month, 10.1% under for the year, and 12.7% over since retirement. We generated $5140 of income this month from a tax refund, my wife wanting to work, and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was -$2390 this month (a $2390 deposit), thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate is -2.59% for the month, -0.89% for the year, and 1.58% since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 2.98% for the month, 2.70% for the year, and 3.38% since retirement.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,155,635 to $1,114,925 (a 3.52% decrease for the month), which went up to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,117,315 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is an 8.9% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals of $12,349 for living expenses over nine months. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $66.60/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $16.98/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $7.92/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate. Ignoring possible dividends, VTSAX (62% AA) went down 3.9% this month (1.3% up for the year); VFWAX (21% AA) went down 5.2% (0.2% up for the year); VWLUX (17% AA) went down 0.8% (down 2.3% for the year).

**Reflections**: Given the wild ride of the market in February, I suspect that many subscribers are curious about my level of investment panic. These are the ten best reasons why I have none: my withdrawal rate thus far has been less than one-half of the 100%-historically-safe fifty-year portfolio survival point (1.58% versus 3.20%); the market showed that I retired well below its maximum appetite when the portfolio increased a further 10% above my goal amount by year-end 2017 (and nearly 20% by the 1/26/2018 peak); portfolio survival is best understood when considering its correlation with CAPE, and nothing has actually changed there (e.g., $1M at peak market value is no more/less historically safe than $900k following a 10% drop); my model still has no reliance upon social security, supplemental income, inheritance, or home equity; I understand the inevitably of corrections and am still light years beyond where I would have been financially if I had listened to any of the dart-throwing monkeys offering their advice over the years on when to jump out; starting a new career at some point seems inevitable considering that I burn through interests, goals, and accomplishments rather quickly; a market downturn due to something like wage inflation is for the overall good of society (and for the good of those new to the financial independence movement); a market downturn would (fairly or not) reflect poorly upon the one person who is already widely regarded by intellectuals as a demagogic moron; my 100-point gratitude list is embarrassingly rich; and I will never regret leaving work since it was for the sake of my physical and mental health, not because I had met my financial goals. Sure, I wish I had temporarily jumped out near the market peak, but I’m also glad I didn’t jump out in 2008/2010/2011/2015 when the monkeys were howling just as loud.

**Experiences**: I posted a 1:25:04 in my half marathon to earn my first age group award and first top 1% finish (4th out of 406). My previous best was 1:27:57. I miscalculated/overestimated the effort necessary to go sub-1:25 upon completing Mile 12, conceding that I could not go uphill at 6:10/mi pace when it was actually 6:25/mi that was needed. It’s easy for me to suggest this now, but I feel that I could have found a way to shave five more seconds. Math is hard when you are deprived of oxygen. I finished watching Game of Thrones, which I placed at #11 on my favorite shows list. I played the rest of the Gamecube games that I never got around to experiencing, including the excellent Tales of Symphonia. The controller however nearly ruins the system. I am now finally caught up for the first time since 2005 on having played every game, listened to every album, and watched every film that I own. My parents recently had their house and farm appraised at $800k (up from $500k five years ago), which is good news when considering potential inheritance. I neatened up the driveway a bit and detoured water flow in our woods so that we have a small creek after a rain instead of having everything continue to run into a growing sinkhole. I spent a whole day hanging out with an old friend, listening to what he thinks are financially responsible plans for a large profit from the sale of his house. My solicited advice was analogous to a horse and water.

**Upcoming**: I have nothing major planned this month because Final Fantasy XV gets a PC release on 3/6. I resisted buying a PS4 to play it for over a year. Training intensity will also peak due to my full marathon taking place on 4/7. It’s the state championship, so we’ll see how that goes. These two events will occupy most of my free time in March. I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70%.

**Background**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

I am 31F working in tech(non-engineer). I am really proud of myself for taking the time to gain invaluable knowledge to grow my net worth to what it is today. I have been able to more than double my net worth in the last 2.5 years, with the help of this sub. 


https://imgur.com/wlrfIxP


In 2019, my total income was over $200k, which I was stunned at, but really shows the power a growth company (non-FAANG) can have on your NW. I have worked for a tech company for 5+ years in a VHCOL city and didn’t always sell my RSUs/ESPP, against conventional wisdom, but it paid off for me last year when the stock took off and was up over 100% YoY at some point. I took advantage of that and sold a lot (but not all) of my stock.


My NW was down about 50-60k during the March 2020 selloff but has more than recovered since then. I have more than recovered from that low, up about 92k from the low. I stuck with the advice that I’ve read on here and didn’t panic sell. I kept my investment allocation to what I was comfortable with(70% stocks/ 30% bonds/cash) and it rode it out. I believe that having some cash available in retirement accounts is good for when the market sells off. I know it’s not the advice always given here but I believe it works for me. I try to keep about 10% minimum of cash in my retirement accounts just in case.


I max out my 401k(19.5k+4.5k match). I stopped contributing to my IRA/Roth IRA a few years ago once I hit the income caps. I currently have about $170k among my 401k/Roth IRA/IRA accounts. I am hesitant to do the mega back-door Roth because I’d have to pay tax on the amount I have in the traditional IRA(~15k) and I feel like my tax rate is high as it is. I know it’s a one time hit but I am saving money for a condo/house instead. I am not in a rush to buy a condo/house right now but continue to save up for one in the near-term(1-3 years probably) which is why I have a lot of cash on hand($100k+). I know it could be invested but in this environment I am too nervous at the potential of losing some of my savings. I also don’t know if I am ready to be a homeowner as the thought stresses me out. I think there are so many things that could go wrong(like repairs) and I don’t know how to really fix anything. Right now, I like the convenience of renting but I know I am not building equity.


I also sometimes wonder whether I am saving too much for retirement but I continue to max out my 401k because I believe it’s the prudent thing to do. I am targeting $2.2-2.4M for retirement with a 4% withdrawal rate. It’s hard for me to estimate my retirement expenses so I think ~$85k/year should be sufficient for now but I don’t know. This is not factoring in any income from a potential partner either.


I have no student loans, my car has been paid off for a couple of years now, and I pay my cc bills in full each month. This gives me flexibility, security, and financial freedom. Arguably, my rent is high (~2900/month) but most of the other spending is discretionary and during quarantine my expenses have come down and my biggest expense is probably groceries and things from Target/Costco(~$300/month). I try not to eat out as much as possible and max spend $100/month but normally closer to $50).


For those of you who are new here or are unsure about getting on board with the advice you’ve read here, I can attest to it and it’s really made a positive change to my life. I feel stable and secure financially, which I have learned is one of my most important values, which puts me at peace. I am thankful. Thank you.",financialindependence
751,Your FIRE obsession may be a symptom of stress,,1045,96jo5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96jo5r/your_fire_obsession_may_be_a_symptom_of_stress/,1534019881.0,"Recently I quit a 140K job in a MCOL area to switch to a 100K role within the same organization. I've had the role I am switching to before and I could not be happier. But quite surprisingly, even within a few days of making this decisions I have noticed a change in my attitude towards FIRE. I am caring less and less about when it will happen. My high base level stress is what was fueling my constant need to plan FIRE even when I wasn't aware that there was anything bothering me. In hindsight, this should be really obvious... when work isn't miserable, dreaming about not doing it is not something we obsessively gravitate towards. But in the midst of it I did not see it so clearly.

The rest of this post is about what I mean by stress since it is a vague concept. In order to make this decision I deliberated for a year over what exactly is it that is making me miserable. I tried anything I could think of to quantify my sources of stress and reduce them as much as possible. For me, stress came from the following elements:

*  Complexity of work: This is by far the biggest factor. The more complex the work, the more anxiety inducing it becomes and the more effort it takes to make any progress. Regardless of any other variables, a complex enough job can substantially reduce my QOL. There was no getting around that in my role.
* Quantity of work: There is a certain threshold of work, mental and physical, above which it starts to take a toll on us. If that threshold is being consistently crossed, it can generate a lot of stress and unhappiness.
* Urgency of work: While urgency can be a powerful tool for productivity, it also generates it's own form of stress. Consistent exposure to it will generate similar effects as too much quantity.
* Alignment with personal goals: A job that feels like it is contributing towards what you want to learn and accomplish in life, suddenly becomes a lot more bearable. That's how professors can get students to do the nastiest work for minimum wage. A job that is completely at odds with your personal goals can become a potent source of stress, even in the absence of all other variables.

My job was a intense combination of all the above. To compensate for it, it offered unparalleled benefits and autonomy, but none of it made up for the fact that in the end I was slowly becoming a husk of my former self waiting to start living my life. Even worse, over the years I was starting to forget how freeing and enjoyable life can be when not burdened by the ever present stress that drains your life force. Absent other sources of accomplishment and pride, I was starting to replace my identity with my professional title. I knew then that if I didn't take action now, it would be a one way journey to the tragic life of a workaholic. 

Anyways, the point of this post is to make others in a similar boat think about why they are here. If some form of stress/job dissatisfaction is the reason you are here, you owe it to yourself to try to find a solution now instead of wait decades for retirement and watch your best years pass by.

TL;DR: Stress was the reason I became obsessed with FIRE even when I didn't realize it. Leaving my job seems to have changed my perspective over night. Stress can be hard to identify when you have been soaking in it for too long.",financialindependence

753,Weekly budgeting ritual for couples,,1039,ax1cl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ax1cl8/weekly_budgeting_ritual_for_couples/,1551663661.0,"Hi All,

I thought I would share a best case practice I've been working on with my husband for us to build the habit of going over our budget together every week.  We have started the following ritual of going over our personal finances together on the first week of Jan and haven't missed a week yet - we look forward to this a lot. 

Keys to success: we decided on an annual budget in December over the holidays together, then broke it down into a weekly budget. We decided to set a weekly ""date night"" on friday nights, where we combined something we WANT to do (go on a date), with something we HAVE to do (review our finances). We also have a few other traditions/rituals that sweeten the deal. Here's how it looks in practice:

1. On the way home from work on Fridays, I buy him a chocolate bar. We both follow a very healthy diet and have lost a ton of weight doing so, but chocolate bars are the one thing he used to eat all the time and now he doesn't eat. He doesn't buy them on his own, but he LOVES it when I buy one for him. So he enjoys his chocolate bar while we do our finances, which is a little bit of a spoon full of sugar situation and i think has helped make him look forward to it.
2. We sit down at our computers, pull up our weekly spreadsheet, and use the program WAVE (kind of like mint), to pull all our debit/credit card accounts from the last week. We then go through what we spent, categorizing everything into the categories of our pre-set budget. There's no judgement here, we just discuss what we spent and for which category.
3. We run a report in wave to tally all of our various spending categories. We then see if it matches up to our current budget, goes over, or comes in under.
4. If it comes in under, we IMMEDIATELY allocate the amount we came in under budget to our next savings goal (i.e. pay off debt, move to a 529, move to a vacation fund, etc.) THIS IS KEY, it is SO gratifiying to see your money working for you. I think OFTEN during the week before spending on something if it's going to blow my budget because I REALLY look forward to those fridy night payoffs/budget wins.
5. We try as hard as we possibly can to keep this whole ritual to just an hour.
6. IMMEDIATELY after doing so, we go to our favorite restaurant and have a nice romantic evening (we only do this once a week, usually). We love celebrating our ""victories"" and talking about our next goals together.

I came up with this ritual after reading Atomic Habits by James Clear. It's a great book which essentially tricks your mind into solidifying your habits by doing things like habit stacking (we had a ritual of going out to dinner on fridays before this, so we built on that by adding the finance piece first), combing stuff you have to do with stuff you want to do (i.e. I'll only watch netflix on the treadmill or (here) I'll only eat a chocolate bar during budget night), and optimizing the cue-responses- reward mechanism (here: cue: it's friday night, response (better do the budget), reward (KEY: we pay off debt/save for the future/go to dinner). Hope this helps someone else.  So far this year we have been SLAYING our current personal finance goals way ahead of the schedule we set in December, and I credit most of that to this new habit.",financialindependence
754,Journey to FI from an African perspective (27Yr Male),,1041,99nif7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/99nif7/journey_to_fi_from_an_african_perspective_27yr/,1535031984.0,"**Backstory & Context**

I’m a 27-year-old male who lives in Zambia, a southern African country you probably haven’t heard of and that’s a good thing. I’m a Software Engineer by profession and have been working since the age of 21. During this time, I have been able to complete my master’s degree (2016) and buy my own plot of land for 118,000ZMW/$11,800 (2017). I have zero debt and I’m also the primary breadwinner supporting both my parents (retired with no passive income) and a sibling. 

&#x200B;

My countries economy is primarily cash based. Most items, including cars and property, must be bought up-front with very little wiggle room. Credit cards are extremely rare and debit cards are the norm. Several banks and institutions do offer mortgages however they are ridiculously expensive, and most individuals don’t bother with them and construct their houses over a period of 2 to 5 years.

&#x200B;

My take home salary is around $2,900 per month, it terms of PPP that’s equivalent to netting $7,700 in the USA ([http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/](http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/)). Locally, it’s a significant amount of money.

&#x200B;

My current net worth is 368,000ZMW/$36,800 or in $98,000 PPP.

&#x200B;

**Awakening (2017)**

Being financially independent or retiring early was a completely foreign concept for me till early 2017. At this point in time I got a job at a bank and it completely changed the way I looked at finances and income in general. For starters, everyone was much older than me (average age of 55 in the IT department, I kid you not) and by extension already planning for (if not already transitioning into) retirement.

&#x200B;

In this organization, every other member of staff was either the owner of multiple rental properties or a farmer. Furthermore, working with the Financial Markets department introduced me to government bonds and securities, which were a safe and lucrative form of investment. Being exposed to all of this made me feel like I was sleeping at the wheel and just coasting through life (despite being relatively “successful” for my age).

&#x200B;

I have since formulated an “investment roadmap” and created a detailed budget with all projected monthly incomes and expenses laid-out  till December 2026 (Age 35).

&#x200B;

**Step 1 - No Rent and less family expenses (2018 - 2019)**

Phase 1 is to get the heck out of my parents’ house and into my own home. Yes, I still live with them which is a drag, but it also allows me to save 70% of my net income >\_>. As mentioned earlier, I am the sole bread winner and cover 80% of all family expenses, my mums Cake business tops out the rest. Regardless, I am beginning construction of my house this October and expect to wrap up by Mid-2019. Once complete I will move out and won’t be burdened by rent. The total cost of construction will likely top out at 400,000ZMW ($40,000).

&#x200B;

Beyond that, I will help my parents complete a rental property which is currently at roof level. I have already contributed to this project in the past and when all is said and done I would have contributed about $8000 in total. Apart from my parents owning 1 rental property by the end of 2019 they will also begin constructing two more structures once they receive their full retirement benefits in 2020.

&#x200B;

Basically, my parents will be able to support themselves and I should be able to continue saving at least 65% of my take home salary in 2019 and beyond (Age 28).

&#x200B;

**Step 2 – Government Treasury bills (2018 - 2026)**

All Government securities have very competitive rates. Basically, the Bank of Zambia has auctions every fortnight for both competitive and non-competitive securities. See, [http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm](http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm) for details.

&#x200B;

In August 2018, Treasury Bills of 91, 182, 273 and 364-day duration netted yields of 12.5%, 15%, 18.5% and 19.0% respectively. I invested 120,000ZMW ($12,000) into a 364-day T-Bill and will receive 142,000 ($14,200) at maturity in August 2019, minus 15% withholding tax on gains. My “grand plan” is to invest an additional 200,000ZMW ($20,000) per year  into my principle account till the age of 35.

&#x200B;

Assuming the interest rates remain within the historic ranges of (16 to 21%) and inflation stays reasonable I can expect a net income of $30,000 per year, or $2500 per month, by 2026 (Age 35). At that point I will have the option to retire if I wanted to and still maintain a very good quality of life. In terms of PPP, my net monthly income from capital gains alone should be the equivalent of roughly $5,500 in the US.

&#x200B;

Assuming things don’t go according to plan I could delay retirement for another 5 to 7 years (lame) and call it quits in my early 40s. Either way, I now have a clear plan to get out of the rat race in at most a decade.

&#x200B;

**Investment 2- US Company Stocks. (2018 - 2026)**

I’m in the process of completing paperwork which will allow me to purchase stocks from several US Based exchanges. As a non-resident “alien” I will not be required to pay any US capital gains tax (yay).

&#x200B;

I have done research on a handful of companies which I intend to hold value stocks for relatively long-term gains. This won’t be my primary investment but merely a backup in case my local currency was to go to hell or something crazy happened (#TIA).

&#x200B;

I plan on beginning with a modest amount of $3000 in 2018 and based on my performance contribute an additional $2000 to $3000 per year till 2026.

&#x200B;

**Investment 3 – eCommerce. (2020+??)**

Being a software engineer by profession I do intent on transitioning to selling my own products and services soon. While this is merely an idea for now I’m confident in having the bandwidth to peruse this as I gain more financial flexibility and thus free time.

&#x200B;

**Variables**

* A wife and kids could seriously affect my projections. Hopefully she and I will have the same outlook on life and at least a similar income level >\_>
* Economy goes to hell
* Country goes to hell
* World goes to hell

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I had absolutely no plan for retirement till last year. Honestly, I still cant believe I was operating on autopilot for so long. I now have a clear goal, clear metrics to measure against and a set target date. Sure, things may not go according to plan but at least I'm no longer winging it. Assuming I hit my target I plan to spend my free time investing, volunteering, traveling, occasionally consulting and playing Battlefield.",financialindependence
755,Thoughts and decisions that led to debt free with paid off mortgage in early 30’s,,1032,gur5bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gur5bv/thoughts_and_decisions_that_led_to_debt_free_with/,1591039674.0,"My wife and I are early 30’s, have worked hard, caught good breaks, delayed gratification, and have paid off student loans and our mortgage. We are now debt free and own our home outright. 

I realized if you want something different than everyone around you, you will have to do things differently. This may lead to people calling you frugal, or saying you shouldn’t pay off your mortgage. 

Each choice I have made to attack debt or not take on new debt has led to the next, and once you pay off debt it impacts your decision making moving forward. You really don’t want to take on any more debt. It is too much work to pay it off to go through it again. 

I realized after graduation that paying off my student debt in 3 years instead of 15-30 will save $100k +. Lifetime earnings are finite. I turned down my ego, moved in with my parents, worked and worked overtime and put everything I made towards my student loans for 3 years. 

Sacrifice: living with parents for 3 years and driving a $3,500 car while most people in my cohort were living on their own and driving nicer cars

Luck: having parents willing to let me live with them.

I met my now wife, bought an inexpensive home. We continued to drive inexpensive cars and contributed to 401ks / HSAs. Extra money was put in stock for down payment for next house. 

$100k more or less on a new mortgage at ~3% does not change the monthly obligation drastically- it is so easy to take on a big mortgage with today’s rates. I realized the true game changer for us is not having a mortgage. We decided to use the money saved to payoff our current house instead of upgrading to one that would take us 15-20 years to pay off.  It is amazing how much money you pay in interest on a $300k-500k mortgage over a 15 or 20 year period, even with low interest rates. If you think that this is “free money” you probably have not met a banker. Banks are rich off this. 

I don’t necessarily want to retire early. I don’t want a second home. It just puts a huge smile on my face knowing that I am actively choosing to go to work every day and I have no debt / financial obligations. It is really a much more carefree existence, and exponentially more so than when I had “most” of my mortgage paid down. Being grateful for what you have every day and realizing that even owning a car is a luxury in this world is helpful in getting there and avoiding upgrade-itis. Marie Kondo is also helpful- sell the stuff you don’t use and need. Ask yourself- is this item you have or want something you want to take with you into the next part of your life?

Hope this inspires others to do the same, or whatever makes them happy

Edit: this forum cracks me up. I posted here because this forums definition of financial independence is “not having to work for money.” To me, this is different than debt optimization or leverage. If you have a huge mortgage and are choosing not to pay it off despite having significant investment income, the markets will dictate your level of FI at any given time. Are you wealthy? Maybe. Will your money earn more this way over your lifetime? Possibly, or even probably. Do you own your house? No, the bank does. Does a large market downturn mean you are walking around with your pants around your ankles, like a clown? If so, then no, you are not financially independent.",financialindependence

Financial Independence is at its heart about achieving an extreme level of freedom, where constraints are removed. The Obligation of the Mortgage: gone. The Obligation of the Workday: gone. The Obligation of Maintaining A Luxurious Standard Of Living To Impress Your Neighbors: gone. 

Many FI writers imply, or explicitly state, that these obligations should be replaced with your own personal desires after you RE. Some people default to Travel, because on the internet, everyone is supposed to like travel. Some people talk about volunteering in some abstract sense. Some people talk about hobbies. 

It’s easy to see how rich people who fill their lives with nothing after their working careers are miserable. It’s less easy to see, but still fairly visible to careful readers of /r/financialindependence, that filling your life with nice sounding, but basically self-centered wants (self-enrichment through travel, self-enrichment through volunteering) doesn’t do it for a large number of people on anything better than a superficial level. 

I think this is because of a fairly basic mistake in FI thinking. By removing the obligations of material scarcity in your life through savings and investment, you are not removing your obligations as a human being to the culture and society you live in. A financially independent person who wants to avoid a life of meaningless ennui needs to understand that what they do after they stop working needs to be – in large part – determined by your obligations to your fellow human beings. Not by what feels good in the moment.

I don’t mean you need to start a school to teach Financial Independence and the 4% rule to 8th graders. FI is, in many ways, a system hack that will never be available (or even the right choice) for everyone in a society structured like ours. And I’m not saying that need to fight for Full Communism or some overarching political ideology. You don't.

What I am saying is that, once you’ve eliminated material scarcity from your life, a good fraction of your energy needs to go to helping other people in specific and material ways, and which is *not* determined by your desire for self-enrichment, but rather by you obligation to your fellow humans. 

Maybe this means teaching the working class neighbor kid who loves computers how to interact with APIs with python.

Maybe it means starting a business from the ground up built around employee ownership, and with a culture designed to prevent life working there from being a miserable slog to retirement.

Maybe it's a million other things.

But don’t do it to make yourself feel fulfilled. Do it because you’re obligated, as one of the lucky ones.

Tl;dr stop focusing on yourselves or you’ll be fucking miserable. You’ve got to pull other people up behind you.",financialindependence
758,Living aboard a sailboat with a future mini retirement that will take me around the globe.,,1032,b3eu1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b3eu1l/living_aboard_a_sailboat_with_a_future_mini/,1553103033.0,"Hey all,   


I am 28 years old, married, work a typical 9-5 salary job in the engineering world, make just under 100k/year before bonus's and taxes. 

I have taken one mini retirement that lasted just over 2 years before returning to work. I have come to realize that I do not work to earn a living. I work to be able to take retirements throughout my life while working towards financial independence.   


I live aboard a 42ft sailboat with my wife. A lot of people say that boats are a hole in the water you dump money into. I will agree with that except that my cost of living is lower than surrounding neighbors, which means the difference I would spend for having a home/apartment goes into repairs for the boat. That in turn means when I am done with the ""big"" projects, the future expenses are MUCH smaller and geared towards maintaining the vessel in top condition while living in a marina or being capable of taking me around the globe on a longer term plan.  


My sailboat is capable of taking me around the world in comfort. I plan on starting a month-to-month log detailing all the work I have performed, will perform and what I exactly spent on her during the process.   


To start, I spent $20,000 on the initial purchase of her, she was out of the water and had some blisters that needed to be repaired and there was a crack in the keel to keel stub joint that was present that needed to be investigated. That being said, I spent a total of about $3,000 all in on the repairs out of the water while doing all the work myself(professional yard quoted $12k).  


The cost of my moorage is $595/month, add in power and live aboard fees brings my total bill per month up to right around $730/month(flucuates about $5-$10/month based on how much power we consume). In comparison, if I rented a place near where I moor, I'd be spending around $1800/month for a 1bd/bath apartment at the low end.   


In the end, my goal is to spend the next 2-3 years working, rebuilding the boat and saving up to go circumnavigate the world aboard her with my wife.   


I am projecting to spend around another $15k in repairs to bring the boat into a state that will support my dreams of sailing the world.

\-----**Other Details-----**

* When I was in my late 20’s I told my co-workers that I may very well be retired by the time I’m 35. Now I’m 35 and haven’t received a paycheck in over a year. The last time that was true was 20 years ago. In a sense, I have retired; from corporate employment at least. I’m no where close to FI, but I’ve successfully escaped the drudgery, confusion and inadequacy I felt throughout my tenure in corporate employment. My days are still full of confusion and inadequacy but now with an equal measure of excitement, discovery and ownership. When I talked about FI/ER early in my journey I always added the caveat that I was still open to finding “my calling”. Some people in the world seem to find their work fulfilling. They are happy spending the hours of their life at work because the sense of purpose or even the work itself was worth more to them than the wage they get as a bonus on top.  “I’m still open to finding that!” I would say, mostly trying to keep that hope alight in myself. I knew that I have a propensity towards cynicism and bitterness that could make for a lonely, hollow retirement if FI/ER became the mission instead of the means. Well I’m happy to say that I’m closer to finding that purpose than I’ve ever been before! And wow have I developed some maladaptive, bad habits from my years in the FI grind. . .
* My side-gig has indeed turned into a full-time entrepreneurial venture. I’m one of a founding team of 3 building software, talking to prospects, empathizing with their problems and trying to invent solutions. Basically all of the things I saw my “fulfilled” peers doing in my past jobs. Why wasn’t I paying attention!? Why couldn’t I find the motivation or investment they so clearly felt!? Besides being told I was special a few too many times as a kid, I’ve identified a few of the reasons here:

1. I definitely have some form of ADD. I finally got a meth prescription and found out what I’d been missing. I now wake up earlier and faster, can focus on work longer, and procrastinate less. I’m not thrilled about changing my brain chemistry to conform to a society and lifestyle I see as unsustainable and anti-humanitarian, but it’s not that different from conforming my lifestyle while saving for FI. I see it as a debt I’ll have to pay-off when I have the wealth to return to authenticity. Or maybe I’ll just become someone who doesn’t worry about that kind of thing. No sense in tiptoeing through life only to arrive safely at death.
2. I REALLY need to know how organizations work and what is expected of me to feel valuable. When I didn’t understand a task in my past roles, I would ask my boss for clarity. If they couldn’t give me a good answer, I would ask them to ask their boss. If nothing that respected my time and commitments to the company came back that was the moment I checked out. My personal north star would change from working towards a shared goal to minimizing investments (time, stress) on a fixed return (my paycheck). Well now, I am the whole machine, I have access to every part of it and if it stops working, no one else is going to fix it. It’s not stress free, but it’s pretty damn clear how and why I’m valuable.
3. Society was not resistant to my comfort without hard work on my part. Basically, individuals who look and sound like me don’t always need to be invested or motivated to land jobs, earn high incomes, win scholarships, avoid being fired, etc. All statistical commentary on demographics aside, I, as an individual, definitely benefited from this privilege in many invisible and uncountable ways. (This is the seed of those maladaptive bad habits I was talking about.) As a startup founder and hopeful government contractor, it’s becoming not uncommon for me to run into opportunities stating up front that priority will be given to people with genders, races and qualities other than my own. My lizard brain wants to play the victim in these moments, but it’s always easy to get perspective. Given that I had no choice in the matter, I guess I’d rather have had the privilege. I often say that the point of privilege is to use it and to me that means creating value, eliminating the causes of privilege in the first place, and having compassion and empathy for everyone I meet. It’s a real shame that the privilege that put me in such a good position to do all that also allowed me to skip the skill-building work that I now NEED desperately to actually execute on any of it.
4. Another reason is that I didn’t have any real mentors. I wanted them, but I failed to simply ask people I respected for mentorship. I’m much more comfortable giving advice than getting it (see: [update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6bjp0r/three_years_after_100k_update_3/)), which is comical given my relatively narrow life experience. The consequence of this is that I compartmentalized the people in my life who knew I was professionally dysfunctional from the people who had any power or ability to help me with it. Eventually, working towards FI/RE began to help with this, since as I gained some financial security I started feeling like I could take some risks at work. I chose to negotiate harder, WFH more brazenly and ask for bigger raises, but I could have also been more open with my bosses and humbly asked for help. At the time, that felt like exposing myself to the risk of firing. Maybe that’s exactly what would have happened, but I wish I’d run the experiment to find out. It was definitely confusing to feel completely checked out, ask for unearned privileges, and get them. If this sounds like living the dream to you, beware that you’re essentially just compressing the multi-generational tragedy of trust fund babies into one person (yourself).
5. Finally, no one seemed to notice!  This one is totally crazy to me. If you notice people like me in your organization, please say something to them. They are probably feeling trapped between golden handcuffs and imposter syndrome. It’s really Office Space out there. When I first saw that movie it was a comedy, but now it’s a tragedy. How can employers ask for most of your waking hours and not even notice this is happening!? If I get so lucky as to actually employ others someday, I’m going to notice. I knew I was the only one responsible for my thoughts, words, actions, habits and character. I chose, consciously or through omission, to live in that state for years. If you work hard and notice yourself resenting someone like this, ask them to work with you. Tell them you’d be personally grateful if they did some specific, measurable task for you. Explain why it’s important and how it fits into your duties. You’ve got a super-power they don’t have, and you can share it without losing it yourself.  A sense of purpose and accomplishment are non-rivalrous goods.

* My main focus in life is now company building instead of wealth building, which feels nice. I’d still like to be FI, but I don’t really have a date or a number anymore. My goal of $1.1M is just what I see as responsible in my current lifestyle, but we could sell our house and be FI in Costa Rica or Estonia today.  I don’t visit the FI subreddits, and I rarely check my investments on even a weekly basis.
* Airbnb hosting has become easy and streamlined. We’ve had over 80 guests and are a well oiled machine at this point. Sometimes guests come and go without us ever even seeing them in person. We use an integrated smart lock and an auto-messaging and pricing service on two single room listings. I haven’t done a rigorous financial assessment but I’d guess that it’s profitable from P/L perspective but that we earn a low hourly wage on our time.  Factoring in the people we’ve met, the area we get to live in, and the quality of life we experience from the home, it’s probably worth it to us but only including the intangibles. If there were zero switching costs, I’d probably choose to live in a well managed condo, or small single family home.
* I was not able to de-program from work-life in the way that I thought I would after I was laid off last year. My side-gig swelled to fill the time and I basically keep business working hours now. Being an entrepreneur has made it more difficult to stay fit, foster community, travel, play music, and cultivate my primary relationship. These were all the things that I valued outside of work during my years in corporate. They kept me sane and I thought I would invest in them even more once I was done. On the other hand, being focused and purpose driven has made me much more intentional and effective outside the entrepreneurial work too. Ultimately, I’m not sure I’m unhappy with the balance in my life. I’m still fit enough, and I travel for leisure some. I play less music and some communities I valued have faded while others are springing up. My relationship with my partner is better than ever and it’s the last thing on the list I’m willing to compromise.
* My SO had a big jump in income in the last year. They are basically killing it, and enabling me to start this company without actually spending our savings on it. They have always been a happy worker with a tremendous work ethic. It’s one of the things I admire most about them. I keep an eye out for resentment about our disparate incomes but so far we are both happy with the current arrangement. I’ll either bring this company into profitability or jump back into the workforce to push us past $1.1M at light speed.
* **Tip for the year:** If you are struggling with the FI grind and corporate ennui, spend some of that savings rate on a professional coach. It’s like therapy but with metrics. I’ve found it tremendously valuable and wish I’d thought of it sooner.
* **Ask for the year:** Has anyone here built a profitable B2B SaaS company? If so, would you be willing to chat with me about it? Send me a DM!

Back in 2010 when the ACA was passed, a few restrictions were placed on HSAs to help balance the revenue projections of that law.  One of them included a prohibition on over-the-counter medications without a prescription, which makes it a little harder to withdraw money from an HSA without penalty.

Well, thanks to a very minor technical change that's easy to miss on page 364 of the [COVID-19 stimulus bill,](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20200325223111/FINAL-FINAL-CARES-ACT.pdf) that's about to change.  See below:

I am a long-time (11 years) redditor and have been very lightly engaged in this subreddit for much of that time. I’ve created this alternate account specifically for personal Accountability, as well as a way to Interact with the reddit FIRE community. Here’s what I mean by that:

**Accountability**

* One key enabler of my ability to RE is a very early start to index fund investing, and a set-it-and-forget-it approach.
* Perhaps not surprisingly, I haven’t been very active in actually **planning** to FIRE, and I’ve developed certain lazy behaviors in the intervening years. I could have been more aggressive with my current career. I should have been more thoughtful about real estate decisions. I could have done a better job communicating my specific FIRE goals to my wife (she’s now on board). Etc.
* So, I’m looking to drive more Accountability for myself in actually taking concrete steps to RE. And, there are some specific milestones that I’m setting for myself.
* Obviously, an anonymous account doesn’t drive Accountability terribly well, being anonymous and all. But I’m giving a go nonetheless. As many in this community know, communicating FIRE goals with your friends and family as a means to Accountability is fraught AF. I don’t care to blog. So I’m putting it all on you.

**Interaction**

* I personally find the Personal Journey content in this community to be the most engaging, though the technical and financial discussions are helpful as well.
* I suspect that most of my contributions will be of the “how it’s going/what it’s like/what I’ve learned” sort, versus robust financial advice. But I’ll share what advice I can. Think of the updates you see from[ u/FIRE\_and\_forget\_it](https://www.reddit.com/u/FIRE_and_forget_it)  and[ u/jasonlong1212](https://www.reddit.com/u/jasonlong1212) … that is what I envision.
* This also obviously runs the risk of being solipsistic and indulgent. So I apologize in advance and graciously accept your downvote.

With that Purpose out of the way, here’s some deets around yours truly:

**Quick Demographic info**

* I am a Gen-X American white male. Married with no children. All of our close relatives are self-sufficient. We are generally healthy (though with pre-existing conditions) and very in-shape for our age. We have a social network in the Goldilocks zone. Our community reflects our values.
* Right away, you can see the privilege. More on that below.
* I currently live in a large city in the Northern half of the US. I have lived in several different cities in my life, but spent the vast majority of my career in a single region of the US.

**My Educational Background and Career (the over-long section … tl;dr at the end)**

* **Public Schools.** The most consequential test I ever took was in 5th grade. I grew up in a public school system with several tracks of study at the Middle and High school level, the most advanced of which was called Gifted & Talented. The test I took alongside all of my peers in 5th grade happened to put me in the G&T track starting my first year of Middle school. I didn’t even know what the test was for at the time. It was easy sailing from there on out, literally through college, kicking off a virtuous cycle of achievement and positive reinforcement. This is surely an indictment of the US public school system.
* **State University.** I moved around a bit as a kid, which did not advantage me in terms of developing a record of extra-curricular achievement, reputation and rapport within any given school. Consequently, many of my friends I grew up with “back home” ended up going to some really prestigious schools (the Ivies and the ilk), whereas I went to a large public University system in-state with a fair amount of scholarship support. This was a huge blessing in retrospect. It was an incredible bargain, and I graduated with zero debt.
* **First Job.** A year after graduation, and after a … light academic adventure, let’s say … I started applying for jobs. I had probably applied to 10 or so companies when I was asked to come in to interview at a local software company. The interview process was very rigorous, and I think describing it in detail may give away too much. Not FAANG though, (in fact, there was no FNG at the time, and barely a second A), and nowhere near FAANG-level compensation, at least initially. I was offered a job over the phone one Friday afternoon, and started work the following Monday AM. My starting salary was $31K. The job search lasted probably two months. I realize this sounds crazy nowadays.
* **Career Path.** My career trajectory from that point has been: software > MBA > consulting > corporate gig. That “gig” term is carrying a lot of weight. On paper, each of these moves looks like a step-up in salary, but in reality each represents an unintentional down-shifting of earning growth. I can elaborate on that if there’s interest. I’ve been working full time non-stop (except for the full-time MBA) for over 20 years now. I can elaborate on the value of a full time MBA if there’s interest.
* **Lucking Out.** As I look back on this education and career trajectory, I feel like I was getting through some really critical gates just before they got tougher to pass through. That G&T exam in 5th grade was barely a blip on anyone’s radar (I think), but now I suspect parents view it as a make-or-break moment for their child (if it exists anymore). AP courses were just becoming prevalent after I left high school, so that wasn’t a big stressor for me. My University was still easy-ish to get into (a two-page application without an essay, if I recall correctly). College tuition really didn’t explode until after I was out. The software company I joined was very particular in who we hired, but didn’t really didn’t draw large numbers of applicants until after I joined. I was oblivious to any career guidance and interviewing/application support at my university. It probably existed, but I view that as a reflection on how unserious we were about competing for jobs in the 90’s. Maybe it’s a Gen-X thing.
* **Modest Spending the past 20 years.** All along the way, my appetite for material things, and consequently large expenses, has remained relatively modest. There are vices here and there (eating out at nice restaurants, international travel, organic groceries, craft beer), but on balance, I have deliberately not cared much at all about the Joneses. Maybe it’s a Gen-X thing. Obviously, not having kids is probably the single-biggest variable here. So, I’ve been able to sock away a fair bit, and invested it primarily in broad-based mutual funds. My grandpa opened an S&P500 index fund for me with probably about $500 when I was very young and barely able to understand the concept (maybe when I was 13). At age 23, without really thinking, I just started adding to that. Again, privileged. I would estimate my lifetime savings rate at over 50%, but I haven’t seriously calculated it.

I tell you all of this to emphasize that I didn’t blaze my own way to FI, not really. But there are still lessons to be had (more below).

**TL;DR**: heads-down student, unstrategic and overall lucky career trajectory, modest spending levels, DINK, all generating what you might call “passive-aggressive” saving.

**The Numbers**

* Our net worth is currently $2.4M, setting aside the value in RSUs that I would forfeit if I RE’d right now.
* The vast majority of this is in index funds, split between Taxable and Retirement accounts. I have about an equal split between Taxable and Retirement, though not due to any deliberate strategy, and is something I probably haven’t given enough thought to. I have about $100K in home equity and a bit in cash that makes up the balance of the net worth.
* My relatively small proportion of net worth in home equity reflects my own belief that I would be better off investing in the broader equities market versus local real estate market (i.e., my home). I may or may not have been correct in that belief, I truly don’t know.
* Very little of this originated as equity compensation until recently, even from my software days (which is a sad tale for another time).
* Our 10-year trend in non-healthcare spending is about $65K/year. A fair chunk of this year-in and year-out is Home Improvement, which is shocking and sad to me.
* Based on certain assumptions around income next year, tax rates in retirement, stock market valuations, RSU vesting, and healthcare premiums and other costs, if I were to RE at the beginning of 2022 (a year and a half from now), our WR would be 3.2%. This WR is about what we’re comfortable with. For context, a WR of 3.5% would allow for $75K in non-health spending, which we’ve never exceeded in the past 10 years.

**How I Got Here/Advice if you’re interested**

(Thanks to[ u/CripzyChiken](https://www.reddit.com/u/CripzyChiken)  for ideas to make this post more helpful than it was about to be.)

Moving beyond my own biography, here are some things that I think enabled our ability to FIRE:

* **Appreciate the power of compounding interest**. As a former student of economics, I refuse to call it “magic.” But **saving early** has non-intuitive benefits. Debating between saving $15/month vs spending it on HBO? You won’t remember what you watched on HBO ten years from now, but you’ll certainly enjoy knowing that extra $3K gets you much closer to retirement.
* **Think in terms of Opportunity Cost, constantly.** This is a concept I think most of us know, but which seems so overlooked when I see my friends’ and family’s spending behaviors. The incremental expense you take on now isn’t just a trade-off at the moment of purchase, it’s something that has long-term consequences of what that cash could have provided you. Similar to the HBO example, I like[ MMM’s swimming pool example](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/07/25/the-twenty-dollar-swim/) even more. This has the unfortunate consequence of being debilitating (is anything truly worth it?), but is a good baseline attitude to have.
* **Understand your values with respect to material things.** As a household, we spend $65K/year. That’s not nothing. But we definitely under-index in spending relative to our peer group here. And we’re more than OK with that. In fact, we are looking to downsize and economize with our next home. Life is to be lived, sure, but it doesn’t hurt to think about what things deliver happiness to you versus what social pressure would have you spend. I currently drive a Honda Civic that I bought in 2011. My previous car was a Honda Civic that I drove for 14 years.
* **The ROI on a graduate degree may be iffy**. I can elaborate in future posts, but my decision to get an MBA likely had a profoundly negative ROI. A graduate degree is by no means a ticket to a better financial outcome, and the opportunity cost you pay in taking time off of work should be measured not only in terms of the year or two you take off work, but also all of the foregone goodwill you would have otherwise created in your field. Happy to elaborate if there’s interest.
* **Deliberate career decisions with those you trust,** ideally with more experience than you. A story for another time, but my leaving the software company when I did was arguably the most consequential financial decision I ever made (and not in a good way). If I were to do it over, I would have consulted my dad and others 20+ years my elder for their view. (Correct, I did not run the idea past my dad - I have an independent streak.) I’m sure I would have been advised to wait it out a year or two. And, in my case, if I had followed that advice, I would definitely be retired by now, no question.
* **Understand that you have tax and healthcare burdens when you think about a SWR.** Too often I see people in this subreddit compare annual expenses to net worth, and believe that they’re golden when that ratio dips below 4%. You need to account for capital gains taxes (potentially at the state level too), as well as healthcare insurance premiums that you’d incrementally incur when estimating future expenses. In my case, I will need to draw down my investments by $95K/year to fund my non-healthcare spending of $65K/year, though I do live in a high tax State.

**Acknowledgements**

* The biggest contributor to my ability to FIRE is the profound privilege I experience as a white American male. It’s probably obvious from the above, but I have encountered very few material hurdles in my life.
* One one hand, I haven’t actually received an obscene amount of financial support from others after graduating high school. My parents helped to pay for some living expenses early on in college, through perhaps my Sophomore year, but tuition and later expenses were covered by my scholarships and through my part-time jobs. I stayed at their home for the two months-long job search, but moved out shortly after that. I covered the down payment on my first house (I think many Americans get support from their parents on this, though it doesn’t seem to be discussed much in polite company).
* On the other hand, I am by no means self-made. In fact, I feel the opposite. The non-financial investments my parents made in me were significant. And, I’ve been on the receiving end of this country’s firehose of white privilege since birth. Since before birth, if you think about it. In a sense I have a different kind of debt that I believe I need to pay. More on that in post-FIRE posts, I hope.

**Why FIRE sooner versus later**

* **I do not draw meaning from my work**. I undoubtedly have an impact on the company, create shareholder value, etc. But my company’s mission is not something that fulfills me at a personal level.
* **I am a tired imposter.** While I fully acknowledge how easy I’ve had it in the grand scheme of things, I have been working pretty damn hard for 20+ years. Early on, in software and consulting, the hours and effort and travel were insane. Insane! Nowadays, thankfully, it’s just a low-level burning grind, but it’s still taxing. I do somehow feel a cumulative mental wear-and-tear from work over the past 20+ years. I don't handle stress as well as I used to. I should be supremely in-control of the work and team by now, but I don’t feel I am. And I feel like an imposter oftentimes: my Millennial and Gen-Z colleagues (how’d THAT happen so fast?) are twice as bright and three times as productive as I ever remember being. Maybe I’m just getting old. Maybe it’s a Gen-X thing.
* **I owe.** Even though this is an anonymous account, I realize this will sound self-aggrandizing -- but this fucked-up year has really opened my mind to my privilege and I need to do something more. It’s time for me to get off the pot and create a domino of openings for others at the company who have had to work a lot harder than me to get where they are. This is a concrete and specific thing, and my company would almost certainly take it as an opportunity to increase diverse representation (my company is serious AF about this issue now). So, I intend to quit within two years, ideally at the beginning of 2022, depending on certain constraints.

The above are the immediate drivers, and may seem to violate the “create the life you want and then save for it” credo of FIRE, but to me it does not. I have a very happy life outside of work, which I intend to maximize post-FIRE. My retirement will be overfilled with a backlog of interests groaning to expand. The above are just pushing me to an earlier vs later RE date.

**Next Steps for Me**

Why am I setting my RE date at the beginning of 2022 instead of right now? There are a few constraints I need to work through:

* Constraint 1: Healthcare coverage. While we are generally healthy, we have pre-existing conditions that I worry will impact our ability to secure coverage upon RE. The ACA is currently being challenged in the Supreme Court on severability grounds, and I believe it will be heard in October 2020.  A decision will likely come by June 2021, so that is an important milestone for me.
* Constraint 2: COVID and Mortgages. We would really like to move out of our current home to a smaller home in a different location in the metro area for the first many years of FIRE. I know that asset-based mortgages are a thing. But I would much prefer getting into a traditional mortgage, and then RE after that. We are choosing to wait until after the pandemic is resolved (however that happens) before we get out into the market, and show our home for sale. So, I don’t expect to put our current house on the market until late 2021 at the earliest.
* Constraint 3: RSUs. Some of my RSUs vest in early 2022, so would be worth waiting out even if RE were possible earlier than the above two constraints seem to allow. This is of course the goal of RSUs.

Immediate next steps I’m taking:

* Constraint 2: Make a plan around moving to a new home. This still involves a build-buy decision we need to make. I have a lot of research to do.
* Also: Build a relationship with community organizations in the coming months, so I have a plan for post-FIRE engagement in my community. I have plenty of interests that will divide my time, but none of them really contribute to the community meaningfully.
* Also: Stay employed until then. No small thing -- I know how close I am to RE, and my energy and motivation to exceed expectations at work is flagging. Stated differently: the senioritis is real. Granted, I will be fine if I were laid off tomorrow, and perhaps needn’t work full time again. But I’d much prefer to keep to my plan.

This post may not be particularly intriguing now, and may not generate much interaction. But consider this the first entry that I’m hoping you all can come back to as I journal my FIRE journey in the coming years.

In the meantime, what would you like to see in updates going forward? I will share what I can.

Finally, to the Millennial and Gen-Z redditors who aspire to FIRE: I am sorry for the fucked up world you are in. You will face many more challenges to save for retirement than I (and especially the Boomers) ever have, and you do not deserve that. I am in awe of your resilience (I see it all the time at work), and I am trying to do my part to make it better. Keep at it!

**TL;DR:** American guy wants you to read about his FIRE journey in the coming years as a means to his achieving personal accountability. This is a “kick-off post” of little immediate interest, and likely worthy of your downvote, but may be something to read again later on in the journey to see how well he stuck to his goal. He also wants to know what you want to hear from him about.

**Edit:** I appreciate all of the early responses, I can feel the accountability growing -- yikes!  A quick note as a number of you have told me not to apologize for being white.  I think I understand where you are coming from, but I didn't intend this to seem like an apology per se.  I mean only to emphasize the reality in my own life that so much opportunity has come from this.  I understand the point some of you make that there are examples of privileged individuals from all races.  I would offer this way to think about it: Let's take the one example of the critical G&T test I took in 5th grade.  I was able to take that test because my parents moved into a plum public school district, which they were able to do because they were able to get a nice(ish) home, which they were able to do through rolling over the home equity from another city, where they were unencumbered by redlining because our family was white.  Now, multiply that by everyone I went to school with in that district (not every family had the same path, sure, but the systemic privilege exists).  It wasn't just me in that boat at school, and I can count on one hand how many Black friends I had at that school.  At any rate, I will likely not change any minds here, and while this is a deeply held belief of mine, I will probably delve little to not-at-all into this in future posts.

**Edit:**  I have updated the post to fix a violation of a posting rule.

**Edit:** Just to set expectations on the Interaction note, I will probably not post again on this topic until Spring 2021.  I've been advised that every 6 months to 1 year is about the sweet spot for update frequency.  Thanks for the engagement on this post.",financialindependence

765,200K Net Worth at 28 - My Journey,,1012,ej7m2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ej7m2d/200k_net_worth_at_28_my_journey/,1578013477.0," It’s not the biggest or craziest number out there at 28 years old, but it’s something (most) people can probably attempt to replicate if they are just starting out. These numbers are all mine, there is no second income taken into account and I don’t have any support from anyone else (I.e., someone living with me and splitting rent).

Obviously, some things have had to break my way to get here. The most importantly being I started my career in 2013, so the returns in the market over the last 6+ years have certainly helped. I also chose to live at home for almost four years after college until age 26. I know not everybody is afforded this opportunity, and some people would rather pay to live on their own than with their parents, but it was a choice I made that greatly helped, and I’m extremely grateful to my parents for letting me do this. I’ve obviously seen good growth in my salary over the last 6+ years as well, and while that’s due to a lot of hard work, there’s obviously some lucky breaks needed there as well. I graduated college with a little over $50,000 in student loans, but no other real debt to my name. 

Up until 2017 my rent expenses were $0, but I was dating someone who lived in a HCOL city, who earned a low salary, so I covered everything we did together (~1000/month). In 2017, my rent expenses went up to $1,300/month, and in 2018 when I purchased my home my mortgage/taxes/insurance went to $2,200/month. 

I try to live frugally for the most part, but still enjoy traveling (R/churning funds most of this), eating at nice restaurants, and trying to say “yes” to most things I get asked to do/go.

I started my career in 2013 at an insurance company in a MCOL area. I’ve stayed with this same company over the last 6+ years and have held a few jobs within the company over that time. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration (concentration in Finance) with no designations and no master’s degree.
My Career (Salary wise) has looked like this:

**2013:** $53,000

**2014:** $56,000 (raise)

**2015:** $61,500 (raise)

**2016:** $64,500 (raise)

**2016:** $73,500 (promotion)

**2017:** $75,000 (raise)

**2018:** $77,000 (raise)

**2019:** $111,000 (promotion)

**2019:** $117,500 (lateral move)

I grew up in a household with financially responsible parents and I studied finance in college so I understood compounding interest and the effect it would have on my 401K. The first 5 years of my employment I contributed 18% with an 8% match. When I purchased a house in 2018, I dropped that number to 7% with an 8% match.

My 401K over that time has looked like this:

**2013:** $2,000

**2014:** $15,000

**2015:** $27,000

**2016:** $46,000

**2017:** $75,000

**2018:** $86,000

**2019:** $123,000

Part of the reason I've never left my company is because I've seen opportunity for growth here (Not every millennial is bouncing around different companies to leverage raises), but another big part is the benefits. 5 Weeks PTO (6 weeks in 2 more years), 8% 401k match, $30/month for Health Insurance, $1500 a year towards student loan repayments, $6000 a year towards tuition assistance, 8 minute commute to work, starbucks on campus, free gym on campus, work from home occasionally, and a pretty good culture and work life balance, which I weight all of that heavily. I really can't see myself leaving even if another company offered me a pretty decent raise.

I started keeping track of my Net Worth on a monthly basis in October of 2016. The link below is a screenshot of my graph.

Obviously, this is bad for the economy since it means people aren't spending, but I thought this was an interesting case study to the oft-asked question, *what would happen to the American economy if everyone saved 30-50% of their income?*, which is typically cited as a baseline saving rate for FIRE. Seems like for FIRE to work we need only a small % of people to be on the FIRE track and the rest to be spending to make sure the economy keeps growing.",financialindependence

Here are screenshots of the Mint Trends, which has every single expense from the past year categorized.  I've added comments on each page.

[**Expenses Overview**](https://i.imgur.com/qk7ZwDM.png)

[Auto Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/MMjwVUE.png)

[Food Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/wk7TgOm.png)

[Home Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/MLAOnxS.png)

[Utility Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/qslLk4f.png)

[Tax Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/AdkWVZk.png)

[Healthcare Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/upxiRUs.png)

[Entertainment Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/bKd5Ycb.png)

Main takeaways, my total expenses for the year was $37,700, but I'm going to dismiss about $15,000 of that as ""one time"" expenses from paying off my car and my furniture loan.  A more reasonable number for my annual spend is $22,700.

With my car payment gone, my highest expense category is Food, averaging $500 per month.  This has room for improvement. 

Healthcare will look artificially low last year because of taking Tax Credits up front.  This year I am not and will be paying $325 per month for health insurance.  At ~$4000 per year, this puts healthcare at nearly 20% of my total expenses.

Nothing else is particularly interesting.  That $22,700 figure is a reasonable real-world number for me, but for future planning I'd still inflate that to $25,000 just to have more wiggle room.  I may look into traveling this year, which would add some expense.

**Investments:**

Vanguard Investments: (All in VTSAX)

* Traditional IRA:  $299,000 -> $348,000
* Roth IRA: $14,500 -> $18,150
* Brokerage: $18,400 -> $22,900

* **Total Rollup**: $331,800 -> $389,100.  ~17% return

Other LTCG holdings: $145,000 -> $291,000 (other investment accounts and bitcoin)

HSA Investment Account: $6000 -> $7400, with another $1700 in the ""cash"" holdings of the HSA.

$9000 cash in Money Market & Checking Account.

**Finances Going Forward**

I had earned income last year so I didn't start my Roth Conversion Ladder last year.   This year I decided I will be converting the $12,400 standard deduction + $9600 of the first tax bracket for a nice round $22,000 converted.   Yes I'll owe a little bit of taxes, but it sets up my Roth with $22k in 5 years which should cover the majority of my expenses.  And with $350k currently in tIRA and converting $22,000 per year, I won't be able to chew through it all before actual retirement age.

I have about $20k from an old stock purchase plan that unlocks come April, which I will be selling and likely moving over to my money market account to shore up my ""cash"" holdings.

My plan is to not really tap any of my ""normal"" investment accounts for as long as possible.  I've been deferring to selling Bitcoin if I need to move some cash over.  Last year I sold 3 bitcoin, one for $9300 in June, and then two at the end of December (for tax year Capital Gains reasons) for $7300 each.  These were all LTCG at 0% taxed.   AGI for last year is around $35,000.  

**The Living Part:**

There's all the boring expenses and financial stuff.  Now for the ever painful question that my beloved Grandmother loves to ask, ""But gosh, what do you do with all of your time!  I can't imagine being retired at your age!""

Step 1, restful sleep.  During my working career I lived off 6 hours of sleep every day.  It made for exhausting weekends trying to ""make it up.""  And luckily I'm not a generally stressful person or else it'd have been worse.  But now I go to bed when I'm tired, and whenever I naturally wake up, I get up.  This can lead to VERY weird hours since I'm often an extreme night owl.   But I generally get 9-10 perfect restful uninterrupted dream-filled hours of sleep.

I'm betrayed by my ""Food Expense"" breakdown, but I really am cooking more and eating better.  I drink a lot of coffee and water at home and generally try to eat only one meal per day, but sometimes lunch and dinner.  I don't normally eat breakfast, just have coffee when I wake up.  And did I mention how much less painful it is to go grocery shopping when it's in the middle of the day and everyone's at work.  It's so nice.

I spend a lot of time on reddit browsing my front page, and I check out the YouTubers I follow that post daily, then check out any of the irregular posters.   Depending on how much good stuff there is, this could go on for a few hours.

I have a lot of hours playing video games.  I tend toward puzzle games or building games (Factorio, Satisfactory) because they scratch that itch in my engineering brain.   There are times at night where I'll spend **hours** on this website: https://www.puzzle-sudoku.com/ and play Sudoku or Nonograms or any of the other puzzle types on the bottom of the page.

I'm doing my best to watch every single last show on Netflix.  It's a daunting task, though it's surprising how often I drift back toward watching the same smattering of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes rather than try something new.  But I try and take recommendations and work my way through shows.

And Podcasts!   The joy of joys is when I come across a new-to-me podcast that has a huge backlog.  I found a great ST:TNG rewatch podcast that had 108 episodes already done.  I spent like 2 months watching the episode of TNG then immediately listening to their podcast about that episode, repeat repeat repeat.   I'm currently working my way through The Adventure Zone, I'm on episode 46 of 155 with them.  And they keep advertising the other podcasts The McElroys do so I'm sure I'll roll into one of those next.   For many people podcasts are background noise, but I'll often just sit on the couch and concentrate on just listening the podcast.

Outside of home, I can't wait for the weather to get nicer so I can go on more walks.  Being a night owl I like going for walks at night.  I live near our city center so I'm within blocks of city hall, the main library branch, and the fountain / park.

I jump at any opportunity to hang out with friends.  It's just about every weekend that we are getting together to hang out and play board games.  Like I mentioned in one of the breakdowns, I've started to play D&D with my buddy and his wife.  I'd never played before but he's been DMing for years (but hasn't had a group for 10+ years now).  He's glad to be playing again, his wife **loves** it, and it's super convenient for them to stay home with the 5 month old daughter.  (And baby gets to hang out with Uncle Oracle.)

I get together with former co-workers every few months to keep in touch with them.  One in particular I have a standing every-2-month bar date with.   I remind them every so often that if they want to go out to lunch **ever** to just call me.

**Personal History**

Just a quick personal history in closing.  I was an automotive engineer working for OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in the Metro Detroit area.  In the 2008 downturn I lost my job and was unemployed for 2 years and ended up getting my house foreclosed in 2010.  By the time i got a job in March of 2010 I was basically at $0.  I had a tiny amount in an 401k, had about $20,000 in credit card debt from being unemployed.

But then I got a very well paying engineering job ($108k annual and eligible for time-and-half overtime).  I kept living like I was unemployed, spent as little as possible and saved as much as possible.  Through my parents I secured a mortgage on a nice 1 Bed / 1 Bath 900 sq ft condo.  I paid off my CC debt in less than a year and kept banking cash and maxing my 401k every year.

I heard about bitcoin in early 2013 (from a guildmate in World of Warcraft, believe it or not) and jumped on board.  [All time bitcoin price chart (log scale) for those unfamiliar with the history.](https://i.imgur.com/NkJ2BMR.png) I got in before the first spike to $1000 in December of 2013, and kept buying throughout the downswing in 2014 / 2015.   In 2017 I sold 5.6 BTC for a total of $6000 and paid off the last of my student loans and my car, then a few months later I sold 4.25 BTC for $6700 and paid off the last of my condo mortgage.  So in May of 2017 I was officially debt free and had a net worth of about $200,000.

Then in the fall of 2017 was when bitcoin exploded.  I knew I had to take profits here.   Every time the price went up 10% I sold another bitcoin.  $7500, $9000, $10700, $13000, $15500, $18600.  I sold all the way up.   I ended up selling about $100,000 in bitcoin that year and I pushed most of it into my Roth IRA and Brokerage accounts.

Then I really started thinking about FIRE in early 2018.  Started doing the math, tried to see what my expenses would be, and thought I'd give it ago.   I've told myself from day 1 that I'd give this trial a solid 2 years.   If I don't feel good about it, or the money doesn't seem right, then I'll still only be 40 years old and could (IMO) easily jump right back into an engineering gig.  So I targeted early 2019 so I could frontload my 401k for two months, grab the annual bonus, then peace out.

769,My first six months of FIRE,,1004,ayen19,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ayen19/my_first_six_months_of_fire/,1551977029.0,"TLDR: I FIREd six months ago and it’s everything I hoped it would be. Don’t sweat the details and enjoy life as you pursue FIRE.

March 7, 2019 marks six months since my last day at work. I enjoy reading updates from folks who have FIREd so I figure I might as well add my story to this collection of success stories. One thing that’s changed for me since my beginning on this sub is that I don’t judge other people’s decisions. I used to think that people like MMM couldn’t consider themselves retired since their blog was really their full time job now. I no longer feel that way. Our definition of retirement is solely our own.

**First the background**

I’m not using a throwaway account and my identity is easy to discover so I won’t be using any actual figures. Suffice to say I’m on the fat side of FIRE but by most definitions, it’s pretty low on the Fat scale.

After graduating college I began my career in Television News. Within four years I was at the number one national news show as an editor. I spent seven years in that role before moving on to producing and then as a technology trainer. My income was higher than average but in no way close to some of the software engineers or doctors on this sub.

In 1997 my girlfriend’s (now wife) house burned down and we were able to turn tragedy into triumph by investing the insurance money as we rebuilt the house. That enabled what came next.

In 2000 we got married and my wife made a bit more money than I did. While early retirement wasn’t really on the radar at this time, financial independence certainly was and she and I were totally on the same page. The same year we got married we also: bought a vacation home with three apartments that we also rented out, bought our first boat, bought a – I know I’m going to get killed for this by this sub – timeshare. Like other things, just because you don’t find value in something doesn’t mean others don’t. We’ve enjoyed our timeshare and we really enjoy it now that I’m retired.

In 2009 we bought our second vacation rental property this time in California. We had spent the last nine years vacationing in CA at least twice a year and we purchased this property in our favorite area. Our incomes continued to rise and our rentals were another stream of income.

**Lifestyle inflation**

I know this is frowned upon on this sub but I believe that some lifestyle inflation is not only inevitable, but necessary for a happy life while you pursue FIRE. Our lifestyle never inflated faster than our income but I did buy a second and then third boat (not at once, upgraded boats). Boating is a lifestyle I enjoy and was willing to pay for that experience. When I bought cars they were new cars but we also kept them for a minimum of 10 years and only financed at 0% interest, otherwise we paid cash. I still drive a 2003 Infiniti G35. We also enjoy fine dining and spent much more than average on that.

Our savings rate was consistently between 25-30% of gross income so not massive by some measures on this sub but not shabby either.

**Planning for FIRE**

The plan was lifestyle heavy meaning that we planned for what to do during retirement as much as we planned the financial side of things. One part of the plan that didn’t work out was our business venture. Well, it did kind of work out but not in the way we thought it would.

In 2012 I opened a franchise business that was intended to be our “passive” income during retirement. We had grand plans to open multiple locations and operate them remotely. Having been in the business for five years I do know some owners who successfully operate multiple locations in different parts of the country.

Long story short, the business was not easy or passive and we sold it in 2017. The good news is that with the profits we were able to accelerate our FIRE plan by a couple of years. So we bought our fourth home (first rental property, second rental property, primary residence, and now fourth rental that would become a home).
Our plan was to live half the year at our first rental property and the other half at our latest property in CA. The other two properties, our primary residence and one CA rental would be sold. 

The way things actually worked was that we sold our primary residence, we’re selling the first rental, keeping the CA rental and keeping the CA house. We have one mortgage that we can pay off any time we want but with interest rates so low we’re keeping the mortgage for now.

My wife continues to work because she enjoys it, not because she has to. She is able to work from anywhere giving us the ability to live where we want.

**The Retirement Reality**

We pinch ourselves and ask how is this possible on a daily basis. During the winter months we live in a gated community in southern CA with the most stunning mountain views you could ask for and we live at the beach with an awesome boat and waverunner to enjoy on a daily basis in the summer months. We’re members at and play tennis where the largest non-major tennis tournament is held in Indian Wells.

I’ve lost 40 pounds and compete in half marathons and now triathlons. We are by far, the fittest we’ve ever been and plan on getting even better. My wife has placed first and third in her age group in the last two races she’s run.

We made friends at our CA house long before retiring so when me moved here this season, it was like going home to friends and family. We have not been bored for one second yet. As a matter of fact, I haven’t even had time to read a book yet.

The one observation I’ll make is that there are no wrong decisions. For example, I only have about 3-4k in a Roth IRA, basically nothing. I never obsessed over it or worried about it. Whether your portfolio is in the right investment or you are perfectly optimized for taxes doesn’t matter. What matters is that you have enough to cover your expenses regardless of where that comes from.
I hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoy reading other’s stories.",financialindependence

There is nothing wrong with work, when work must be done. And there is no question that an elite obsession with meaningful work will produce a handful of winners who hit the workist lottery: busy, rich, and deeply fulfilled. But a culture that funnels its dreams of self-actualization into salaried jobs is setting itself up for collective anxiety, mass disappointment, and [inevitable burnout](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work).

&#x200B;

\* \* \*   


There is something slyly dystopian about an economic system that has convinced the most indebted generation in American history to put “purpose over paycheck.” Indeed, if you were designing a *Black Mirror* labor force that encouraged overwork without higher wages, what might you do? Perhaps you’d persuade educated young people that income comes second; that no job is just a job; and that the only real reward from work is the ineffable glow of purpose. It is a diabolical game that creates a prize so tantalizing yet rare that almost nobody wins, but everybody feels obligated to play forever.

Not entirely sober at this point, so I'll keep it simple.

51/M/5'11""/175lbs ... no, wait, wrong subreddit.

I'm 51, just hit earliest unreduced pension after 30 years of full-time work.  My wife and I have been living on that pension amount for years now.  The rest of my salary, and her half-year salary, and our rental income have all gone to paying off our four rental properties - which we did a year ago.

I liked my job (IT) well enough, but it was stressful (IT).  My wife asked me for a few months why I was working that stressful job for money we clearly didn't need. That is, if we were financially independent, and my job was hurting me at least as much as it made me feel good, why was I working for someone else?  Finally, I had no good answer.

So my life and time are now my own and we have more money available than we have been used to living on, and now we have the time to use it.  So, now what?  That's \_not\_ a desperate cry for help to you all - rather just a bright-eyed head-shake of question to myself.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (with home/land). Our actual withdrawal rate is much less than the original 3% of portfolio due to: occasionally earning additional passive income; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (below). The budgeted maximum withdrawal amount for 2021 is $3,904/mo or $46,858/yr (now 2% of net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We’re so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an ebay business while in college ($10k), and student loans ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average. My parents initially promised to cover the student loans out of what they deemed to be principle, but we assumed them when purchasing their home/farm in 2019 ($380k + assumption of student loans + free rent for life, for an estimated $750k home/farm that is now probably closer to $900k).

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was initially 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents’ home/farm, our net worth is closer to 50% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another house with 66 acres) / 50% VTSAX (total US stock market). We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment, social security, other inheritances, universal health care, or universal basic income. The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**2020 RECAP**

**Spending**: Living expenses for 2020 came to $39,458 (max budget $41,736). We generated $8,045 of income this year from some almost entirely passive stuff. Our investment withdrawal was $31,413 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.51% for the year (max budget 2%). Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 1.89% for the year. Spending guideline for 2021 will be $46,858 (2% of net worth). Our net worth has gone from $1,333,772 (start) to $2,342,926 (current). Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out, got all of it back, and padded the portfolio even further. The New York Times reached out to me again in March to see if I was financially ruined, but I had to disappoint them.

**Experiences**: I ran nearly 2000 miles after my competitive running career came to a close (personal records: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). That’s way down from 3000 miles in 2019, but I switched over to cycling (2000 miles) primarily during the summer (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete). I allowed the pandemic and others’ imbecilic denial of reality surrounding the pandemic to make this a less productive year. I mostly stayed home and stuck with existing hobbies (reading, gaming, watching movies, web browsing, vintage card/nintendo collecting, hiking, bird watching, shopping for my parents, following the near demise of our republic). I even reapplied with my old employer and the state volunteer medical core to help with immunizations for the upcoming year, but I am apparently not wanted.

**Upcoming**: In 2021, I want to get vaccinated so that I can return to society, learn to swim effectively without a snorkel, learn to play some basic piano, look into becoming a race director, continue running for my physical/mental health, find some new volunteer opportunities, decrease my time in the digital world, spend more time with existing hobbies, make up for lost traveling (California #3, Hawaii #2, Japan #3), and continue to do whatever the fuck I want.",financialindependence

&#x200B;

This is an update to my post from a year ago, [Journey to FI from an African perspective (27Yr Male)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/99nif7/journey_to_fi_from_an_african_perspective_27yr/).

&#x200B;

I'm 28 now, still living in Lusaka, Zambia... Still male.

&#x200B;

Id like to use this thread as an opportunity to recap on my original plans and summarize on what went well, what didn't, lessons learnt and plans going forward.

&#x200B;

**Quick overview:**

* My goal is to have the option of retiring by 2026 (age 35)
* To live comfortably as a single man I'd need about 5,000 ZMW / $381 per month (1,810,000 ZMW / $138,000 NW)
* To live comfortably as a married man I'd need about 10,400 ZMW / $800 per month (3,800,000 ZMW / $288,000 NW)
* To live comfortably as a married man with kids I'd need about 20,960 ZMW / $1,600 a month (7,545,600 ZMW / $576,000 NW)
* Current take home salary is 32,000 ZMW ($2,500)
* Entitled to tax fee 25% gratuity at end of contract annually (114,000 ZMW / $8, 702)
* For convenience, divide the Kwacha (ZMW) amount by 10 (Though the exchange rate is currently 13.1 to the dollar >\_>)
* My net worth this time last year was 368,000 ZMW or $98,000 in 2016 PPP. This estimate was based on all my assets (land, T-Bills & Savings) at the time
* My current net worth roughly sits at 804,000 ZMW with 304,000 ZMW being in cash and 500,000 ZMW being the (totally not professionally assessed) value of my currently under construction property and the land it sits on.
* Mortgages are not a thing here as they are far too expensive. The norm is to buy property outright or build incrementally.
* Most of my cash will be burned through to complete my 327 sq m (3,519 sq ft) house between October-December 2020. The property is currently at ""roof level""
* I also purchased a 600 sq m (6,458 sq ft) piece of land for a total of 156,000ZMW paid over a period of 12 months.
* I have the intention of completing a second 226 sq m (2,433 sq ft) property in this plot by December 2021.
* My second house will be based on this lovely design, should be considerably cheaper than my first project: [https://betterbuilthomes.com.au/our-homes/single-storey/allira-24/](https://betterbuilthomes.com.au/our-homes/single-storey/allira-24/)
* Still live with le parents, still save 66%+ of my salary

&#x200B;

**Recap: T-Bill investments**

* My original plan was to primarily invest in my countries high yield/risk Treasury Bills on an annual basis. Repeating this pattern YOY (till 2026) & increasing the principle at least 150,000ZMW each time.
* As of last year a 364 day T-Bill had a yield of 18.5% with 20% withholding tax on gains
* As of September 2019 a 364 day T-Bill has a yield of 27.5% with a 20% withholding tax on gains.
* Sounds great till you realize the local currency has slipped over 39% against the dollar in just one year. (9.5 to 13.2 against the dollar)
* I invested 120,000 ZMW ($12,631) in Aug 2018 and received 138,603 ZMW ($10,500) post tax in 2019 :(
* A dollar account, with zero interest, would be worth at least $162,940 today (facepalm).
* Even under these ridiculous conditions, it was still more beneficial to invest in T-Bills than keep the amount in say a (low interest) savings account, as the dollar equivalent would be as little as $9,470.

**Takeways:**

* My local currency is FAR too volatile and cannot be used to hold value for at least the next 5 years. Shame too as the early 2000s were the ""boom"" years, the Kwacha was 3.5 ZMW against the dollar at its peak. Around 2014 the exchange rate was around 6 ZMW to a dollar. The currency has taken a battering thanks to the current regimes excessive debt and general corruption/wastefulness/shortsightedness.
* Elections in 2021. Euro-bond payments due in 2022. Poor rainfall / climate change wreaking havoc with hydro-power. Good times ahead XD
* In the interim I will invest in hard assets (property), maintain value in a USD account and eventually invest in US stocks/ETFs.
* I will only be able to invest in US stocks/ETFs after I have completed my second home in 2020.

&#x200B;

**Recap: Property investments**

* While the currency has slid against the dollar, the price of building materials has gotten cheaper.
* I'm completing my first house this year. (installing a concrete tile roof, wiring, plumbing, aluminum windows, other finishing + tiles etc)
* The average 3 bed-roomed house in good parts of the city sell for anywhere between 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 ZMW. Rent is anywhere from 6,000 ZMW to 8,500 ZMW per month.
* My house is quite large with a total of 4 bedrooms (3 of which are self contained) and a ridiculous living-room/kitchen.
* When complete, and assessed by a professional, the property should be worth well over 1,300,000 ZMW / $99,200.
* I (currently) have no intention of flipping. I'm primarily interested in using the property as collateral to access cheap loans to fund other investments (12% annual interest at a cooperative, much lower than any commercial banks offerings).
* I have yet to decide if I will live in this house or rent it out (single). Renting makes the most sense though as its far too large for one person (pics below).
* As mentioned above, I've also purchased a second piece of land for 150,000 ZMW / $11,450. To be paid over 12 months at which point Ill have enough savings to build up the property to at least roof level.

**Takeaways:**

* Real estate is a safe heaven and a good way of both maintaining and gaining value over time.
* This wont change anytime soon as Lusaka is one of the fastest growing cities in Africa.
* Last I checked we have a housing shortage of at least 2 million units.
* The value of the house will be used to acquire cheap loans from my cooperative. This money will be used to invest in either more property or other opportunities.
* I hope to purchase/construct at least 1 new house every 2 years from now till around 2026.
* As I get older and earn more money,  I should be able to accelerate this process.
* It would be great to have >= 10 properties in total by the time I'm 40

&#x200B;

**Recap: Other advice, remote work, emigration**

* Since I'm a Software Engineer, I was advised by several members on this forum to consider either (a) doing remote work or (b) emigrating
* Shortly after seeing these comments I signed up to Upwork and got a job on my first bid!! Shortly after that I got a 3 month contract with a US based firm.
* This was a great experience, I learned a lot and earned a good amount of money despite putting <10 hours a week on average.
* However, my day job is extremely demanding and by December 2018 I was completely burnt out.
* Parted ways with the US firm and have never used Upwork since. I simply don't have the bandwidth to work two jobs right now
* I have recently interviewed with a local organization which would offer tax free salary of $55,000 a year (fingers crossed)
* As for emigration, I have interviewed with companies based in: The US, Sweden, South Africa, Germany, Singapore and Dubai.
* All of these interviews are the result of recruiters approaching me on LinkedIn (working on a cool project with my current employer, must definitely help)
* Ive gotten much better at the interviews and exercises, and do feel I should be able to get an offer in the near future.
* For certain roles, I got as far as interviewing with the CTO >\_>
* That said I still base my budget and plans on the assumption that Ill still be based in Zambia for the next few years.

**Takeaways:**

* Keep applying myself and doing exceptional work with current employer.
* Keep refining my skills in my niche (React/SpringBoot/Kotlin/PostgreSQL).
* Be ready for any opportunities which may arise.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Local currency has gone to hell, local T-Bills cancelled until further notice
* Still doubled my net worth despite dismal economic performance (probably tripled after professional assessment (which will be dollar based))
* Completing first property this year
* Planning on completing second property by 2020
* Want to average at least 1 new property every 2 years till 2026
* Hard assets, dollar accounts and dollar investments are-in

776,"UPDATE: Hidden Taxes! We pay 6.34% in Federal Income Tax, but we still pay another 13.78% in State Income Tax, FICA Payroll Tax, Property Tax, and Sales Tax.",,998,dfhpdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dfhpdb/update_hidden_taxes_we_pay_634_in_federal_income/,1570630814.0,"Over the weekend I  made this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddqua0/we\_make\_150kyear\_yet\_our\_effective\_federal\_tax/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddqua0/we_make_150kyear_yet_our_effective_federal_tax/)

Initially I was pleasantly surprised to find out that our Effective Federal Income Tax Rate on $150,000 of income was only 6.34%. My wife and I both max our Traditional 401(k)s and HSAs to help reduce our federal tax burden. I always assumed we paid closer to 20% in taxes (which is the assumption in my FIRE spreadsheet), so this was good news! This would means that our FIRE date would potentially move up by a couple years!

But then a few members of this fantastic community pointed out that I shouldn't forget things like the 7.65% FICA payroll tax, our state's income tax, property tax, and even sales tax.

This encouraged me to try and calculate the TOTAL amount of ALL taxes that we pay in a given year. Below is a breakout of each major type.

|Tax Type|Amount|%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Income Tax|$9,504|31.5%|
|State Income Tax|$8,740|29.0%|
|City Income Tax|$0|0.0%|
|FICA Payroll Tax|$10,939|36.2%|
|Property Tax|$314|1.0%|
|Sales Tax|$650|2.2%|
|Car Tag Tax|$40|0.1%|
|**TOTAL TAXES PAID**|**$30,187**|**100.0%**|

I was then very surprised  to find out that our federal income taxes accounted for a much smaller amount of our total tax burden than I would have originally thought!

**Our Total Effective Tax Rate ended up being 20.12%** ($30,187/$150,000). Which is actually SLIGHTLY HIGHER than my FIRE spreadsheet assumption of 20.0%!

I figured this would be a helpful finding to share with the community because some of the ""smaller"" taxes we pay (like state, city, FICA, property, and sales taxes) can really add up and potentially have a big effect on our FIRE calculations.

**EDIT:** As a few of you have pointed out, in retirement taxes should be a bit lower (No FICA payroll taxes, untaxed Roth withdrawals, and lower income taxes for dividend and long-term capital gains in taxable account. So to get an accurate tax number for your FIRE spreadsheet, you would want to account for those changes.",financialindependence

I think it's not a realistic position if you want to maintain relationships with people you grew up with if you're from a low income background. 

I'm from a very low income background (daughter of migrant farm workers) as is my husband. We each come from families where we each have 30+ cousins and are very close with our extended families. My husband salary is quite obviously high, as he is a nurse in a top hospital. I'm in a job position that many people are familiar with but don't actually know can earn quite a bit of money, so I'm able to hide my salary more. 

So, if you come from a very tight knit community, how do you deal with the wealth gap? Do you encounter a lot of guilt when your family and friends are suffering? I always wish that I could help everyone, but I also don't want to fall into the trap and become poor again myself. My husband and I both agreed that we would pay off our parents mortgages. This then helps our siblings too, because if anyone is ever struggling or homeless, they have a place to stay without a steep mortgage. 

But then I have my friends. The community I was raised in had very strict values, similar to the ""snitches get stitches"" mentality, where you shouldn't be doing well if you're friends are struggling. How do you deal with this type of guilt? I'm a woman of color btw, so this mentality has saved my own family many times and I feel bad turning my back on it",financialindependence

Now she is dying and broke with medical care expenses eating up all her savings.   Now it is her families responsibility to pay the bills.  My sisters want to keep her alive another day \(and anther day after that.\) with very expensive medical procedures.   I say let her go.  They call me a killer.

Anyone else face a huge hit to their financial independence in retirement due to huge medical costs of their parents?  How do you decide if you want to spend the money to keep Mom alive just one more day, even if she is suffering?

We don't know what Mom would want because she is out of it.  No directives.

Everyone in the family has spent tens of thousands to keep her alive during the last year.  The amount Medicare does not pay is incredibly high in the very complex surgeries they say she needs to live another day or week, but the hospital wants to keep her alive because it makes them rich.",financialindependence

Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month ($30k per year) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3% withdrawal rate is below the 100% historically safe mark of 3.2% for fifty-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20% above the original target amount (meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5% instead of 3% if restarting from the peak); and our actual withdrawal rate has averaged less than 2% of the original portfolio balance thus far due to earning additional income. The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 ($2618 adjusted for inflation).

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70%.

**Background**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.



***UPDATED INFO***

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month came to $4628. This is $1855 over the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 66.9% over budget for the month, 15.6% over for the year, and 18.4% over since retirement. We generated $30,804 of income this month from my wife wanting to work, some of my old book royalties, and an unexpected inheritance. Our investment withdrawal was -$26,176 this month (a $26,176 deposit), thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate is -28.32% for the month, -10.03% for the year, and -0.15% since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 5.01% for the month, 3.47% for the year, and 3.55% since retirement.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,117,315 to $1,103,975 (a 1.19% decrease for the month), which went up to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,130,151 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is a 10.18% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals of $16,977 for living expenses over ten months. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $52.24/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $17.95/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $-7.98/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate. Ignoring possible dividends, VTSAX (61% AA) went down 2.3% this month (1.0% down for the year); VFWAX (20% AA) went down 1.0% (0.8% down for the year); VWLUX (19% AA) went up 0.2% (down 2.3% for the year).

**Reflections**: I do not wish to get into details of the $30k inheritance that we received. I will only say that it was not expected, not from a death, and the person was well aware of our financial status (likely carried out due to perceived fairness and equality for all parties involved). Our receiving of that much money in a lump sum also comes close to invalidating the documentation behind the whole reason for this process. Spending was up due to dental work ($1000), vacation reservations ($500), and a decision to go crazy by blowing 3% of the inheritance ($1000). We bought a camera, running shoes, two race entries, two album reissues, and some clothes. The remaining 97% went straight to VWLUX. I almost feel guilty.

**Experiences**: I put 61 hours into Final Fantasy XV over seven days, finishing the game and most of the side quests. I think it was fairly average by series standards. My marathon training peaked at 40mpw and is now tapering. I spent way too much time following recent political developments.

**Upcoming**: The marathon state championship is April 7. I was poised to take the victory (based on the winning time in 2016 and 2017), but some guy who is on a mission to win 100 marathons is driving eight hours to do this one. His reputation in the running community couldn’t possibly be any lower. He has a history of cherry picking small races nowhere near his home in order to get his numbers up. At some point this month, we’ll be taking a driving vacation across flyover country to visit the states that my wife has not yet been to. This will bring her up to my current count of 49. I’ll be trying for a victory in another local race on May 5. Afterwards, I plan on cutting back on running while I get some more experience with bicycling and swimming. Needless to say, I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

780,My one year FIRE update. Hint: It's awesome.,,997,d1r1rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/d1r1rt/my_one_year_fire_update_hint_its_awesome/,1568036437.0,"Six month update can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ayen19/my_first_six_months_of_fire/

TLDR: I FIREd one year ago and man, has this year gone by quickly. The plan worked and while it’s been a wonderful time I did have some surprises along the way.

**A Brief Recap**

I’m not using a throwaway account and my identity is easy to discover so I won’t be using any actual figures. Suffice to say I’m on the fat side of FIRE but by most definitions, it’s pretty low on the Fat scale.

I had a 25 year career in television news in NYC. My income was higher than average but in no way close to some of the software engineers or doctors on this sub. In my six month update someone guessed my income was 200k and another person suggested it was 500-600k. I never got close to 200k and neither did my wife. 

The original plan was that my wife and I would retire at the same time but since she likes her job and can do it from anywhere, she continues to work. At any time she can decide to stop working and the plan stays the same.

Major events in our lives that helped us FIRE started with a literal fire. In 1997 my wife’s house burned down and we were able to turn tragedy into triumph by investing the insurance money as we rebuilt the house. I have two rental properties. I’m trying to sell one at the NJ shore now but there isn’t really demand for three unit rentals. Oversized single family homes, however, are selling for ridiculous prices.

Although frowned upon (or worse) on this sub we have owned a timeshare for 20 years and loved it while working. It’s been even better now that we can travel more. Went to Utah in April and are planning to go to Arizona in November and Colorado in January or February. In Oct. of 2020 we’re going to Hawaii.

**Labor Day**

This had a lot of significance for me through the years. When I was a kid it meant going back to school after spending the summer at my parent’s vacation home / rental property at the Jersey Shore. As an adult it meant that the long weekends I’d take were over and it was back to a regular schedule. Now that I live here at the Jersey Shore for six months, it means I watch all my friends do those things and I enjoy the weather, the boat, Waverunner, paddle boarding, and running on the boardwalk without any of the crowds that were here in the summer. Labor day used to be an end to something now it’s the beginning of something new as I prepare to go back to CA for six months.

**First Year Observations**

I wanted this year to be a test for what life will be like going forward. We wanted to watch our spending carefully and live as frugally as possible just to make sure we had everything right. I avoided big ticket items. The golf cart that came with the house we bought in CA needed to have all the batteries replaced at a cost of around $900 or we needed to buy a replacement golf cart, probably $3,500. When I was working it would have been an easy decision – buy a new one. I did nothing and will decide what to do when I return to CA next month. Since our spending was good, I’m leaning toward a new one but some big expenses are coming up. One of the air conditioning units broke at our house in CA but rather than fix it, I’m also waiting until we return in October.

My rental in CA is going well and my excellent tenant wants to stay another year. He did ask for some big ticket items like having a retractable awning installed on the patio and replacing the curtains with blinds or shutters. I’ll probably add the awning since it will increase the property value but not the window treatments.

The biggest surprise for me was that our eating out budget was way more than I thought it would be and not in the place I thought. I figured we’d go out to eat a lot more when we’re living in CA since we have lots more retired friends there. It turns out we just have dinner at different friend’s houses. In NJ since our kitchen is small and family and friends visit on the weekends, we’ve gone out a lot more than expected. It won’t break the budget but it was surprising. I’m surprised how much we spend at our local microbreweries but that’s where we hang out with most of our friends so it’s money well spent – and the beer rocks.

**Lifestyle inflation**

In my 6 month update I mentioned that I believe that some lifestyle inflation is not only inevitable, but necessary for a happy life while you pursue FIRE. My biggest lifestyle splurge was my boat. I thoroughly enjoy it and was willing to pay for that experience. Unfortunately after only four years my boat had a major engine issue that would have cost $10,000 to fix but luckily it was under warranty. Now I’m looking at new boats – we’ll see if that’s in the budget. 

**Getting FIRE Right**

My key takeaway after a year out of work is that perfect planning and perfect execution are impossible. I split my time between the two highest tax states – that definitely wasn’t perfect planning. The good news is that you can be pretty far from perfect but still succeed. I've literally had people on this sub call me an idiot or stupid for things I’ve done. For instance I’m not an advocate of maxing 401k or IRA at the expense of not investing in a taxable account. I never maxed those accounts myself. Now that I’m retired I don’t have to worry about a 72t, I just withdraw from my taxable brokerage. I use a version of the three bucket method and was told it’s just a mind trick and doesn’t really do anything for you. That’s fine but it’s a mind trick that works for me – no need for perfection just success.

**The Retirement Reality**

We pinch ourselves and ask “how is this possible” on a daily basis. During the winter months we live in a gated community in southern CA with the most [stunning mountain views](https://i.imgur.com/JVlmHza.jpg) you could ask for and we live at the beach with an awesome boat and waverunner to enjoy on a daily basis in the summer months. I had [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/Tq5rPLN.jpg) hanging in my office when I was working and now this is my life. It was definitely worth it. We’re members at and play tennis where the largest non-major tennis tournament is held in Indian Wells. Here’s [Roger Federer practicing.](https://i.imgur.com/MbYxOpM.jpg)

I was surprised that I didn’t do nearly as much hiking as I thought I would and I plan on changing that once we get back to CA. 

In my previous update I said that I’d lost 40 pounds and compete in half marathons and now triathlons. Well, I came in second place in my age group at a trail half marathon in Utah and my wife came in first in her age group at the same race. 

I had a crazy mishap at what would have been my second triathlon this summer. I got chemical burns to both my corneas from the anti-fog spray I used on my goggles. I was basically blind for two days and it took over a week for my eyesight to return to normal. I’ve already signed up to do that tri again next year, not letting anything keep me down.

Another six months past and we have not been bored for one second. As a matter of fact, I haven’t even had time to read a book (though I am writing another one).

We’re just taking things as they come and enjoying life.",financialindependence

Luckily, I found Mr. Money Mustache, this sub, and YMYL and have been absorbing as much knowledge about FI/RE as possible, and I've changed my whole plan after some life-changing evenings by myself with some wine and spreadsheets (romance is alive and well). I've realized that **those things I wanted aren't going to make me happy**. So my lifestyle plan has changed drastically:

I have a cheap, practical car; I'm going to keep it. 
My job has no dress code and my clothes are good quality; I'll keep wearing the ones I have to work and everywhere else.
I have a nice commuter bike already; I'm going to live close to work and commute on a bike.
I'm very happy with the lifestyle I've had in college; I'm going to keep living frugally and socially.

And above all, I'm going to avoid debt, save as much as possible, invest in real estate and build side-hustles, and be on track to retire at a nearly-fatFIRE level by age 40 at the latest, by my excel calculations.

Even better, I hesitantly brought it up to my girlfriend and she was so happy she almost cried - turns out she's secretly big into Stoicism, and she wants to retire early and travel and bike and not own a clothes dryer. Biggest relationship boost ever!

I'm so glad this community and the critical mass of knowledge is here and on the blogosphere. **You've saved me 20 years of unnecessary working before I even start my career!** Seriously. Twenty.

784,An attempt at the FIRE flow chart,,991,dhr5kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dhr5kp/an_attempt_at_the_fire_flow_chart/,1571062513.0,"Last week, I was playing around with the idea of making a flow chart that would be more in tuned with the FI community.

I thought I would ask for help from the community. 

I currently have [version 1.3](https://imgur.com/a/MXKlxKa) and would be open to any suggestions and improvements.

I FIREd last year at 45.

Ha! That whole ""what happens if you retire at the height of the great depression?""

I may be testing that.

However currently things are actually good. Its been a quiet year for me on the home font. 

Since I am FI already I'm not stressed about not going in to work or trying to work from home or hoping not to get laid off.  My checking and saving have enough to get me though for quite a while. 

I have basically been on my own ""social isolation"" for a year. Its hard to have a social life when all your friends and ex- coworkers are busy with employment!  I was catching up with all the new release moves until the shutdown. 

I have finally been able to catch up on a bunch of the games I neglected over the past few years. My biggest ""splurge"" was building a new PC to play the modern games.  I enjoyed ""The Outer Worlds"" and Fallout 4 has been great. Epic has been giving away games weekly so I have a bunch in my library I haven't even had a chance to try. 

My health has actually dramatically improved since I no longer have to deal with the stresses of my old job. I am able to cook at home and not not eat out as much.  I lost a bunch of weight and all my vital stats are back in the green!  Still plenty of room to improve.  I was getting out and doing some exercise before Covid. That has died down and I really should get back to walking a bit more, even if I need to wear a mask. 

My net worth has taken a bit of a hit but I still have enough ""slack"" in my budget that I'm not stressing. I even picked up a little stock that I feel will do well in the next couple of years. I'm not going hog wild but I'm betting on an eventual recovery even if it takes a while. I have some time. 

My main yearly worry is heath insurance and how to deal with it. Since I can control my conversion from my 401k/ira into my Roth I can have enough ""income"" to qualify for ACA. That's my current plan until we finally fix the heath care system in this country. 

So all in all its not a super exciting update, but if you are working on FIRE, or just FI, I can say it is worth it!",financialindependence

788,"Swedish FIRE Journey -- 19 years worth of data on how to study, work and invest in a high-tax country, graphs inside",,975,eqfzxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eqfzxl/swedish_fire_journey_19_years_worth_of_data_on/,1579351664.0,"Hi all,

This sub consists of many interesting high-income US FIRE examples, so I thought I might as well chip in with my own story -- showing that it is possible to work and save comfortably in a relatively high-tax country, Sweden.

This is an update of my previous post on the same topic,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/738cjl/journey\_towards\_fire\_sweden\_17\_years\_studying/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/738cjl/journey_towards_fire_sweden_17_years_studying/)  . 38M, engineer, Sweden.

After a decent 2018 and a mind-blowing 2019, things look good. Still in tech, similar salary as before ($77k-isch before tax), but quite large NW improvement. My current NW now sits at around $641k after-tax, or around $946k if retirement accounts are included.

I have tracked my finances since around 2001, so I can now see rather clearly what the market behaves like in good years and in volatile bad years. I still rent, as price levels in my town are not attractive relative the rent-controlled apartment I live in. I have a light leverage on my investments, and my savings rate has crept up to somewhere around 45%, potentially 50% with some luck.

Target NW is $1M. At a 3% net WR, this would give me enough money to spend -- $30 000 net/yr would last a long time here, especially as there is a cap on out of pocket health care expenses at around $150/yr for hospital visits and $300/yr for medicines. I would be close to that point today, if I would count my retirement accounts -- but they are not accessible for another 16-22 years or so, and it would be nice to reach FI \_excluding\_ the retirement accounts, for extra safety (for example to take pessimistic future tax scenarios into account). $1M is also a nice round number and should be a good enough pot of money, should I decide to move elsewhere.

So, have a look at some graphs for 19 years worth of studying, working and investing:

Graph 1: [Income vs expenses, 2001 to 2020.](https://i.imgur.com/xFm1zHV.png)

Graph 2: [Net worth (assets + debt), monthly, 2001 to jan 2020, with comments on market events etc.](https://i.imgur.com/eNyfjrH.png)

Graph 3: [Net worth including retirement accounts, yearly, 2001 to 2019.](https://i.imgur.com/xzc1RP7.png)

Graph 4: [Forecast of net worth from graph 2, 10 years ahead at different return rates.](https://i.imgur.com/XdZFHq7.png)

Nobody knows what will happen in the future of course, with elevated CAPE10 levels and some of the usual geopolitical unrest -- but I am still confident that regular investing will continue to be successful over the coming 10-20 years, even if we would get some kind of ""market correction"" going forward.

EDIT: Adding some EU/Sweden-specific differences to distinguish this post from other ""NW increases, yay"" posts in the sub.

Very generally, direct income tax rates and capital gains tax rates / dividend tax rates are much higher in for example Sweden, while salaries for professionals are usually quite a bit lower. I could potentially have a salary in the range $100k-$250k in the US with my current line of work, while aso having a higher net income after tax. 

This means that your after-tax capacity for large savings is much smaller than it otherwhise would be. For many people, this is absolutely fine -- you can live a comfortable life and rely on the government-funded pension and occupational pension plans (which I include the value of in ""graph 3"").

Given that the cost of living is often relatively high, and that tax rates on higher income is also relatively high, that means that after-tax savings are quite rare and most people seem to rely on property investments (using heavy leverage) rather than savings in the stock market.

However. Once you start contributing to after-tax savings accounts, such as the tax-advantaged ""ISK"" in Sweden, you will see exactly the same benefits as if investing in a Roth IRA in the US (although with a low yearly tax). So the key here is as always to keep expenses a fair bit lower than income.  

A special case for Sweden here is that while many expenses are higher, rental apartments have rent control. I live on 78 sqm / 840 sq ft, more than enough for myself, at a cost of about $680/month. This is one example of where the system is different from the US. The big downside of this is of course that this limits housing supply a lot, meaning that we have large queues in many (most) urban areas. 

The other really major difference is that the high tax rates come with social insurance schemes for sickness and unemployment, meaning that there is little need for a large emergency fund. I keep 3 months emergency savings for this purpose, but would get approx 80% of my current salary if unemployed or sick for a considerable amount of time (and I would still be able to save substantially on those 80%). And the big kicker is of course health insurance, where my out of pocket payment is capped at around $450 for \_both\_ medicines and hospital visits. This makes your future expense level much more predictable than what would otherwise be the case. It means that my target expense level of $30 000/year is quite safe.",financialindependence

It took some effort though. I first contacted my benefits department to ask. After several emails back and forth I was basically told ‘the only after tax contributions you can do is for Roth, we can change your contributions to that if you would like, have a nice day’. 

I was pretty certain they hadn’t dealt with this before and weren’t aware of the 2019 401k/403b limit of 56,000 (they kept telling me that the limit was 19,000 and were confused when I said ‘after tax NON Roth). At this point I felt it would be better to contact the plan provider directly.  They understood what I wanted to do after a little explaining, even though they also said they had never heard of this before. ‘You said this was called a Mega Backdoor Roth?’ they asked. ‘We’ll do some research and let you know if we can allow this. We’ll follow up with email later’.

I got an email a day later saying that my issue had been resolved, but no details were in it. I called again, and had the rep look up my case. ‘It looks like they approved this...mega backdoor Roth? I’ve never heard of that (it was a new rep). But contact your local rep where you work to get the form to do this’.

It took making an appointment with the rep to get the paperwork since they didn’t have it through the website, which took another week, but just today I got it. This has been a long process, but it was helpful remembering stories here on r/financialindependence. In the past I am pretty sure that I would have quit early on, probably at the first step when I was told ‘you can only put in 19,000, have a nice day’.  But I know I’m not the first one here who ran into what seemed like a brick wall and then found a way, which was hugely motivating. And now I have a way to get much much more into tax advantaged buckets, which will get me to FI that much sooner. Always just ask and keep asking.

793,Algorithm I used to set my 3.25% SWR (from a retired guy),,972,alf50o,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/alf50o/algorithm_i_used_to_set_my_325_swr_from_a_retired/,1548869781.0,"The 4% rule-of-thumb is a great starting point for setting a SWR for someone retiring at a traditional retirement age. But as many people in the community have stated, it makes less sense if you're planning for an extended retirement.

Here's how I've calculated my SWR:

1. Start at 3%
2. For each 5% you’re willing to lower your spending when your portfolio falls below it's original value, increase your SWR by 0.25%
3. Take into account current valuations based on CAPE ratio  
\-- CAPE >30: subtract 0.25%  
\-- 25<CAPE<30: leave alone  
\-- 20<CAPE<25: add 0.25%  
\-- CAPE<20: add 0.5%
4. Accounting for willingness and ability to return to work for an extended period if necessary  
\--Very unwilling: leave alone  
\-- Reluctantly willing: add 0.25%  
\-- Very willing: add 0.5%
5. If you are very risk averse, subtract 0.25% so you sleep better at night

Reasoning:

* Looked at a 50 year retirement timeline with a 70/20/10 stock/bond/cash split
* [Generally, for each 5% you increase your spending flexibility, you can increase your spending by 0.25% while keeping your odds of going broke <10%](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/?spend=40000&initsav=1000000&age=35&yrs=50&stockpct=70&bondpct=20&cashpct=10&sex=0&infl=1&taxrate=10&fees=0.3&income=0&incstart=50&incend=70&expense=0&expstart=50&expend=70&showdeath=0&showlow=1&show2x=1&show5x=1&flexpct=20)
* [CAPE ratio has been a pretty good predictor of long term equity performance, SWR success rates](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/12/21/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-3-equity-valuation/)

I’m earning $115k, SR 16% and my 401k just hit $50k. 

I’ve got about $400k in home equity and could really afford to save more but I think I’ve got decent balance right now. 

That is all!

Edit :

Hey, since this one is getting more attention than I thought it would and to give some more detail :

I am 37 and live in a HCOL area.

I make $115k and my wife makes $75k. We have one child. I work in aerospace manufacturing.

We have a house and a condo with combined equity at this point of about $400k. 
This equity came from selling our first house, putting all equity ($125k) into the new house plus some savings. 

Condo was purchased with 20% cash down and we carry a mortgage but values around here have been going up at a staggering clip (PNW).

My SR is 16% - 10% 401K and 6% discount stock.
I get a 3% match from my company on the 401K and 15% off market pricing on company stock. 

Company is a Fortune 500 manufacturer and is well diversified as far as what industries they serve.
Should my contribution to my discount stock be higher? Probably.

My SR could be higher but I am comfortable, we are able to do what we want when we want and I don't feel that I'm being irresponsible at my current SR. 

I'm a victim of lifestyle creep for sure so I've been making a conscious effort to reign that in.

Let me know if you have any more questions - I'll try to answer everyone and thank you for the feedback!

Extreme saving to build up capital equaling 25x your expenses is one way to achieve FIRE. 
Retirement, in the traditional sense of retiring to a life of no particular work responsibilities is one type of retirement. 
BaristaFIREing to a quiet life of easy work is another option. 

All of these things have names. But all of these things are merely arbitrary points on a spectrum of infinite possibilities. Life isn't a forking path, with traditional FIRE going one way, with baristaFIRE pointing in the other direction, and no middle ground between them. You're ""allowed"" to retire to a life based on the 6% rule, with baristafire as a backup. You're allowed to become financially independent and never quit your job if you don't feel like it. You're allowed to retire at 32 fully FI, get bored, start a pottery studio, live off the income from the pottery studio for a while, get bored, close it down, then get a job with the county government cutting down trees. Life is too short to limit your choices to the default options on a forum. 

I think everyone here is aware of this, on some level. But, really  often on this sub, I see people falling into the easy ruts, like treating the 4% rule as an actual rule. Or, they let the easily defined concepts, like coastFIRE, define their goals, when it's pretty clear based on reading their writing that their real goal should be in the Grey Area Of FIRE That Has No Name Yet. Grey Area Fire That Has No Name Yet is perfectly fine.  

Don't let mental frameworks define your path -- let your honest assessment of the life you want to live define your path, and let the rough concepts and frameworks serve their purpose: giving people a starting point for conversations.",financialindependence

I thought I would share my story since I enjoy hearing how other people are doing on their path to FIRE. I have laid it out effectively in terms of school years since I still think in those terms. I only discovered FIRE in the last three years so I also don’t know my net worth for most years but have included estimates that are likely close.

**College and background**

I grew up in a low income household and felt very poor. Ended up at a highly selective liberal arts school. Their financial aid was pretty great at first but fell off a bit. I remember paying only $4,000 for my first year. This jumped to about $10,000 per year for the next three years. Not bad for the experience though. I had only saved a few thousand for college and I wasn’t excited about the prospect of debt, so I worked during school. 25-30 hours a week generally. On top of a very difficult course load (40-60 hours a week on coursework) I ended up feeling very tired and stressed. Looking back I regret working so much. I didn’t even make that much money really.

I studied Physics. A friend of mine tried to get me to take Economics, but it never fit my schedule. I tried to take a Computer Science course, but I couldn’t take it due to demand. I regret both of these things.

**Year 1 (June 2012):**

**Salary $52,000 Cash $12,000 Debt $17,000 NW $-5,000**

While I had always wanted to get a Doctorate, I became disillusioned with the post graduate school job market and decided to enter industry instead. I started working at a small manufacturing company as a Physicist/Manufacturing Engineer. It turns out there are not a lot of options to pursue as a physicist. I didn’t know what I was doing but at least there wasn’t too much pressure on me. Moved to a MCOL area.

Paid off my debts in several months thanks to dirt cheap living expenses (<$1000/month). This was thanks to $400/month rent due to sharing a house with four other people in a not great part of town. I didn’t really track my net worth. I just deposited money in my checking account and tried not to spend too much. I think I put around 8% in my 401k. Looking back, I should have maxed it.

**Year 2:**

**Salary $57,000 NW $20,000?**

Not much to report here. Just worked. Started graduate school part time in Mechanical Engineering. I felt a lack of options with only a Physics degree and felt I would have more options with an MSME. Probably a great choice especially since my work paid for it. I also initially enjoyed classes.

**Year 3:**

**Salary $63,000 NW $50,000?**

I bought the house that I was renting. I probably overpaid for it, but I rented out rooms so it more than paid the mortgage. I guess I was house hacking. It really was about doing something with the money that was just accumulating in my savings account. Investing was scary to me. I borrowed $25,000 from my mother to help me cover the deposit and avoid PMI. I agreed to pay her back over the next 2.5 years.

I also got engaged this year. More on this later. I continued taking classes.

**Year 4:**

**Salary $70,000 NW $100,000?**

I got married! My wife was an artist so didn’t bring in very much money but also was debt free. We kept two renters, but they no longer covered the mortgage. Between a decrease in rent, paying for healthcare for my wife (an extra $400/month), and paying back my mother, things felt very tight. I kept contributing to my 401k though. This brought a fair amount of stress to the relationship. **I highly recommend talking about earning expectations before marriage.** We talked about everything else, but somehow this didn’t come up. I think in part because I was doing fine on my own and didn’t connect the loss of rental income plus increased expenses with marriage. What we did that helped was to budget. This was absolutely critical.

**Year 5:**

**Salary $77,000 NW $140,000?**

This was a big year in many ways. Finished graduate school. Woo! Unfortunately part way through graduate school I realized I didn’t want to be an engineer. I enjoyed the business side of work and should have gotten an MBA.

My wife applied to graduate school as we decided she needed to have a more steady career. We paid off the loan to my mother. The payment was the size of a mortgage, so it felt like we finally had some breathing room.

Perhaps most importantly, this was the year that I discovered FIRE. This was good because I really started disliking my job at some point this year.  **Started maxing my 401k.**

**Year 6:**

**Salary $87,000 NW $175,000?**

I got promoted at work and started managing a team of engineers. I again liked my job though it was more stressful. I also applied to MBA programs. Missed out on top tiers schools (screwing up my Wharton interview is a very sad memory) but got an offer for full tuition at a mid-tier. Thanks to the promotion I decided to do part time grad school again since the company would pay for it. This was painful but probably a good choice.

Started ROTH IRAs for myself and my wife. My wife started graduate school. She worked part time as well. Between part-time work and scholarships, most if not all of the cost was covered.

**Year 7:**

**Salary: $95,000 NW $250,000**

Started grad school. Sold my house and moved to a small 1 BR apartment in a nice part of the city we live in. It was nice to get money out of the house and be able to invest it. I didn’t make a ton from the house sale but it lowered stress. Home ownership, especially for an older home, requires a lot of work.

Started tracking balances every 2 weeks. Felt like this was a good balance of knowing what is happening without getting obsessed.

**Year 8:**

**Salary: $123,000 NW $325,000**

I finished grad school part 2. Wife finished graduate school. I negotiated for a much higher salary at work. Started disliking work again though. Unfortunately covid happened so my wife was furloughed and went to doing gig work. She definitely made some money but it isn’t included in salary here. Started to finally not feel poor as well. That may be silly that it took so long but growing poor leaves marks that take a long time to fade. Something about hitting a significant income level and living in a nicer spot made a big difference.

**Year 8.5 (Present)**

**Salary: $130,000 NW $400,000**

I accepted a job offer in a HCOL/VHCOL city. I will be making less when accounting for cost of living differences, but I think I will enjoy it more and have more growth options (edit: its a technical marketing role). My wife also just started work (another \~$60,000/year). The last time I checked finances we just crossed $400,000, which felt like a big milestone. Hitting six figures in a taxable account just happened as well and this was very exciting.

**My recommendations**:

1. Use a budget. I have had a high savings rate thanks to budgeting.
2. Max out your 401k early (unless it is a terrible fund or something). It will hurt but you can get used to it.
3. Talk about earnings/career expectations before marriage. Create a budget together before getting married.
4. Invest in yourself. Doing part time grad school twice was a good career choice even though it was very difficult. My company paid for it both times.
5. Home ownership can be a great vehicle for wealth building. I found it stressful and detracted from work. Investing in myself and my career will likely end up being a better choice for me. YMMV.

Thanks for reading and for all of the encouragement that this community provides!

Edit: I got a question about NW allocation:

\- Savings: $50K (about to buy a car and move so have been hoarding cash for the last few months)

\- 401K: $185K

\- Roth IRA: $60K

\- Brokerage: $105K

Further edit: target number is $1.25 million. Probably another 12-15 years of work.  


Last edit: A fair number of comments about whether or not I was poor growing up. I grew up in a single-parent family as the youngest of four children. We were below the poverty line until I was at least 12 when a second sibling moved out. I was on free school lunches until it was just me and then I was on reduced school lunches. My mother was a saver who had a full-time job and always took part time gig work as well. So once she was able to save due to her kids moving out, she did. That is why she was able to loan me money at that point (20+ years from when my dad left her). I am sure that plenty of people have worse situations than mine, but I assure you, we were indeed poor when I was young. ",financialindependence
798,"I had a goal of hitting $1M net worth by 30; after a lot of ups and downs, I finally hit it!",,969,890tte,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/890tte/i_had_a_goal_of_hitting_1m_net_worth_by_30_after/,1522687213.0,"I have been following this sub for a very long time (this is not my main reddit account), and since then I have learnt a lot from it. Since I graduated from university, my goal was to hit $1M by the time I was 30.

My biggest learning from this journey so far has been to relax and not worry about where every single dollar is going. I know it sounds sort of counter intuitive, but for me it was causing some stress when an unexpected expense would come. Not because I did not have the money, but because I was not going to hit my savings target for that month. I know everyone is not like me, but I am quite disciplined, so I decided not to track my net worth for ~2.5 years.

Here is a snippet of my journey. 

My family moved to Canada from south asia when I was in my early teens (I think my family came over with less than $15k), and we didn't have much growing up. So I understood what it took to live frugally. Fast forward to when I graduated from highschool, my family was a middle class family in Canada and it was all because of my parents tight handed approach to disposable income.

I graduated at age 23, and I was lucky enough to not have any debt. I had scholarships and worked throughout University and saved up enough from my work terms that I did not need student loans after 2nd year. And I paid the first 2 years off by the time I graduated with money left over.

**Year 1** - I graduated from a STEM discipline and I was lucky enough to get a very good paying job right off the bat. My salary was a hair over six figures when I started. Towards the middle of my first year after graduating, I was able to buy a house (property #1) in the small town I was living in. I started to rent out the basement and a room up top so it would cover my mortgage and I paid for the utilities, repairs and taxes. 

**Year 2** - I had saved up enough to buy make a down payment for a condo in the city I grew up in, at this time I was living extra frugally, and the same old car I bought at the end of university. I ended up buying this condo in one of the hot markets in Canada (property #2). I also got a raise this year, and every subsequent year until Year 7. I also had a side hustle going which was paying for 75% of my living expenses at the time.

**Year 3** - I got a promotion and my company decided to move me, they promised to pay my housing expenses in this new city, so I ended up renting the entire house I had bought and started making a bit of money on it. I continued living frugally, and was saving as much as I could. I stopped the side hustle, since it was affecting my work life balance.

**Year 4** - My company continued paying my expenses and I continued my journey towards FI, but at this point, as discussed I was getting stressed about not hitting my savings goals due to some unexpected expenses. 

**Year 5** - I moved back to the original small town I was living in, and at this time, I had saved enough money, that I decided to buy another rental condo (property #3) in the same hot Canadian market. Two months later, I lost my house (property #1) due to a fire. This was not an easy time for me, and with some back and forth with the insurance company, which took 6 months, they decided to cover all the expenses, and I ended up rebuilding the house. At this point I moved in with my parents and I stopped recording where all my savings were going. To get the rebuild going, since I was having insurance issues, I had to drawdown all my savings and anything that was liquid to the point where I had less than $2.5k in my bank account. I wanted the rebuild done right away for reasons I won’t get into. 

**Year 6** – My house was completely rebuilt and I sold it right after. Took, all the money I got from the house and dumped it back into the stock market (Combination of ETFs and Stocks).

**Year 7** – Due to my division in the company performing poorly, I was packaged out. I knew it was coming (our management sucked), so I was already looking into other companies, and I was unemployed for 2 weeks before I joined my current company. It was a fairly decent package, and the job I found after paid me relatively the same.  

At this time it brings me to today, where I sat down this weekend and went through every account I have to calculate my net worth. I knew I was going to be close to the $1M mark, but I actually did not expect to exceed it. Currently I am sitting at $1.15M, which was very surprising for me, and I had to triple check all my numbers. I lucked out on my properties I bought as rental properties since that local market has done extremely well, so for this calculation I used the govt. assessed values (again I know it is only a paper gain, but I have no plan on selling these properties).

**Here is the breakdown –**

**Cash/Savings Acc**  - $65K (saving for a down payment on a new property, but to live in)

**Stocks/ETFs** – $420K 

**RRSP** – $50K (similar to 401k)

**TFSA** – $60K (similar to Roth)

**Self/Company Contribution (LIRA)** – $115K

**Company Stocks (First company)** – $140K

**Property #2 Equity** – $200K 

**Property #3 Equity** – $100K

I would be lying if I said there was no luck involved and some things played in my favor (like minimal housing expenses).
Future plans, I want to keep on doing what I am doing and save and live semi-frugally. I have always spent on vacations; travelling is very important for me. I finally have a newer new car, and I turn 30 this month. I want to buy a house of my own soon and most likely I will own this house for 20-30 years. 

Please feel free to ask me my questions; I will do my best to answer them.

EDIT 2: Maybe I should have stated from the beginning, which is my fault, but all the numbers are in $CAD.

My situation is not uncommon in my country, my generation has been called the ""1000$ a month generation"" and most of the jobs in here pay around that amount (yes, even for graduated/specialized, some exeptions apply), especially for young people (there is a big gap between old and young people salaries and work rights). For everyone I know, I'm considered in a good position, because at least I got a decent job and I'm not unemployed like many others at my age.

Young americans, please be happy and grateful for what you have. You live in one of the most paying country in the world, and you have the freedom to plan your retirement freely. In my country you are forced to dedicate a HUGE % of your gross income into ""retirement plans"" but in reality the system is slowly collapsing and with an ever increasing retired-to-active ratio everyone knows none of us young people will ever see again the money we are giving to the government for our retirement (not to mention they are postponing the required age always further). 

Taxes and bill costs are always rising despite incomes are decreasing, and for most people salaries are barely enough to keep going. This is what happens when a country wide economy slowly collapse because of corrupted government, de-industrialization, and population aging. There are not many options for saving because salaries are already low. In my situation I may be able to save a decent % of my salary but in the end, that would mean saving very few thousand dollars a year, which will never be enough to retire early.

And hey, let's not talk about 3rd world countries... those people must really live life on hard mode. So, be grateful that you at least have the option to save that much money!",financialindependence

Someone had asked her a tuition related question right before class was supposed to start and she kind of rolled it into a 5-7 minute lesson about the basics of FIRE. 

I thought it was super cool of them to share that since A) they certainly had no obligation to give up class time to talk about it and B) a lot of young folks in there are about to graduate and could really benefit in the long run if they start to apply FIRE related principles straight out of college.

Edit: thought this sub would find this experience to be an interesting read, my apologies if I wasted your time

Edit 2: Some of the key points touched on in the lesson for those interested:


* What is passive income and what are some methodologies you can use to attain passive income (side projects and the like)
* Invest in yourself, especially at this age and you will thank yourself down the road. A couple of specifics she mentioned were books and online courses. Along the same line she also said that applicable knowledge is super important to being able to get hired out of college, as in pay attention and get something for your money rather than just showing up for the sole purpose of working towards a diploma. 
* Consider the marginal happiness acquired when buying ""stuff""; as in, there is decreased return in happiness the more things you buy (generally speaking). Buy only the things that truly make you happy and save where you can.

802,Wife got laid off yesterday...,,960,5m71vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5m71vt/wife_got_laid_off_yesterday/,1483630856.0,"And we didn't lose any sleep over it. The layoff came as a shock to both of us as her company seemed to be doing fine financially and there haven't been any previous layoffs there over the past year. Luckily, because we've been working towards FI, the only real impact is that our savings rate is going to drop from 50% to around 25% until she finds work again. I make enough to cover all of our monthly bills and debt obligations, and we don't carry any CC debt, so we shouldn't even have to dip into our emergency fund. Therefore, no immediate change in lifestyle for us.

We are not FI yet and won't be for many years (I posted last month about how we finally just hit a NW of $0), but even if we never RE, I think the freedom from financial stress is the real reward of following the FI mindset. Not so many people are lucky enough (or good enough at saving) that they could lose 30% of their household earnings overnight and be OK.

So in short, thank you to this great community for reminding us daily why living below your means is so important!",financialindependence
803,I FIRED! at age 45. 1.5m,,965,bghjcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bghjcb/i_fired_at_age_45_15m/,1556032422.0,"So lately work has been a bigger source of stress for me than normal.  There are a lot of reasons for it, some of which may have been self inflicted. \[ I have never been good at office politics. \]

I don't have a 6 figure job, but I have invested small amounts for a long period of time and made the most of the windfalls that have come my way.

I decided to take a vacation and during that time I did some math.

My current NW is at about 1.5Mil.

My expenses averaged out for the last five years have been about 24k a year.  \[I killed the mortgage a while back and that helped a ton!\]

My highest expense year was last year at 38k but I did a lot of work on the house and had some unusual and hopefully one time medical bills.

I have no debt.

So between my savings and my investments it looks like I should be able to support myself for the foreseeable future!

When my vacation was over I went back and spoke to my manager and let them know I was going to retire early!

They were a bit surprised but no hard feeling and I have turned in my resignation!

My friend posted a link to a concert announcement in a group text. Naturally, everyone was excited and chatting about it. Almost instantly, I decided that I couldn't/wouldn't go. The tickets were expensive and the flights to get there even more so.

Fast forward a week and the tickets go on sale. My phone BLOWS UP with everyone saying they bought their ticket, making plans, etc. So, I am sitting there feeling left out and lonely af. A few minutes later, I'm entering my credit card info and I spend $1000. ($300 for the ticket, $700 for the flight). I instantly feel like shit. $1k to do drugs and dance with my friends for two days. Worth it? Idk.

I am still on track to save $40k this year but it's only February. I'm sure there will be many more random concert/festival announcements in my near future. This always happens to me. I feel left out and decide to fly halfway around the world and spend ungodly sums to hang out with the people in my life. How do I deal?

EDIT: Ok, your responses are really good. Here's my action plan.

1. Fucking be realistic in my budgeting. Be sure to have a fund for random fun times. 
2. Adjust my perspective on FIRE. It's not a zero sum game. This isn't a religion. I can create my own vision of FIRE which complements my life and goals.
3. Figure out why I feel negative emotions when I am unable to or decide not to attend events or go on trips that I'm invited to. This is a difficult one but, it's clearly necessary.

807,My experience going car-free,,959,dg6y5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dg6y5r/my_experience_going_carfree/,1570752597.0,"I recently moved to San Francisco for a job and sold my car and gone car free - it's actually been way easier than I thought!

Here are the pros and cons:

**Pros:**

* I save a LOT of money - total of $300/mo + $13k lump sum selling my car
   * \-$200 gas
   * \-$200 insurance/maintenance/registration
   * \-$100 parking
   * \+$100 monthly transit pas
   * \+$100 assorted lyfts
* I don't have to stress about traffic/parking/getting in an accident anymore - it's nice!
* I walk way more and am in better shape - I've gone from averaging 2 miles/day to 4 miles/day
* I have more time to read/relax during my commute as opposed to being behind the wheel
* I can go out and drink without worrying about driving home or leaving my car somewhere overnight

**Cons:**

* Doing errands is harder - I'm lucky I have a roommate with a car for Costco runs, but stuff like that can be a pain with no car
* Need to rent a car for day trips - luckily BART is pretty good in getting me most places in the bay but I still had to rent a car for a weekend trip to Napa
* Reliant on public transit - SF has an OK public transit network but service can be sketchy at times, which is a pain

&#x200B;

Overall, I would highly recommend going car-free if you have the means to.  Both from a financial stance, but also quality of life :)  


Edit: One caveat noted in some comments is that I am lucky to have a roommate with a car - this is certainly the case.  However, I only ever use his car for costco runs which we do 1-2x/month.  If I had to replace these with lyfts (or just not go to costco and instead go to my local market), my overall cost savings would probably drop $25-50 month, but would still come out greatly ahead.",financialindependence
808,Just sent my mortgage payoff in! My $0.02 on my experiences.,,959,8r2dt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8r2dt9/just_sent_my_mortgage_payoff_in_my_002_on_my/,1528987346.0,"I just received my payoff quote and sent off my last mortgage payment. Debt free at 44! Paid off a 30-year mortgage in 8 years, saving over $80,000 in interest. Damn it feels good!

My wife and I teach at local colleges and combined don't make more than $90k/year before taxes. No kids (maybe cheating, but that does make things less expensive, YMMV). We deliberately bought a house well within our budget anticipating early payoff and put a lot of personal work into it to make it comfortable.

My advice to younger folks looking into home and car ownership:

**1) Buy well within your means. And be realistic about your means.** There is a difference between what works and what you want, and you need to learn to be initially content with basics. Don't buy that shiny luxury car on credit. Buy a good used car and learn to take care of basic maintenance yourself. Save up and pay in cash if able. Same with the first house. When you get free of debt, then you can start looking at that shiny car and that pristine house.

**2) Keep a well stocked emergency fund for the inevitable storm**. You will probably shift careers several times in your life and you need to be able to weather periods of unemployment.

**3) Do math. Really.** If you weren't great at math in school, still try to learn how interest works against you when taking out debt. Use reputable mortgage/loan interest calculators online and explore payoffs. I use spreadsheets to calculate and track all of my finances and it is invaluable when attempting to forecast.

**4) Don't assume more debt than absolutely necessary. What the bank will lend you and what you can safely afford are two wildly different numbers.** By all means, get a 30-year-fixed mortgage, but see what it would take to pay that off a few decades early, and use *that* number to determine how much house you can afford. See item 3. Avoid PMI with an appropriate downpayment. If you can't afford the downpayment, you can't afford the house. If you take out all the mortgage that the lender will give you, you will be a debt slave for many, many years.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**EDIT: RIP Inbox! I've tried to reply to a bunch of posters but only managed to answer a few questions. Here are a few:**

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Q: How much was the mortgage compared to your income?**

A: Purchased a cottage for $168,000 in 2010 (a buyer's market after the recession). Yeah, this isn't Beverly Hills. Some of you probably have more expensive dog houses. Put $35,000 down on a 30-year fixed mortgage, 4.2%. PITI was less than $1000/month, which was a bit more than 20% of my take-home pay.

I was able to put about $1300 into savings every month toward the end by some rather ruthless budgeting and some side contract work, and I kept 6-months emergency expenses in savings. When I accumulated significant excess savings and was assured all liabilities were covered for the next year, I'd slam a big payment down on principal once or twice a year.

**Q: Why didn't you go with a 15-year fixed mortgage?**

A: I initially went with 30-year-fixed as I was in a new job and wasn't 100% sure of how quickly I could pay it off, so I went with flexibility. Once I got a stable picture of our finances I saw that I could do even better with 15-year, so I refinanced a few years ago to help expedite the payoff.

**Q: Why not just pay minimum and invest the rest?**

A: Personal satisfaction and security. Knowing that I don't have to worry about a mortgage payment ever again, or worry whether the stock market will beat my mortgage costs over 30 years, is priceless to me. Early payoff is a guaranteed return (albeit probably less than the stock market), and now I can devote what I would have paid to my mortgage over the next 22 years to savings and investing. And I was maxing out my IRAs over the last several years while doing this.

Yes, I very possibly left some money on the table by not putting more into the stock market. We'll see in 22 years how much that matters, but all I know is that I am safe and comfortable NOW and am putting nearly 50% of my pay into savings and investments. 

22 extra years of being worry-free; it's hard to put a price tag on that.

**Q: What about the mortgage interest deduction?!? Didn't you just walk away from $80,000 in deductions by paying off early?**

A: The mortgage was initially only for ~$134,000. What I was paying for mortgage interest every year only made itemizing for the mortgage interest deduction barely worthwhile for the first two years or so of the mortgage. Remember, it's a deduction from taxable income, not a tax credit, so the actual benefit on my income was a couple hundred dollars at best. Ever since the standard deduction has always been the better choice. The mortgage interest deduction was never a compelling motivator to maintain an outstanding mortgage.",financialindependence

812,Has it been a whole year? Yep. (or: an early retirement update),,947,8nncm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8nncm7/has_it_been_a_whole_year_yep_or_an_early/,1527811215.0,"**\*\*BACKGROUND\*\***

**\*\*Introduction\*\***: This post is the final monthly update in an early\-retirement series. I will be posting twice yearly: once around June 6 \(retirement anniversary\) and once around January 1 \(end of year finances\). As these posts have become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend nearly an entire day on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. Please check comments and posts from previous posts to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I no longer take the time to say so individually.

**\*\*Model\*\***: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My max goal withdrawal rate is 3&#37; of each year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month \($30k per year\) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3&#37; withdrawal rate is below the 100&#37; historically safe mark of 3.2&#37; for fifty\-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20&#37; above the original target amount \(meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5&#37; instead of 3&#37; if restarting from the peak\); and our actual withdrawal rate was averaging less than 2&#37; of the original portfolio balance \(due to earning additional income\) when we received an unexpected $30k windfall \(meaning that our current withdrawal rate is actually negative\). The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 \($2618 adjusted for inflation\).

**\*\*Career\*\***: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors \(1997\-2001\) and a doctorate \(2001\-2005\) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years \(2005\-2017, entirely with CVS\). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships \($25k\), employment during college \($20k\), prior savings from high school employment \($5k\), revenue from an eBay business while in college \($10k\), and massive help from my parents \($90k\). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70&#37;.

**\*\*Finances\*\***: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95&#37; of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60&#37; VTSAX \(total US stock market\) / 20&#37; VFWAX \(total INTL stock market\) / 20&#37; VWLUX \(US municipal bonds\). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income \(future employment?\), social security \($10k/yr?\), inheritance \($500k?\), house equity \(no heirs?\), universal health care \(probable?\), or universal basic income \(possible?\). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

**\*\*FINAL MONTHLY UPDATE\*\***

**\*\*Spending\*\***: Living expenses for the month came to $1999. This is $774 under the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 27.9&#37; under budget for the month, 8.1&#37; over for the year, and 14.9&#37; over since retirement. We generated $1039 of income this month from my wife wanting to work and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $960 this month, thus our pro\-rated, annually\-adjusted withdrawal rate is 1.04&#37; for the month, \-5.16&#37; for the year, and \-0.76&#37; since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro\-rated, annually\-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 2.16&#37; for the month, 3.24&#37; for the year, and 3.45&#37; since retirement.

**\*\*Investments\*\***: The portfolio went from $1,130,151 to $1,147,124 \(a 1.50&#37; increase for the month\), which went down to a new total of \(drum\-roll\) $1,146,164 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is a 11.73&#37; increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full\-time employee generating $53.14/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $17.59/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $\-4.75/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate. Dividends included, VTSAX \(61&#37; AA\) went up 2.72&#37; this month \(2.45&#37; up for 2018\); VFWAX \(20&#37; AA\) went down 1.18&#37; \(1.39&#37; down for 2018\); VWLUX \(19&#37; AA\) went up 1.17&#37; \(down 0.52&#37; for 2018\).

**\*\*Reflections\*\***: This was our lowest spending month thus far. No significant purchases or expenses to speak of. The market recouped some of its losses from its February jitters. I had considered increasing my international exposure but am currently glad that I refrained.

**\*\*Experiences\*\***: I won the very non\-prestigious Strolling Jim Marathon on May 5 by twenty\-three minutes. I pre\-paid for this one as a backup before I won the state championship in April. I didn’t want to show up. I didn’t even plan on finishing the entire course to be honest, but I made a deal with myself to just treat it like a moderate effort training run. I was nowhere near 100&#37;, but I broke the course record by ten minutes. I watched many more movies \(about forty, mostly silent\). I got lucky and bowled consecutive 170s on my first day back in eighteen months. I baked for the first time in my life \(gingerbread cookies\). I read a few books. I kayaked for the first time this year. I have averaged 63 minutes per day of physical activity over the past six weeks \(running/swimming/cycling/weighlifting\) with at least thirty minutes every single day. Running in the heat sucks.

**\*\*Upcoming\*\***: My time at the museum has run its course. I no longer find it stimulating. I plan to spend time volunteering as a running coach in some local clubs and as a pacer in some local races. I’d like to maintain my current lifestyle of more reading, kayaking, bowling, running, cycling, swimming, and watching classic films. I will try my best to do whatever the fuck I want.

**\*\*YEAR ONE\*\***

**\*\*Portfolio\*\***: Again, the portfolio went from $1,025,772 to $1,146,164 \(an 11.73&#37; increase\) after expenses. Living expenses for the year came to $36,582. This is $4768 \(14.9&#37;\) over the first year targeted amount of $31,814. We generated $46,452 of income from my wife wanting to work, my old book royalties, an unexpected tax refund, and an unexpected inheritance. Our investment withdrawal was \-$9870 this year \(a $9870 deposit\), thus our withdrawal rate was –0.76&#37;. Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 3.45&#37;. Without the tax refund, inheritance, small splurge as a direct result of the inheritance, and the delayed construction of the cabin \(a measure that I consider the best indicator going forward\), our withdrawal rate would have been 2.1&#37; \(3.5&#37; with no supplemental income under this same scenario. In short, I have finally arrived at the conclusion that our COL creates an effective withdrawal rate of 2&#37;, but it would be 3.5&#37; without additional income.

**\*\*Accomplishments\*\***: I consider these the highlights of my first year away from work: broke three hours in a marathon, broke three hours in a marathon for a second time \(including a course record and state championship victory\), won a second marathon by setting another course record, set a personal record in the half marathon, set a personal record in the 1500m swim, built a cabin, saw a total solar eclipse, took a two week driving vacation, read the three longest books of my life, got around to watching every movie we own, got around to playing every video game we own, got around to listening to every album we own, wrote in my daily journal every single day without exception, tackled all of my CE requirements, became a volunteer tour guide and paleontologist assistant at the natural history museum, created an astronomy timeline exhibit for the museum, made plans to become a volunteer running coach, watched Game of Thrones, re\-watched Parks and Recreation, painted for the first time, played a round of golf for the first time, grilled out for the first time, held a drunken scumbag at gunpoint for the first time, kayaked for the first time, went metal detecting for the first time, mastered the Rubik’s cube, mapped our property in detail, planted trees, fixed the driveway, made a creek in our woods, picked up a lot of litter, finished Final Fantasy XV, made monthly reddit posts on FI, and completed a 100\-point gratuity list.

**\*\*Greater Amount\*\***: What have I done more of since leaving work? Running \(about 1500 miles\), swimming \(now twice weekly\), weightlifting \(now twice weekly\), volunteering \(almost weekly\), hiking \(several treks\),  watching movies, solving puzzles, visiting my parents, spending time with my wife, housework, yardwork, cooking, video gaming, reading, studying astronomy, studying paleontology, napping, and doing whatever the fuck I want.

**\*\*Same Amount\*\***: What have I done about the same amount of since leaving work? Cycling \(kept focus on running\), bowling \(to favor a running injury\), visiting friends \(who are no less busy\), listening to SACDs \(distracted by internet\), and watching television \(trying to avoid too much\).

**\*\*Little Progress\*\***: What have I failed to do much of since leaving work? Learning to play an instrument \(lack of talent\), target shooting \(lack of interest\), improving my Spanish and Japanese \(got lazy\), being able to bench press my body weight \(tough hill to climb\), helping fight the opiate epidemic \(burned out\), going to yard sales \(lost interest\), reducing internet time \(too much political interest\), writing a sci\-fi novel \(still in planning stages\), deconverting religious adherents \(taking a break\), stargazing \(often monotonous\), cleaning up our woods \(needs it\), studying cartography \(due to astronomy/paleontology\), painting \(only twice\), kayaking \(only twice\), metal detecting \(only twice\), and camping \(only once\).

**\*\*The Future\*\***: This is the final monthly update. See you around Jan 1. You will be okay without me.",financialindependence

My wife and I decided it was time to family up and have some kiddos once we hit 30. After a year we were not able to conceive and decided to go with IVF. The first embryo transfer didn't take, the second brought us our now 18 month old son, and the most recent transfer sadly ended with a late miscarriage earlier this year. The struggle to conceive is frustrating, but the miscarriage put us at an all time low.

All that to say the pursuit of FI put us in a position that we could spend +25K on what felt like endless fertility doctor visits without stressing about money. This journey has been a tough one, but smart financial decisions have made it somewhat easier. 

So my FI date keeps getting pushed out, but we will take some of our savings to get away for a week and just focus on our marriage. I'm not sure how this process would have looked if we didn't have the financial means to do so through the pursuit of FIRE.

Just wanted to let everyone know how the pursuit of FIRE can help in ways you may have never imagined, like paying for the opportunity to have a family. Stay strong y'all!",financialindependence

**UPDATE**: As of February 29th, I am no longer a member of the 2 comma club. But F\*ck It, I took a long time getting this information together and writing this post. I’m not shelving it because of a bad cough named after a crap beer.

Besides, I think it’s even more relevant. Though my Net Worth has dropped due to market volatility, I’ve diversified enough that my WR doesn’t change. The passive income from my investments is still 1.8X my annual expenses.

The changes I have made in 2019 have given me additional levers to pull and reduce my spending level even further if there is a protracted market correction.

**2019 Year in Review**

Homebases:

***Q1: Medellin, Colombia***

PROS: Medellin has become one of my favorite cities. The weather is literally the best I have ever experienced: not humid, spring temperatures, no bugs, [mountain views](https://imgur.com/NE20EZx), lots of green. Cost of living is lower than many places I have lived in SE Asia.

CONS: While SIGNIFICANTLY safer than 25 years ago (Pablo Escobar died 1993), you still have to take precautions (take cabs at night, be extra vigilant of your belongings, never take your eye off your drink, etc) that I wouldn’t take in any of the other cities I lived this year.

***Q2: Vienna, Austria***

PROS: Voted the most “Livable city in the world” for the second year in a row, it’s easy to fall in love with Vienna. The city is drop dead gorgeous. Public transportation is extensive. The culture and arts scene is world class.

CONS: It’s expensive. It’s still cheaper than a MCOL city in the US (roughly equivalent to Kansas City, Mo), but about twice the price of Medellin. Also, it’s a Schengen Agreement country, which means US Citizens only get 90 days out of every 180 days to live there (or any of the 26 other European Schengen countries). Schengen is a pain in the ass visa situation for me, which led me to applying for a Retirement Visa in Spain this year. Results and process to the Spain Visa to be posted in the near future.

Additional cities visited: Slovenia, Croatia (Dubrovnik), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Mostar). Austria’s central location in Europe allows for easy trips via bus, train, and cheap flights. I took a one week trip through the Balkans to [Dubrovnik while watching the final season of Game of Thrones](https://imgur.com/CrTW2Pt).

***Q3: Sofia, Bulgaria***

This was the [subject of my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/dobzp3/overseas_fire_spending_update_q3_2019/), so rather than repeat, you can read up on what Sofia was like. TL;DR- Bulgaria is extremely underrated: beautiful mountains, [sunny beaches](https://imgur.com/OqUPVtJ), and low cost of living.

Additional cities visited: Austria (Vienna), Czechia (Prague), Serbia (Belgrade), Bulgaria (Plovdiv and Rila).

***Q4: Limassol, Cyprus***

PROS: Sunshine for days. Seriously. Cyprus averages 340 sunny days a year. We lived a [15 minute walk to the beach](https://imgur.com/a/7NAWhNQ). Cypriots are very friendly folks. Had the workings of a social circle forming, which makes any place 10 X better.

CONS: It’s expensive. Also not worth the cost, which makes any place 10 X worse. COL is roughly equal to Vienna, but has none of the advantages. Urban sprawl is a significant issue. Walkablility is restricted and public transportation is scarce. Food choices are limited (every meal involves meat on a stick). Our shared flat was $450 per month and I felt like I was [re-living my impoverished college days](https://imgur.com/IME4AKU).

Other cities visited: Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Kyrenia), [Israel (Jerusalem)](https://imgur.com/3ETPzLf), Palestine (Bethlehem), Italy (Rome), USA (Las Vegas).

**Income:**

|(In USD)|**Full Year 2019**|
|:-|:-|
|Dividend and Interest Income|10,383|
|Rental Income|19,111|
|Rental Expenses|(8,090)|
|Misc Bonus|933|
|**Annual Income Average**|**22,336**|
|*Monthly Income*|*1,861*|

***Dividends and Interest:*** Earned roughly 1.7% in dividends and interest. I have moved about 18% of my funds into VYM, a Vanguard High Yield ETF, which pays about 3.3% in dividends. This was a mid-year move, so 2020 should have a higher amount here.

***Rental Income:*** I had zero vacancies this year, which both increases my income and decreases my expenses. I like my renter, hopefully she will re-up this year with a modest 3.5% increase.

***Rental Expenses:***

Homeowners Association (HOA) Dues - $4,211

Property Taxes - $2519

My two biggest rental expenses and I have no control over either. The dues covers maintenance, insurance on the property, a movie theater, pool, hot tub, gym, billiard room, and racquetball court.

Management Fees - $1077

I changed property managers last year, and it’s been great. My new manager charges me 5% per month plus one month of rent if we have to find new tenants. Other than an occasional email to approve a maintenance request, this income is truly passive.

Renters Insurance - $140

Cleaning and Maintenance - $1410

***Misc Bonus:*** I received $900 as a sign up bonus for rolling over my 401K to a Merrill Edge IRA. But the bigger story here is I lost THOUSANDS because I was a lazy dumba\*s and kept my previous 401K in my prior employer’s plan for 5 years. This cost me $90 a month in 401K fees to T. Rowe Price. $90 a month FOR 5 YEARS. It’s my own fault for not paying attention. Sometimes I wanna kick my own ass.

As an added bonus, my account with Merrill boosts my cash back reward on my Bank of America card to 2.6%.

**Expenses:**

|(In USD)|**Total for 2019**|**Per Month Avg**|**% of Spending**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Food|4,303|359|35%|
|Housing|2,735|228|23%|

|**Total Spending**|**12,163**|**1,014**||

*\*Note expenses above are only my costs. My girlfriend and I shared expenses. Her share is NOT included in the numbers above.*

My expenses for 2019 are the lowest I have ever had. 2019 is the first full year I have had a girlfriend living with me and splitting my living expenses. Having a partner really drives my COL lower than I expected. She pays for 50% the rent and 40% of the food budget. In addition, I don’t go out partying as much, so my alcohol and nightclub budget is drastically reduced. With the side benefit of watching her wake up and smile at me every morning, this was a major savings bonus.

***Top 4 Expenses:***

***Food:*** Continues to be my biggest expense, even with the GF paying 40%. No way around the fact I’m a wanna-be fat ass. I detail why my food budget is expensive in the [Q3 post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/dobzp3/overseas_fire_spending_update_q3_2019/) Check it out for details. TL;DR- I eat a protein heavy diet (equivalent to FIVE 4 oz (114 g) steaks a day) and I avoid simple starches (potatos, rice, pasta, etc) that could fill me up on the cheap.

***Housing:*** For four months this year, we were house sitting in Vienna. I would not choose to live in an expensive city, but my girlfriend is Austrian and she has family about a one-hour train ride away. House sitting provided me the opportunity to keep my housing costs low (I estimate our flat would have [rented for around $1,000 per month](https://imgur.com/eRhbM52)), while living in a beautiful expensive city, and at the same time making my girlfriend happy. Definition of a WIN/WIN.

Excluding house sitting, we spend between $320 to $500 per month TOTAL ($160 to $250 each). In LCOL cities such as [Medellin, Colombia](https://imgur.com/uOZfx27) and Sofia, Bulgaria, $500 per month covers shared housing in desirable upper-middle-class neighborhoods.

***International Flights:***

Two trans-Atlantic and one trans-Pacific drive the bulk of this cost. Flights within Europe continue to be shockingly inexpensive. Deal of day for me was the $45 round trip Cyprus to Israel flight that allowed me to visit the Middle East for the first time in my life.

* Medellin, Colombia to London, England = $370
* London, England to Vienna = $65
* Dubrovnik to Vienna= $77
* Vienna, Austria to Varna, Bulgaria = $20
* Varna, Bulgaria to Larnaca, Cyprus = $30
* Cyprus to Israel (round trip) = $45
* Larnaca, Cyprus to Skopje, Macedonia= $19
* Skopje, Macedonia to [Rome, Italy](https://imgur.com/a/vHNjNBQ) = $20
* Rome, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada $230
* Las Vegas to Manila= $375

***Healthcare and Insurance:***

* Travel Health Insurance = $680
* ACA Subsidized US Insurance = $230
* Out of Pocket = $154

These numbers do not include my HSA contribution of $3,500. I count that as a long term investment, not an expense.

I discussed my healthcare strategy in my prior post, but to recap, I have a three tier approach:

1. Use Local Healthcare for out of pocket costs. As a rule, I can get all routine checkups and medical tests done cheaper overseas. [Out of Pocket Health Care Costs](https://imgur.com/a/98uoXPN)
2. Travel insurance is my transition safety net. If something more significant happens that can’t be handled in a country I am living in, travel insurance is used to stabilize me and get me to the US. My travel insurance, which covers me WORLDWIDE (except the US) is $680 per year.
3. US insurance for anything catastrophic. Once my travel insurance brings me back to the US, ""Obamacare"" takes over. I have an ACA subsidized High Deductible Silver plan. This plan allows me to invest in Health Savings Accounts (HSA). I rarely use US medical care. But \*knock on wood\*, if anything catastrophic happens, my ACA is my fallback.

As part of the Spain Retirement visa I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I am required to have Spanish Private Health Insurance. I have a future post I’m writing on cost and coverage of Private Health Insurance (non-government-subsidized) in Europe vs. Worldwide Travel Insurance vs. US Health Insurance.

**Invested Assets:**

\*Amounts rounded for privacy

|Retirement Accounts (Trad. IRA, Roth IRA, HSA)|END OF YEAR 2019|
|:-|:-|
|VTI|315,000|

|**Total Retirement Accounts**|**715,038**|
|||
|Real Estate|285,000|
|**Total Invested Assets**|**1,000,038**|

***ETFs and Index Funds:*** The bulk of my investments are ETFs. 78% of my retirement assets are in three funds: VTI (Vanguard Total Market ETF), VYM (Vanguard High Yield ETF), and QQQ (Invesco QQQ NASDAQ 100 ETF).

I am still in the process of transferring and consolidating my positions. There is \~$160,000 in random funds from a previous account that will be moving into the funds above in 2020. 

***Real Estate:*** 28% of my retirement assets are in a single unit condominium rental with no mortgage. As mentioned previously, the rental generates \~$11,000 in cash that pays for my living expenses.

***Real Estate Value***:  I update my real estate value once a year since there isn’t an accurate real-time way of getting appraisal costs. Sales of identical units in my condominium complex drive the estimated home value above.

**2019 Key Lessons Learned**

***Hitting the One Million Dollar mark felt good, but it does not fundamentally change anything I’ll be doing.***

I’m tracking well under the 4% SWR benchmark. I’ve lowered my sequence of returns risk with five years of Early Retirement. I don’t plan to “reset” my SWR and my annual spending is unlikely to change.

**​**Compared to a MCOL city in the US, I am saving about 70% in living expenses. I don't make sacrifices in my standard of living. In some countries, my reduced monthly expenses still includes maid service and dining out once a day.

***Hitting One Million Dollars gives me more of a cushion.***

Even if the market continues to fall, I won't panic and make significant withdrawals from my retirement funds. I have set myself up for 2020 to reduce expenses further to prevent selling into a downturn. 

As an example:

* I’m ready for a home base. I don’t plan to stop traveling, but I’m looking to make Spain home base for the foreseeable future. Living in a new country long term will mean less international flights and more domestic day trips. International flights were one of my Top 3 expenses last year.
* Shopping and Food expense can be reduced. Every move I have has a ""start up cost"", as I buy a new blender, knives, pans, bed linens, towels, and cooking supplies. Settling down will reduce my upfront costs.

**2019 Summary**

It was a good year. Got a girl. Got the cash. Earned $22K in passive income. Spent $12K, while traveling to 15 countries. For 2020, I’m looking forward to getting my Spain retirement visa and for the Coronavirus to F\*ck Off.

Ask me any questions you may have. I'm in the Philippines ATM, so expect a time zone delay.

815,"Is anyone here actually FIRE using only stock market investments (and not ""faux-FIRE"")? Without managing rentals, doing part-time work, or blogging?",,942,bdj0yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bdj0yg/is_anyone_here_actually_fire_using_only_stock/,1555350472.0,"PLEASE prove me wrong because I'm starting to thinking FIRE is just trading a 9-5 job for a different job.

&#x200B;

I've been living the FIRE mentality for several years now; mainly following the principles and skimming blogs of big FIRE folks. One thing I'm noticing is that **none of these people are actually retired,** they just found alternative, often un-reproducible means to working instead of doing 9-5. *They just traded one job for another.*

I've listened to several episodes of [MadFientist's podcast](https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/) and the majority of these big FIRE names are still working a lot of hours and bringing in a lot of money through:

* FIRE blogging (ads, referrals, education) - GCC stopped saying blogging income is [""an insignificant amount of his income""](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/gcc-business-review-2018/)
* real estate management (once-in-a-lifetime accumulation post-2009)
* aggressive side-hustles
* book sales (Frugalwoods)
* working part-time remotely

most of which I'd argue **isn't reproducible** for the majority; because you need to have a niche skill, write well, there can only be so many FIRE bloggers, or you're spending so much time ""supplementing your nest egg"" that I wouldn't even consider it retirement. Real estate in particular is a really painful, annoying point because most folks struggle to even afford their primary residence much less acquire rentals (and even after that, you trade your 9-5 job to become a 24/7 on-call landlord).

&#x200B;

EDIT: Alright thanks everyone, my doubts are sufficiently dissolved. I am a believer that it's possible to FIRE without relying on post FIRE income. I still have my doubts about certain bloggers like GCC but that's my criticism of them being fakers and not of the possibility to FIRE by solely investing in stocks and bonds alone.",financialindependence

Funny enough, my brother is a $100k USD+ techy in a HCOL city with a fortune 500 company, but that's beside the point.

**Backstory**

I work in the hospitality industry at a restaurant which comes with a unique situation. I have no benefits, nor time paid off but get to choose exactly how much I want to work. No formal education other than a couple of college courses, but a lot of time spent independently educating myself to further my career.

I live in Toronto, Canada. Share a 700sqft 2br with a roommate in the downtown core. Live relatively frugally in some areas, but also splurge an absurd amount in others. I recognize I am very fortunate to be in the situation I am in, and also that there are many ways I can still improve my spending. Anyway, break down of my finances from past 12 months.

**Couple notes:**
 
1. **Insurance**, for now, is just renter's insurance and long-term disability insurance. I bought the latter due to the risks associated with working a physically dependent job. I also need to buy extended medical coverage soon, for things not covered by Canadian health care.

2. **I walk to work** every day, a nice perk of living in the downtown core, 15 mins usually. But the public transit costs are still quite high because I often go around the city for other activities.

3. **My hobbies**, outside of dining out, are mostly free or extremely cheap. I play sports at the community center which is usually free. I am competing in an amateur billiards league. The league is very affordable and I practice during the days when the rates are lower. A small perk of working nights I guess.

4. **My dining budget is obscenely high**, I know. In my defense, it is my only serious vice. Also, it is my profession, being well informed about the current state of the industry and food scene has helped me in my career.

5. **Education** covers the many books I buy and tastings I attend to improve my knowledge and hopefully further my career.

6. **""Purchases""** is a very broad category that covers random things I end up having to buy. I barely own anything, I never go shopping or own any boy toys. It's mostly things like my laptop breaking after 7 years or having to spend $400+ on formal attire for a new job, these are unavoidable. I rarely spend the full 1k, I save the rest if there is extra.

7. **I work 45-47h/wk**  between my two jobs when I am working. This averages across the year to 44h/wk because I take time off which is unpaid in my profession. Usually, 2 weeks in a single vacation and a couple other random days here and there add up to approx. 3+ weeks off.

8. **I declare my tips in full**, which is rare in the industry. This really helped me in getting my first lease since I have some proof of income. I also hope this makes it easier for me to get a mortgage, will have to meet with a broker soon to find out for sure.

9. **Do not quit your job and apply to a restaurant.** My story is a rose-tinted one, 99% of service staff do not make this much. Only several restaurants in major cities pay this well, and those positions are extremely competitive. That being said, if you know what you are getting into and are cut out for it, it is a satisfying and well-paying job.

EDIT: Because this has come up in several comments

Note 10. I get fed at work, a very common perk of any decent restaurant. Although this is the first time it is being listed on my paystub as a taxable benefit LOL. My new company is very above board...",financialindependence

Real Estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion in this sub so please consider if this isn't for you, it doesn't mean it's not helpful to someone. This post is for anyone that is willing to consider real estate as part of their portfolio.

I'm talking about holding physical real estate with a bank loan or mortgage. If that's not for you, consider REITs. Personally, I don't own any REITs since I own physical real estate but they have consistently proved to be less volatile and more profitable than total market indexes. [Average REIT Returns vs Stocks Over Long Periods](https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/comparing-average-reit-returns-and-stocks-over-long-periods)

In truth, physical real estate is one of the most powerful and accessible tools for people with common jobs to build wealth. I don't need to rehash why, as hundreds of articles have done before. [Why Real Estate Builds Wealth More Consistently Than Other Asset Classes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgreene/2018/11/27/why-real-estate-builds-wealth-more-consistently-than-other-asset-classes/#69a0ba2a5405)

Lastly, below's an illustration of a recent change I made that I hope resonates with the younger FIRE community. I went from living in a shared 2-bedroom apartment to a one-bedroom apartment, and am saving an extra $1296 per month doing it. How so? I invested $62k and bought a multi-family home, living in one unit and renting out the other 3. Don't have $62k for a down payment? You probably qualify for a FHA loan for 3.5% down. Below is my expense breakdown for the first month of ownership. My only regret is not doing it sooner... and cashing on in the current 3% 30-year fixed mortgage.

[https://imgur.com/a/uCtkRVG](https://imgur.com/a/uCtkRVG)

There's lots of advice about churning credit cards, cut out cable, reduce their cellphone bill, etc for a few hundred bucks a year. What about looking at your unused or underutilized assets. In this real estate focused post, that could mean renting out and extra room or garage.

While I love my VTSAX for it's simplicity and returns, I expect this investment will have 2-4x the returns of VTSAX and add diversification to my portfolio.

Edit: I should add I've been a landlord for 8 years but this is my first owner-occupied property. I stand by the fact I have 9 units and have done nothing but collect rent and place 2 tenants in the past year. I'm not living in some fairytale where I don't understand the work required.

There's also already a fair amount of people warning others about the dangers and pitfalls. Good, everyone should know the risk and it's not for everyone.

I should add the 2-4x VTSAX is largely based on leverage home appreciation. Cash flow is more in line with 1-1.2x VTSAX and requires some work.",financialindependence
818,Pay yourself first.,,937,62lso5,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/62lso5/pay_yourself_first/,1490973487.0,"We have all heard this before, right?  I remember reading it first in Rich Dad Poor Dad, and I always thought to myself “wow, what a great concept!”  Well as I get older (34 now) and have had time to get both my financial life in order as well as the rest of my life, I realize it’s a lot more powerful than the simplistic statement it sounds like. Having grown up as a procrastinator (I was the kid who did their homework in the class before the one it was due) this has been a long, slow change for me but also a very good one.


Personally, I’ve taken the FIRE approach that includes my health as well.  What good is buying yourself time if it’s at your own expense?  I’m sure many people have heard the phrase “at least you’ve got your health” at one time or another.  That’s because at the end of the day, that’s what’s most important in life, your health!  We talk about money here in /r/fi more than anything but it’s just our vehicle to enjoy more of our health, later in life. In fact, I think I’m going to start referring to it as my Whealth (make sure to pronounce the H).  


So get to the point – to me, paying yourself first extends far beyond putting $5500 into my IRA by April, or maxing out my 401k.  Those are the more simple parts of the concept that don’t take any thought or action once you set them up.  What I’m talking about with paying yourself first is a lifestyle that can be applied in many parts of our lives.  Some personal examples:


* I put my kids to bed at 8pm every night.  While they brush their teeth, I brush mine.  By brushing my teeth at 8pm, I get a couple of benefits.  I am no longer interested in eating again for the rest of the night because then I’d have to brush my teeth & floss again, which I don’t really enjoy doing in the first place.  Also, my bedtime routine is a lot more pleasant knowing I can walk upstairs and just fall into bed with no additional work, all because I paid myself first.  I avoid the excess calories of an evening snack, the cost of them, the time wasted, and the negative impact on my bedtime routine (it wakes me up for some reason).  


* Making lunch the night before/after dinner.  Getting up early sucks, and waiting until I’m about to walk out the door to make lunch for myself is a recipe for whealth disaster.  When I inevitably go to work without lunch, I’m taking the double hit of unhealthy food that costs so much more than the leftovers or PB&J I was going to make.  Not to mention the fact that I have to drive 7 miles each way to a place to buy non gas-station food.


* Getting gas on the way home from work.  This one is more of a sanity cost where often I’ll pass up gas because “I can make it until tomorrow and I don’t feel like doing it now” that ends up with me getting gas in colder, often shitty weather conditions the next morning AND potentially making me late for work.  This one also ties in with my “don’t be a victim” mentality.*


* Working out at 5am.  Man, this one sucks.  I hate waking up early but I can say a couple of positives about doing this.  There is no way for you to “run out of time” to workout when you take this approach.  There is the super health benefit of getting that workout done, there is the mental boost of starting out your day having completed such a task, and you get some quality “me” time to focus on yourself.  The alternative usually looks like “Today was a rough day… I’m pretty tired.  I’ll just make sure I hit it tomorrow instead.”  And then life happens and you miss 2x, 3x, etc.  Pay yourself first.
At the end of the day, what else are you doing with your time?  For myself and I’m sure many others, it involves playing video games or watching tv mindlessly.  By investing in myself early, the only things I miss out on are the things that I find myself not missing.  I never regret not playing video games 3 weeks ago, but I have often regret not working out or eating healthier sooner.  Set yourself up for success and pay yourself first.


I could go on and on, but the gist of it is: when you pay yourself first, you make your future self happy.  A little pain now truly pays dividends and for me and has improved my general well-being as well as my approach to life.  After reaching this point, the financial side of preparing for FIRE becomes a no-brainer. Build your whealth! J

In April I started working on a net worth tracker for myself. Somewhere along the way it morphed into a sheet for friends, family, and anyone looking to get a hold of their finances. The goal of the sheet is provide you certainty about your financial situation in a time of uncertainty.

Advantages of the sheet over other net worth trackers:

* 100% Free
* No APIs that constantly break. Other trackers that have APIs have to constantly update them and experience periods where the connection is broken.
* Your data is yours. We have no access to your data when you make a copy.
* The sheet is setup to last for many years with minimal to no updates
* Full user guide to make the sheet easy to learn and use

Highlights of the sheet:

* Motivating goal tracking
* Customizable dashboard
* High level of detail if you want it, high level overviews if you don't
* Ability to track self employed users
* Ability to track individuals and couples
* Wedding expense tracker if you need it

In addition to the sheet, I created a full user guide to allow you to jump in and start taking control of your finances.

Edit 2: Updated the link to Version 1.1. On the Instructions tab I included all changes made due to the help of this community. 

For users with the old version, updating to the new version is as simple as copying and pasting beige cells from the 1.0 version to the 1.1 version. You can copy groups of cells at one time. Just be careful not to copy white cells with the beige.  If you copy and paste columns G and H on the Bank Activity tab, the dropdowns will not appear but the sheet will still calculate correctly. Follow the user guide if you need the dropdowns to appear for some reason.",financialindependence

## Intro ##

> Should I include my house in my net worth calculations for FIRE?

This question has been beaten to death on this subreddit, and the best answer is usually along the lines of:

> You can include your house’s principal in your total net worth, but what matters for calculating your FIRE number is the amount of investible assets which will generate the returns to fuel your spending in retirement. Even if your house appreciates in value, those assets aren’t giving you a liquid return unless you take out a loan against them, which probably isn’t the best idea for your primary dwelling.

But I’ve never liked this answer, for the reason that eventually your mortgage will be paid off and your monthly housing expenses will drop. This throws a wrench in using your current monthly spending to estimate how much money you will need to spend in retirement, and it annoyed me enough at work today that I figured I’d solve it. This post is an attempt to give the best approximation I can to how you should really account for a mortgage when planning for FIRE, and just how many years of your life you are leaving on the table if you don’t do this.

----

## Once a Mortgage is Gone, It’s Gone ##

Say that you buy a $500k house, and put $100k down in order to avoid PMI. You get a 30 year mortgage at 4.25% APR. Your monthly mortgage payment will be:

    $400 000 * (0.0425/12)/(1-(1+0.0425/12)^(-(30*12))) = $1968

If we assume a 4% safe withdrawal rate, the amount we have to save to cover our mortgage payments using the standard SWR calculation tells us that in order to FIRE we need to accumulate:

    $1968 * 12 / 0.04 = $590 328

For context, your total payments over the life of the mortgage will be $1968 \* 30 \* 12 = $708 393, entirely generated by that invested sum, and this is a good bit more than just paying the entire $400 000 balance of the outstanding principal outright!

But I contend that this is a silly way to do things, since this means you will be have that $1968 every month in perpetuity. A “safe” way perhaps, but considering that a) that is a huge amount of money to save up (more than the total purchase price of the house!) and b) the greatest sequence of returns risk is in the early years of FIRE and 30 years down the road the extra padding will likely not be needed, this is unnecessarily conservative.

So how should we account for things instead? I would argue that the portion of your monthly spending allocated to mortgage payments should be accounted for in your FIRE budgeting using draw-down calculations. In other words, you should spend your mortgage-allocated invested assets at a rate such that they reach a value of 0 on your last mortgage payment, while still accounting for the fact that they will be generating returns throughout that entire time.

Luckily this is pretty easy in a spreadsheet – it’s precisely the formula for calculating the Present Value of an asset. Assuming a 7% investment return, here’s how much you need to save using the draw-down method:

    =PV(0.07/12, 30*12, -$1968, $0) = $295 769

This is half of what the SWR calculation would tell you!

You can [check out my spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7Y692E_Za0nqJRJJbkerAEdFrQ8ut0dZUqTSqcAwXg/edit?usp=sharing) to see the calculation in action, check the formula against a manual month-by-month calculation, and make a copy of the spreadsheet to try out your own values. Cells in yellow mark the inputs.

## Your Money or Your Life ##

What does this mean in terms of how long you have before reaching FIRE? I’ll grab my NPER() calculation from an older post of mine, [Tips and Tricks for your FIRE Spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5cmanl/tips_and_tricks_for_your_fire_spreadsheets/) so check there for how I calculated these times. Note also that since you pay down the mortgage through this time, there is a circular calculation that has to happen to update the 


Assume you have $60k / yr in non-mortgage spending, $50k / yr in investment savings (a post-tax SR of 37% after including the $1968 \* 12 = $26.3k /yr towards the mortgage), and current invested assets of $0. Now we calculate the time needed to hit the targets needed to cover the mortgage by putting all our savings towards it:

    SWR Method:       $590 k, 8.6 years
    Pay off in Full:  $400 k, 6.4 years
    Draw-down Method: $296 k, 5.0 years

But you probably have investments already, and you probably have a FIRE number in mind. Assume that you instead have $500k already invested, and with a SWR of 4%, your recurring spending makes a non-mortgage FIRE number of $1.5MM. We calculate our time to reach that using the NPER() method, and find that it will take us 8.6 years. Since we’ve been paying down the mortgage over that time, we now calculate our remaining principal using the CUMPRINC() function:

    $400 000 + cumprinc(0.0425/12, 30*12, $400 000, 1, 8.6*12, 1) = $329 685
 
There are two sensible options once you reach this point - route your savings to paying off the mortgage in full, or save less and retire earlier by using the draw-down method. I'll also throw in the now obviously absurd SWR method, and a ""Simple Sum"" method for comparison which simply adds our current mortgage to our non-mortgage FIRE number. We calculate the additional money &amp; time needed for each method as before, and apply it to our original FIRE target to get final calculations:

    SWR Method:       $2.090 MM, 12.0 years
    Simple Sum:       $1.900 MM, 11.0 years
    Pay off in Full:  $1.829 MM, 10.6 years
    Draw-down Method: $1.761 MM, 10.2 years

By using a more realistic calculation for the invested assets required to cover our mortgage, we realize that we can retire **1.4 - 1.8 full years** earlier than expected! This is of course specific to this scenario that I made up, but [play around with the numbers for your own situation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7Y692E_Za0nqJRJJbkerAEdFrQ8ut0dZUqTSqcAwXg/edit?usp=sharing) and you should see just how significant a difference this makes.

One last thought - I played with a few different toy scenarios, and the benefit at FIRE of using the drawdown method over paying off your mortgage is only a few months in all of them. Fully paying off your primary home's mortgage is probably worth the reduction of risk for those extra few months of working.

----

## Notes ##

Assumptions I’m using here:

* You are not paying PMI because you put at least 20% down (though you could incorporate this by extending the methods presented here).
* You will stay in your house for your full duration of your mortgage.
* Your spending and savings are constant until you hit FIRE, and your spending remains constant thereafter.
* There are no market fluctuations. It would be good for someone to run this through an analysis to figure out what multiplier you need to add onto these results counteract sequence of returns risk. Just spitballing, add +20% if shooting for an exact number makes you nervous. 

Some more things to note:

* “But there’s no way that I’m going to live in this house for 30 years!” No, you’re probably going to move a few times. But this method will give you an apples-to-apples comparison of how exactly your FIRE target will change when moving to a new house, and until then should give you an accurate estimate. And thinking it through, if you move to an equally priced home and your investment returns are higher than your mortgage interest, then the lowering of your mortgage payments due to the refresh of the 30 years means that the amount of investments you need allocated to your mortgage should *drop*. Maybe enough to cover closing costs?
* All spending/saving/FIRE numbers are in current-year real dollars. The mortgage payments are in nominal dollars. Market returns are after inflation. The calculations aren't quite apples-to-apples since the mortgage balance will devalue due to inflation over time in real terms. But this is a conservative approach, so consider it a safety factor - a more rigorous calculation would be crystal clear about nominal vs real terms and reach targets quicker.
* You should include non-mortgage housing costs such as insurance, taxes, upkeep, etc. in your monthly spending, since those will persist after you pay off the mortgage.
* Critiques very much welcome. :)",financialindependence

I made this post to explore this deeper and so we can have a discussion and learn together. Feel free to post anything about side hustles, regardless if I mention it below or not. 

**Popular side hustles** 

* Freelancing (programming, art, consulting, welding, etc)
* Tutoring 
* Working security at night 
* Bartending 
* Dog walking 
* Baby sitting 
* House sitting 
* Amazon FBA
* Property management 
* Online tech support 
* Uber/Lyft driving 
* Flipping things (cars, bikes, homes, etc)
* *If your side hustle isn’t mentioned, please share!*

**Misc questions**

* Do you report taxes on your side income? Do you legally have to?
* When should you set up a S-Corp or LLC for your side hustle? For example, let’s say I tutor and earn an additional $10k a year. What if I earned $20k or $30k?
* Which side hustles do you think generate the best $/hour? 
* Which side hustles do you think are most fun? 
* Some employment contracts stipulate that you cannot have another source of non-passive income. Do you just ignore this?
* Which side hustles are traps and not worth it?

Edit: for those that don’t think side hustles are worth it and time spent on a side hustle should instead be devoted toward your main job (OT, going for a promotion, getting certifications, etc.), please consider: 

* Not everyone’s job pays OT/has extra hours available or this just isn’t applicable. Think teacher, assistant, etc. 
* Sometimes promotions aren’t possible
* Not everyone is in love with their main job and people might want to do something different for diversity’s sake or for fun while earning some money. From u/sachin571

&#x200B;

It's a controversial episode to say the least. My first reaction was to feel angst and a bit of disenchantment with what Suze says about FIRE and how 1, 2, or 3 million dollars isn't enough. It took the wind out of my sails for a few minutes until hearing her go to such an extreme with saying expenses could hit a million a year, etc. It's hard to hear someone who is worth $50 million+ rant about how one can't live responsibly on $80,000/yr in order to prioritize freedom, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Fortunately, the FIRE community provides solid data, tools, methods and a community to support the mentality that Paula summarizes so well in the last 10 minutes of the episode.

I'm sure Paula would appreciate if most commentary and discussion would take place on her blog, FB, or Instagram, but I just thought I'd get the ball rolling with this amazing community.

I know it's awesome because I've done it, in several different countries.

But I find that most of the blog posts or articles you read about this alternative lifestyle plan are misrepresentative at best and half full-of-shit at worst.

They're either:

A. Geared towards wealthier retirees looking to ""slum it"" on US$4000/month. Quoting the price of beer in Bangalore at $3 because that's what you pay for a Bud Light and presuming you'd rather go hungry than eat at a local-style restaurant.

or...

B. List ridiculously low monthly budgets to make anyone with more than $10,000 in the bank say, ""MAN! Did you know it only costs $5/day to live in paradise? I could retire immediately.""

For this particular rant I am going to dispel the falsities purported by Type B.

**Only the truly devoted hippie can stand the test of time of living like a local long-term.**

There's a certain segment of the demographic in here who really do live the *rice and beans* dream. Who live a life so free of epicurean delights that a slice of lemon in their glass is the only upgrade from tap water they'll ever need.

But most of us are after an existence that's a bit more comfortable.

Not superfluous and wasteful but comfortable enough that we'd want to splurge on Burger King once in a while even if street Phở can be purchased with change found in the sofa.

And instead of sitting on the floor...we'd like that coin-collecting sofa.

**So the next time you read an article that makes the cost-of-living elsewhere sound out-of-this-world unrealistic, realize that it probably is.**

Here are a list of realistic expenses that are generally missing:

- **Cost of traveling home.** Most people will want to go home every year or two to visit family & friends. The cost of returning to the first world for even 2-3 weeks can easily be equivalent to 2-4 months of your third world budget.

- **Same goes for pleasure travel.** If you like living overseas then you are likely a travel addict, too. Remember that planning to live on $800-1000/month ad infinitum means that you'll only be traveling to shoestring budget countries for the rest of your life. 

- **Food.** Even when the local food and drink is amazing, you won't want to eat every meal this way. You'll want this imported cheese or that cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving or a sixer of your favorite beer or dinner at the Thai place or a better quality pizza or whatever. You'll easily spend 3-4 times what a local does on food each month (estimate) in the developing world, one way or another.

- **Luxury goods cost more.** Computers, appliances, tools, etc. Any of the stuff not owned by poor people will cost more overseas than you're used to paying at home (particularly if you're American)...there's a long list of things that non-wealthy locals do without that you'll likely want. Expect to pay more for these luxury goods.

- **Cheap labor often sucks.** You get what you pay for when it comes to labor/services...so sometimes you'll have to pay more to get a level of service to your satisfaction. If you want a painter that doesn't get paint all over the floor, this costs more than the standard market rate. Same story for low-cost health care...if you have a cold then Dr. Simi is a godsend...but if you need surgery you'll likely need to go to a big city and pay more to visit an international hospital or similar.

- **Same goes for quality anything, really.** Quality costs money in the developing world...and as worldly as you think you are, you'll likely be wanting to upgrade a lot more things from the ""local"" style than you'd imagine. Even quality pet food will cost you nearly double what you pay at home.

- **Charity.** Despite the fact that you're not wealthy by YOUR standards, you will be wealthy by local standards. As such, it only makes sense that organizations will ask you to pitch in financially for fixing up the school or for the local festival, etc.

- **Clothing.** If you're at all non-average sized, you'll have a hard time buying shoes/clothes that fit overseas. 

- **Real Estate.** In many cases the rents listed on these cheapo blog posts are for tiny apartments in neighborhoods where most foreigners wouldn't want to live. 

- **Currency fluctuation, inflation and long-term COL.** The younger you are the more you need to wonder what the COL will look like 10, 20 or 30 years from now in your new home. There are ways to mitigate and hedge this risk but presuming little volatility in the world's most volatile places is foolish....and this is exactly what these ""retire on $1000/month"" articles insinuate.

This isn't to say that there aren't super LCOL destinations out there...there are...and it's great to go out for dinner and drinks and not even check the menu to see if beers are $1 or $1.25...but anyone seriously considering the lifestyle needs to do more than take the listed monthly budget in *Country X* and multiply it by 12...you'll spend more than that and probably significantly more.",financialindependence

827,28 Year Old Retires in NYC With Over $2 Million! In depth fact analysis.,,928,7wy2l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7wy2l3/28_year_old_retires_in_nyc_with_over_2_million_in/,1518407366.0,"I came across this article from Forbes this weekend where a 28 year old woman (JP Livingston) retired with 2.25 million with in just 7 years. She also runs her own blog now ([Money habit](http://www.themoneyhabit.org)) and has been featured by several new websites (CNN, Business insider). I tried to dig deeper to learn her methods and what I found out will surprise you!!

&nbsp;

Facts from her blog and newspaper articles:

She goes by the pen name of JP Livingston (a.k.a JP) in her blogs and news articles. 

She finished college in 3 years by age 19. She chose ~~UCLA over Harvard~~ Harvard over UCLA although she had merit scholarships at UCLA.  There is some conflicting information about her student debt. Her blog says she saved 150K in tuition fees and potential missed income by graduating one year early. But according to CNBC she graduated from Harvard with zero debt.

She then moves to Mongolia to serve as a horse trekking assistant. At age 21 she moves back to the US and started working in an investment form in NYC.
She started with a starting salary of 60K plus a 40 K bonus the first year. She then goes on to get several bonuses and gets a 30% increase in base pay annually. She then claims she had 1 million by 26 (2014) and then 2.25 million by age 28 (in 2016) 
According to the CNBC article she received several raises in the years following and by the end of her career she was making mid -six figures. (Retired in 7 years in 2008)


&nbsp;

Other key facts:

1. Saved more than 70% of her income annually.
2. She was living on 25,000 per year when she started
3. She was getting raises of 30% annually
4. Out of 2.25 million, 40% came from investing and 60% came from savings.
5. Her savings were invested in low cost mutual funds (S&P 500)
6. She now lives with her husband in NYC with an annual budget of ~65K per year 

&nbsp;


What’s suspicious:
&nbsp;

1. She went to Harvard and graduated with ZERO debt according to the news article!! This contradicts what she mentions in her blog.

2. She initially started her financial blog in 2016 and stated she retired at age 28. There is absolutely no information as to how she made her money nor how it grew to 2.25 million in just 7 years. There is not a single fact or figure regarding this in any of her blogposts or the news articles she is featured in. 

3. In November 2016, she is featured in an article in Forbes which is the first time the 2 million is mentioned. But the article lacks any specific information. Once this article is written JP updates her website to add the 2 million. There are some photographs of JP’s apartment but not her photo. She seems to be living in a small 325 sq. foot apartment in NYC now.  

4. In December 2016, the same new reporter from Forbes (Maya Kachroo-Levine) writes an article with JP where they talk about how she is investing in 2017. Again, no mention of how she made the 2.25 million in just 7 years. 

5. This news then snowballs and there are several articles about JP on Business Insider (03/17), CNN (08/17), CNBC (02/18). All these articles are again really vague with no substance. There is still no mention of how she made her 2.25 million. At best, it looks like a promotion for her blogpost. Not one article had her photograph or proof that she really made 2.25 milltion.

6. Her traffic for the blogpost shot up dramatically from 01/17. Few weeks after she was featured on Forbes. Makes me wonder if all this was just to spread the word about her website. 

7. I have made an excel spread sheet with her finances based on the limited information gathered from the blog and news articles. I will summarize it here 

&nbsp;

Year 1 - (2010) - Made 100k (60k salary, 40k bonus), 401 K – 16.5K, expenses 25K, post tax ~40K, Net balance (NB) 60000 

Year 2 - (2011) - Made ~78K (after 30% hike in annual salary yearly). NB 97K

Year 3 - (2012) - Made ~101K, NB 172

Year 4 - (2013) - Made ~131K NB 319

Year 5 - (2014) - Made ~171K, NB 467, According to one article she had 1 million in 2014!! A difference of 532K between stated and calculated

Year 6 - (2015) - Made ~222K, NB 596K

Year 7 - (2016) - Made ~289K, NB 844K. According to the news articles she retired in 2016 with 2.25 million. So, a difference of 1.4 million between calculated income and her stated income.    

Please note that based on her 30% hike in salary annually she wouldn’t reach 2.25 million until mid 2019. 

&nbsp;

However, she claims that she retired with a mid 6 figure salary. Let’s assume she made 500K the last 3 years before retirement, she would still only retire with 1.4 million in 2016.

&nbsp;

Why I wrote this:
&nbsp;

1) I had a lot of down time this weekend. :)

2) I aspire to retire early too but this blog turned out to be too good to be true with no real facts.

3) I was surprised that some really good news networks like Forbes, CNN and CNBC write things without researching the topic well enough.

4) It infuriates me that JP has been able to fool so many people into believing that she was able to retire in 7 years with 2.25 million. This seems to be a false claim!  Based on her blogs, it does look like she works in the financial industry. But making false claims to promote her blog is unfair to the millions of people who wish to retire early!

5) And I learnt so much about finances by doing this research this weekend!!!

&nbsp;

**Please let me know what your thoughts are on this?**

I found this community back in 2015 and it's helped me tremendously in my journey to get here.  I now religiously check in everyday to see the latest posts.

Here's a quick rundown:  33M, living in HCOL city, and making 81k.  I first moved here and was making $12/hr with infrequent temp work.  I was hemorrhaging money from left over student loans and also had help from my parents.  After that 1st year I was able to get a job in my field making 57k.  This was actually a solid baseline salary.  I was able to have my own studio, pay student loans, and still have fun.  After about 1.5 years I switched jobs and am now making 81k.  I did my best to avoid lifestyle inflation and have been doubling up my student loan payments since then.  You can slightly notice the change in the graph from where I started my new job.

Things I done well so far in my journey:  I've never had credit card debt.  My only debt is student loans.  And I think I've done well at avoiding lifestyle inflation and increasing my savings rate.

Things I need to work on:  EATING OUT.  I do it far to often and really need to get it back.  But that's a work in progress.

Here's my chart over the last 2.5 years.  Thanks for all your help.  https://imgur.com/a/oSRoT",financialindependence

She has some good people on her side but the VP just has too much juice.  He is going to bulldoze everyone.  In all likelihood the parent organization is going to dissolve the smaller company she is in and absorb it, despite significant legal hurdles.  She is looking at a maximum of 9 months of employment there.  Sometimes you gamble and win big.  Sometimes you just have to walk away.  But, she sold 2 houses yesterday and both of those are 90% likely to lead to another listing each.  Those 4 sales cover almost a year of our living expenses.  Not exactly the amazing ""told off my boss and suddenly I AM the boss"" FU stories everyone wants to hear.  But we will be perfectly fine.  

original post:  

We’ve been in track for a few years with a pretty good starting place of no consumer debt. 
We both started real estate side jobs and bought rentals etc. she makes the best salary but between side hustle money and my salary we don’t strictly need her job anymore and we can still continue to save. 

There is some turmoil at her work and a VP a few levels up but not directly in her line has been meddling in her department and she decided she had to freedom to call his shit like she saw it.  This has really gotten the attention of other VPs and the board.   It could go very well or very bad. Either she is a badass who is going to climb or she is on her way out. Either way she is happy. 

If she was still a basic paycheck person she would have kept her head down and dealt with the downhill slope of garbage headed her way. 

Exciting times in our house.

Edit to head off questions:
I make 50k salary
She makes 75k salary
I flip houses and make about 75k annually
She is a real estate agent and makes 150k at that

We are in a LCOL area. Combined net worth of maybe 300k.


Edit 2:
We have significant real estate holdings not included in ‘net worth’ because the contracts  are structured such that it is hard to value or are illiquid.   ‘Net worth’ should be ‘investment accounts’. 

I also have a defined benefit pension fully vested and our cash flow would let us coast to being able to draw that. 

If I have a house I’m flipping and I have a purchase price of 100k and 20k in repairs but I think it will sell for 160 in a month I just don’t count that in NW because it doesn’t fit the FI reddit model.  is that 120 or 160?  I’ll roll that money into another flip and in theory it could evaporate with a bad deal. 

Edit 3:

Let me restate the financial position. 
50k salary
75k salary
150k agent income 
75k flip income
300k in brokerage accounts
I have a pension plan coming that will pay 3k a month forever at age 55. 
Our rental income stream is roughly 3k a month but rising quickly as we focus our income on new acquisitions and paying down debt. Thus the small stock portfolio. 
Real estate portfolio equity is 500-1mil, depending on how you value it.   Not all of it is straight forward- And there is a lot of churn.   I don’t like to include this in my NW because of how it is structured. Some of the value is based on low cap rates and that equity doesn’t feel real to me.  

Our base monthly costs are $3000, give or take.  So technically we could quit our jobs tomorrow and live off of 3k a month, but that is a little lean for us and we have youngish kids so I feel the need to double the ‘passive’ income because I recognize tastes change, kids have needs and I want to leave an estate. 


Edit 4:  she reported back tonight. VP threatened to basically dissolve and absorb her division. He sent an email out stating that he was going to do that ‘immediately’. The board recognized there were massive regulatory/legal hurdles to this and VP was being insane. He had to walk it back ala Trump. She talked to her board contact who basically said ‘good job standing up for yourself.  Nobody is going to touch you any time soon.’ 

She has a job for at least another year, but honestly we hope he keeps meddling and they offer to buy her contract out.   Her board is made up of very HNWI and I suspect one or more may try to poach her for their businesses as her contract winds down. 

Hopefully this also sparks some scrutiny of crazy VP who has being doing some shady- but not illegal- stuff. 

Bonus:  she is sitting on the couch next to me listing a house for sale.  We both recognize that leaving her job to be an agent isn’t retired by any stretch. But is it a gamble and we have the money to gamble without much fear.",financialindependence

I recently read David Graeber's *Bullshit Jobs: A Theory* (2018) and came to the belated realisation that after more than a decade in the workforce, I’ve really only had bullshit jobs. For those of you who aren’t familiar with the concept, here are some snippets from the book:

&gt; A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

&gt; Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They’re just pointless. Shit jobs are usually not at all bullshit; they typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society; it’s just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly.

&gt; … we have established three broad categories of jobs: useful jobs (which may or may not be shit jobs), bullshit jobs, and a small but ugly penumbra of jobs such as gangsters, slumlords, top corporate lawyers, or hedge fund CEOs, made up of people who are basically just selfish bastards and don’t really pretend to be anything else. The three-part list is not meant to be comprehensive. 

&gt; Those who work bullshit jobs are often surrounded by honor and prestige; they are respected as professionals, well paid, and treated as high achievers – as the sort of people who can be justly proud of what they do. Yet secretly they are aware that they have achieved nothing; they feel they have done nothing to earn the consumer toys with which they fill their lives; they feel it’s all based on a lie – as, indeed, it is.

See also Graeber’s [original essay](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs) on the subject.

It’s not that I’ve ever sought out bullshit jobs. Bullshit just came and found me. Over the years I tried a few different lines of work, even pursued lower paying public sector jobs in the hope of finding something worthwhile. They all turned out to be bullshit, the sort where I was just ticking a box or plagiarising someone else’s work for a report noone would read (“intellectual masturbation”). At this point in my career – if you can even call it that – I’ve pretty much lost all hope that I will ever find a well-paying non-bullshit job. 

Of course I’m not saying that well-paying non-bullshit jobs don’t exist, just that statistically I’m not likely to get one. I suspect my jobs have been consistently bullshit partly because I don’t have any real specialist knowledge and skills (the knowledge to be a doctor, for example) and partly because I’ve naturally gravitated to higher paying jobs (bullshit jobs tend to pay better than shit jobs). I also haven’t been driven enough to get a really high-powered  job (Graeber’s third category), the sort where you dispense with the pretense that you’re not a selfish bastard.

**My bullshit job**

I’m currently a risk analyst in a global financial institution. My job is ostensibly to produce risk reports for internal and external consumption but because of my employer’s conflicts of interests, I’m discouraged from doing any real analysis. I understand the existence of my job to serve two purposes: (1) to tick a box so that the organisation can say we’ve analysed the risks, and (2) to increase the team’s headcount and thereby boost my bosses’ standing in the organisation. It’s a classic bullshit job.

The downsides: 

* The organisation is highly hierarchical and I have little control over my work. Anything I write can be changed at any time by managers who have very little knowledge of the subject matter. This is obviously very frustrating and I now deal with it by putting minimal effort into any work. 

* The culture in my team is poisonous. Employees rarely get fired and generally don’t leave (on account of being overpaid) so there’s little chance the culture will improve. I’m sickened by the falseness and the relentless office politics.

* The job is 90% pointless. I’m a parasite on society and whatever skills I had in my field have atrophied. The perverse reality is that I would actually be more happy in my role if I didn’t have any related skills or knowledge, since then I wouldn’t know right from wrong.

The upside:

* By cutting corners, I’ve managed to find carve out at least half of my work week for my own projects, mostly reading books and playing computer games at my desk. Thankfully I have my own office.

**FIRE**

My personal circumstance: in my mid-30s and married in Shanghai, China with two small children. We’ve always tried to live frugally, although obviously many people in our city get by on much less. Our basic stats (in USD): 

* Income: $238k p.a. (75% is from my bullshit job)

* Spending: $46k p.a.

* Net worth: $1.6m, including $800k equities, $240k cash and fixed income, $1m real estate (no car, no other retirement accounts) and $440k debt (mostly home loan)

It looks like on paper we’re close to being able to FIRE but there are some important things holding us back:

* We’re fortunate in being able to keep expenses low living in Shanghai but I don’t imagine that this will continue indefinitely. I’m sure costs will increase as the kids grow up and we do plan to eventually move to a country with HCOL, e.g. UK, US, Australia. 

* I’m very concerned about future long-term returns given the current state of financial markets.

* We don’t yet have a concrete plan on what we’d do if we were to retire early. 

It occurs to me that my job (and other bullshit jobs) could be a potentially good way to reach FIRE, despite their many downsides. This is especially the case if my assumption is that any other job I’m likely to find will probably be bullshit as well. 

Anyone else currently in or been in a similar position? Would appreciate any thoughts or advice, thanks.

Edit 1: It’s heartening to hear that many others are in the same boat. And thanks to those who injected some much-needed perspective. For those in low-paying bullshit jobs or low-paying shit jobs, burdened with personal debt, I feel for you. To me, it all underscores the importance of FIRE, both as a journey (since it gives meaning to our daily struggles) and as an end goal (since it frees us from both shit and bullshit). 

I found the following replies especially insightful, as they go to the core of my and others' interest in FIRE:

u/CannonballUnder26:
&gt; I thought about this some more, and I gotta wonder, would anyone even bother with FIRE if it weren’t for bullshit jobs and neoliberalism? I don’t think many doctors and nurses pursue FIRE beyond just having an emergency fund and a safety net to catch themselves in lieu of a social welfare state. There aren’t many blue collar folks trying to get into RE, unless disability forces them to. I think this goes beyond a cultural difference, and is actually a manifestation of them recognizing their work has value, while ours does not.
These really are fundamentally tied phenomena, in my opinion. Many of us want to quit our soul sucking corporate bullshit jobs and focus on more purposeful work. “RE” isn’t usually about being an idle rich parasite for fifty years. It’s about freedom from bullshit. 

u/dlxw:
&gt; No one wants to stay in the “shit job” layer where the actual work gets done, because true to its name your autonomy goes to shit, and then you start producing shit, and feeling like shit because of it. You try to get yourself out of it, and maybe you do some good work that stands on its own, but the more traction that work gets the more you get invited to the “important” meeting and the more you realize all anyone is doing there is talking in circles spouting bullshit. But you’re comfortable and start getting paid more, and that just turns you into a bullshitter. The sad fact is that 95% of the human effort in that company gets devoted to coming up with bullshit strategies that create busywork for the shit layer, who is busy trying to ignore the bullshit and actually build and fix things. Then if you’re lucky, somewhere in the pipeline someone with a shit job, or a bullshitter who periodically descends into the shit layer to do some real work, is actually turning out good shit :) and that carries the whole company.

&gt; … When an entire economic model lionizes “letting your money work for you” as a virtuous model of productivity, it stands to reason that the highest paid jobs closest to that faucet will revolve around legitimizing this system, creating the appearance of very difficult important work that is actually just moving some money and labor around between people who have shit jobs. You are an interface, a buffer between the true bastards and the people working shit jobs, creating the justification for extracting labor from the shit layer to hand profit to the bastards.

&gt; FIRE mentality can certainly become complicit in this (by basing an entire lifestyle around investment income) but I think the critical component is the work you will be free to do when you FIRE and no longer have to worry about the time investment of the bullshit job. I don’t see FIRE as a way to stop working; this world is too wonderful and broken to sit by doing nothing but subsisting on a pile of money. I *want* to work on useful things, which as he notes are often shit jobs, but with autonomy, where I am not just being crushed by bullshitters and only do the parts of the job I think are important. cleaning your neighborhood, caring for others, learning new skills like art, feeding people, raising kids, writing etc is all low paid shit work *when turned into jobs directed by bullshitters*, but i think is the most personally fulfilling thing I could do, and the actual work that would make society a better place. So my hope (we’ll see how it goes) is to FIRE from my bullshit job and spend the time doing the work that actually makes life better.

Going forward I will probably do what u/LiveFastFiYoung does:
&gt; I spend maybe 15-20 hours a week on actual work, and spend the rest of the time in my workshop or writing. Those things keep me motivated and I dread having to send another pointless email that won't be read. I could likely go find another bullshit tech job that would pay slightly less that would have me working even less, but I guess I will coast until I can finally quit.

Edit 2: I just heard that David Graeber passed away yesterday, the same day as this post. *Bullshit jobs* was the last book he wrote. A great loss for the world to have lost such an original mind. RIP.",financialindependence

2016: 363 k NW, 110 k pay

2017: 591 k NW, 120 k estimated pay





I've lived beneath my means, biked to work, etc. But I had a few extra pushes along the way.

1. My job payed for most of my food, as I was usually travelling in and out of the villages.


2. a 10% match on my 401k. So I could usually max it out by putting in 20% ($17500ish) and the company would usually match about $8,000. The numbers were always a bit hazy due to my hourly position and frequent overtime.

3. Since I was rarely in town I bought a bit of land and built a dry cabin on it. I estimate I saved nearly 100k with that alone.

I'm on track for about 2900 hours for the year and 120k depending on how the next few months go.


But that's it. I swore I'd keep this job till I got to 600 k, I turned in my 2 months notice and am going back to college next semester.

I wasn't a good student when I was younger, had a lot of growing up to do. I just wanted to throw out an example of someone attempting FIRE with just a high school diploma.


It sounds corny but what really got me into FIRE is this comic http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722

That's the story so far, full time college starts soon and while I'm sure I'll keep reading this sub I doubt I'll have much to contribute until my next career fires up.

I'm positing that this is a valuable discussion topic because I've seen confusion on this sub about how Social Security works and whether or not you should even consider it in your FIRE plans. Given that many people here plan on retiring early, I think it's helpful to understand the eligibility requirements and mechanisms of the program.

**Disclaimer**: There are many contexts I'm not considering here, like teachers who pay into a pension system instead of Social Security. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone in the private sector in the US for their whole career. I'm not covering non-US citizens who have paid into Social Security or US citizens who worked abroad. Finally, I am not an expert, I'm just an internet stranger who has read a bit about the program. If I got something wrong, please correct me in the comments, we're all striving for a more perfect understanding.

# What is Social Security?

It's officially called **Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance**. For the purposes of this discussion, I'll focus on the old-age part. It is **not** a retirement vehicle where your individual contributions are placed for your later withdrawal, rather it functions more like a [QLAC (qualified longevity annuity contract)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_insurance), but with a strong tilt toward social safety net. It was officially signed into law in 1935 with an aim of reducing poverty among the elderly. 

From recent [CBPP research](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-keeps-22-million-americans-out-of-poverty-a-state-by-state) on Social Security and poverty:

> Without Social Security, the poverty rate for those aged 65 and over would meet or exceed 40 percent in one-third of states; with Social Security, it is less than 10 percent in two-thirds of states.

Alternatively an [excerpt from the PGPF](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2018/09/what-effect-does-social-security-have-on-poverty):

> Social Security drastically reduced poverty for the elderly. Without income from Social Security, two thirds of the elderly would be considered poor. Social Security reduced the poverty rate to 16 percent in 2008.


# How are benefits determined?

### Credits

To be eligible for Social Security you need a minimum of 40 ""credits"". As of 2020 you earn a credit for every $1,410 with a maximum of 4 credits per year. So if you make at least $5,640 / year (in today's dollars) for ten years then you're eligible. In keeping with the spirit of the program there's a low barrier to qualify for the most basic level of benefits.

### Averaged Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

Social Security keeps track of your eligible annual earnings. When calculating your benefits, they will count your top 35 years. If you've worked less than 35 years, you've got zeros counting against you. Past years earnings are adjusted for inflation by using multiplier values which the SSA [maintains a list](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/retirebenefit1.html) of.

Your AIME is then calculated by taking the adjusted total of those highest 35 years of earnings, dividing by 35, and then dividing by 12.

So if your total indexed earnings were $1,000,000 as of today, your AIME would be:
$1,000,000 / 35 / 12 = $2,380

### Income caps

Social Security places a cap on how much of your annual earnings count towards your AIME, in 2020 this cap is $137,700. It doesn't matter if you earn more, this is maximum value that will go into your earnings history for the year. That may sound unfair at first brush, but past this point you also stop paying Social Security taxes on income.

### Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

Now we get to the part people really care about, your AIME is translated into a PIA through a formula. PIA is what your monthly payment would be at full retirement age.

How does this formula work? You can read it from the source [here](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html). The short of it is that there are two bend points in the PIA curve, you can think of it as three brackets where each bracket gives you a worse return than its predecessor.

For AIME <= $960, you get 90% income replacement

For AIME > $960 and <= $5,785 you get 32% income replacement

For AIME > $5,785 you get 15% income replacement

---

This is where the social safety net behavior becomes most apparent, it's easy to qualify for the first $864 in monthly social security benefits since you get 90 cents on the dollar, but progressing beyond this is much slower going as you pass the first bend point and slower still when you hit the second bend point.

---

Let's run an example, carrying over our $2,380 AIME from earlier:

$960 * .9 = $864

$1,420 * .32 = $454

$0 * .15 = $0

= $1,318

This mean Social Security would pay you $1,318 a month at 67. There's a whole different calculation for starting benefits earlier or later which decreases or increases your payments, but I'll leave that for another discussion.

# RIP Social Security

### Isn't Social Security running out of money?

I hear this a lot. Invariably when Social Security comes up in the daily thread you'll see some people say they don't even count it because they don't think it'll be around when they retire. It's true that Social Security is paying out more money than it takes in but this is a [recent development](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v75n1/v75n1p1.html). Over the last few decades the program actually ran an overall surplus which went into a trust fund and was [invested into treasury securities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/policy-basics-understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds). That trust fund has $2.9 trillion dollars. 

You'll see [people say that Social Security went into a deficit in 2010](https://www.heritage.org/social-security/heritage-explains/the-state-social-security), which is true on a taxes in vs benefits out basis, but that ignores the interest income that Social Security receives from its invested trust fund assets. Up until 2020 or 2021, that interest income has been enough to make up the shortfall. Unfortunately this means Social Security is now starting to eat its nest egg.

Under current projections, the trust fund has enough money to [allow full payouts until 2034](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html). But what about after that, game over?

Not quite, if the trust fund is fully depleted, Social Security will only be able to pay out in benefits what it receives in taxes. As of right now, that's projected to be about 77 cents on the dollar. What that means is, if nothing else happens between now and trust fund depletion, you'll take a 23% haircut on your projected benefits. That's not great, but it's a far cry from the whole system imploding.

### No, seriously, I heard Social Security was going to explode

Every so often someone will write a [scary story](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/08/social-securitys-looming-32-trillion-shortfall.html) with obscenely large numbers. These are almost invariably based on the infinite horizon projections in the annual [Social Security trustees report](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2019/). 

The infinite horizon projection takes the 75 year projection and extends it into infinity. If this sounds like it might not produce sane numbers, [many actuaries agree with you](https://www.actuary.org/content/actuarial-perspective-2018-social-security-trustees-report-0):

> The infinite horizon projections project all annual balances beyond 75 years assuming that the current law, demographic assumptions, and economic trends from the 75-year projection continue indefinitely; in practice, this is highly problematic. Projections over an infinite time period have an extremely high degree of uncertainty. Troublesome inconsistencies can arise among demographic and program-specific assumptions. By assuming that longevity keeps increasing forever while retirement ages remain static, for example, the infinite time period forecast will eventually result in an extremely long period of retirement.

# What's FIRE got to do with it?

That was all interesting, but what are the takeaways for someone interested in FIRE? 

### Make sure you're eligible

First and foremost, get those 40 credits! Unless you strike it very rich early on, it's a good hedge to make sure you're eligible for at least the basic levels of Social Security benefits. You're hopefully looking at a long retirement and these payments may help considerably twenty or thirty years down the line.

### Max out the first segment of the PIA curve

If you work for at least ten years and make >= $40k / year, you'll both qualify for Social Security benefits and fill up the first (and most generous) part of the PIA curve. For most people here it'll probably just happen as a matter of course.

### Be realistic about Social Security

It's extremely conservative to entirely exclude Social Security from your plans. Pricing in a haircut seems prudent. Even if political action is taken to shore up finances, it may have the same net effect to a well-off FIRE person (i.e. heavier taxation of benefits, means testing, etc). I'd be wary of simply taking the stated monthly benefits you see now at face value if your benefits are more than 10 years out.

### A couple of naive strategies

Here are two different ways I've thought of Social Security over the years in my plans. I'm not presenting these as recommendations or fully formed plans, but providing them as an example.

##### Safe withdrawal rate

Goal: Boost your starting SWR by accounting for your eventual Social Security benefits

ERN has an [interesting write-up](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/07/19/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-17-social-security/) that discusses accounting for Social Security cash flows when planning your safe withdrawal rate. Admittedly he does not think it changes much for very early retirees, but depending on when you retire and what your expected benefits are, Social Security can have a non-trivial impact on your SWR.

##### Longevity insurance

Goal: Guard against an unexpectedly long life

In this scenario you're mostly planning on your own funds to see you through your early retirement, and you want to maximize the cash flow from Social Security in the event that you somehow live to 90 or beyond. In this case you'd want to defer your benefits as long as possible (70 years old) to increase the monthly benefit. The downside to this approach is that if you don't live that long (say you keel over at 75), you've made a sub optimal choice with regard to total payout. In the context of insurance though, this is could be a fair trade-off. A QLAC or deferred annuity is a more straightforward proposition for such hedging but for most people Social Security is mandatory anyway.

### Be aware of your progress

You can check on your current credits, AIME and PIA by plugging your numbers into [https://ssa.tools/](https://ssa.tools/). I've got no connection with this page, I just think its a nifty tool. You can get your numbers by signing into your [ssa.gov account](https://www.ssa.gov/). 

**Note**: If you're just signing up for an ssa.gov account, be aware that they need to pull your credit information from Equifax to verify your identity, so if you've frozen your credit with Equifax, you'll actually have to do a temporary lift before applying. Yes, everything about that last sentence is ridiculous.

From their [account creation page](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/create.html):

> If you have a security freeze, fraud alert, or both on your credit report, you can still open a my Social Security account by temporarily lifting it.

### Spousal benefits

Another fun tip is that if you're married and your partner has a much lower income and / or becomes a stay at home parent, you can look into [spousal benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/applying6.html). This lets your partner receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of your own regardless of their work record. Obviously you'd want to crunch the numbers to see if your partner is eligible for a larger benefit based on their own earnings history.

### Retiring abroad

Retiring abroad is a common theme amongst a certain segment of the FIRE population. 

SSA provides a [full page](https://www.ssa.gov/international/payments.html) of information regarding receiving payments while outside the US. The short answer is that if you're a US citizen who is eligible for benefits, you should be able to get your payments regardless of where you live, so long as that where isn't North Korea or Cuba. They even provide a [guided questionnaire](https://www.ssa.gov/international/payments_outsideUS.html) to help you determine if payments will work in your specific situation.

# Conclusion

At the end of the day, Social Security is a safety net more than it is a retirement mechanism. Its goal is to help cash strapped seniors make ends meet, not support a great or even good retirement on its own. For many people here, however, it represents a non-trivial cash flow on the back end of their retirement and it shouldn't be dismissed lightly. 

Don't assume Social Security will look or pay the same 30 years from now. On the flip side there would be objectively bad outcomes for a significant portion of the elderly population if it went belly up. I could be wrong, but I don't think eliminating Social Security would be a popular political agenda.

That's about as long a wall of text as I am willing to write, and probably longer than most people are willing to read. For those of you that did read it through, I hope it helped.",financialindependence

* the conversation starts with something related to you (say what you are drinking or reading)

* then they ask what you do for a living

* and when you ask them what they do, that's when they introduce this FIRE couple they met and how they are mentoring them to do the same

* eventually they ask if you want to stay in your current job for much longer and if you show some interest in changing, they offer to put you in contact with their FIRE couple

I'm pretty sure this is a scam of some sort, due to the fact I've been approached and heard the exact same story from multiple people and they have asked me the exact same sequence of questions (they must be following a script).

It just doesn't come up. A lot of the time I think FI/RE is just an excuse for people to brag to others about how much money they have. There's no benefit in making others jealous or feel small because of your bank account.

My goal was to hit 100k net worth not counting any home equity before I turned 26, and I hit it 6 months before. I also wanted to put this out there because I don't see too many people in my income range(55k) making these posts, most seem to have significantly higher, so I thought I would share. 

Here are the numbers:

* 401k - 51,974
* Roth IRA - 36,872
* Cash - 15,011
* HSA - 1,512

Again I didn't want to take into account any home equity, but that is the only debt I currently have with $158,748 for a home valued at $202,000. Spending 40k on a down payment after working so hard to save up that much was tough.

I just want to say reading a lot of the other posts and successes on here have kept me on target for a long while. It felt really hard at times when I would watch some of my peers driving brand new trucks and sports cars around that they shouldn't be financing and I'm rolling up in my 14 year old Accord. I know down the line though I will be in a much better position, so thanks for the positive reinforcement!

EDIT: Adding info that a lot of people have asked for and stuff to make post clearer.

* Big thing that allowed me to save so much early was I went to college tuition free due to a parent being a professor at said college. Also stayed at home during this time and worked around 30 hours a week.

* Graduated with Comp Sci degree and was offered Jr DBA position at same company I interned with in college. Still there.

* Retirement accounts are invested in index funds. ROTH IRA is Vanguard VTSAX, 401k is what was available under my plan, but is basically S&P 500 index.

* 401k match at current company is very strong. We get a profit sharing match of either 1.00, 1.35, or 1.5 of 6% contributions as well as defined contribution of either 6%, 8%, or 10% depending on time with company.

* Live with Fiance so we split bills on everything. We do keep our finances separate though so none of this includes her numbers. She is a public school teacher though so does make decent wage and once we get married I will be going on her much better health plan.",financialindependence

We could reach $250-300k for that down payment over the next 4-5 years, but part of me wonders whether we should just plan to rent forever, invest in index funds, and if there's a good opportunity 5+ years down the line, we can buy a home then.

At the same time, we do have a goal of retiring early, and we're not sure what path to take that will get us there. Or perhaps we could rent until early retirement, and settle down in a cheaper area.

We've been doing a lot of reflecting about what we want ourselves, and we're seeking if anyone else had personal experiences with similar situations with rent vs. buy, where they may have settled on renting (when buying was also an option), or vice versa, and found that it was worth it for them (whether in a financial or emotional sense.)",financialindependence

* Kid = child. There is no distancing in using the word kid. Maybe it's local/family vernacular. It's just what we say. She's my little angel.
* Mother of my child because that's what she is. I can't say wife because she isn't. We may not be lovebirds anymore, but we're still dating. 
* Clothes. One redditor mentioned maybe he treats it like a uniform. That's what I do. I went from an actual required uniform to doing whatever I want. I work in a machine shop out back almost every day. So it's carpenter's jeans and a sweater. Yes, I bathe and wear fresh underclothes. Wow.
* Hair. I went from $10/hr with a required high 'n' tight to doing whatever I want. So I'm growing it out (and trying to escape a mid-life crisis receding hairline). 
* You should have paid it off sooner. I went from $10/hr in 2012 to $80k annum 2013 to $150k annum 2014. I had a lot of debt repair to do in those first good years. 

I follow this sub regularly, but I wouldn't say I'm actively on FIRE. I save/invest heavily in my retirement accounts, but have a leisurely enough lifestyle as-is that I don't think I'll retire earlier than say my 50's. I'm 36 now.

I'm extremely frugal in some areas (haven't bothered with a haircut in almost a year, wear the same exact clothes every day (minus underclothes)) and borderline excessive in others (my one true hobby is my little airplane that cost me $30,000). 

Everything else either is reinvested into my self-owned business, retirement or my kid. 

Having said that, I live in a very low COL area, but make about $130k. That's serious money out here. The mother of my kid lives with me and fends for herself as far as her bills go. The big bills (mortgage, utilities) I handle. What's funny is I can run this company anywhere in the country. In SF or NYC, that $130k won't go very far. This was key for....

Buying a brick ranch starter home 1/1/2007 for $64k at 6% fixed. Nice quiet dead end street in the city, lots of kids running around, most of the time the neighbors aren't morons. Typical American Dream.

Almost 11 years to the day, I have it knocked out. I ignored offer after offer to refinance at around 3% because I knew this day was coming soon and there was no point in going through the paperwork headache to save maybe $200 in interest (providing I had it paid off when I thought I would). 

If you really dig through my trollish post history, you'll find the random post here and there where I ask if it's better to pay off the house or invest heavily. Most redditors said to invest and keep plugging away at the loan.

I've always patently disagreed with that. The house is now mine. Free and clear. My insurance and taxes **combined** don't equal $1500/yr. As an old boss once told me, ""Always worry about your house first. You get that paid off and it doesn't matter what happens to you financially."" 

I took that to heart, especially with my current business. My income could dry up at a moment's notice and I'm basically unemployable otherwise. It always just made sense to get a guaranteed roof over my family's heads. 

**TLDR**: Bought $64k house 1/1/2007 making what is probably min wage now. Paid off yesterday after bumping up to low-mid $100k's in 2014. Also, I'm apparently an aspergers-riddled hermit. ",financialindependence

Wanted to share my tale, as I love reading success stories and my journey has some twist and turns. Some details are obfuscated to protect my innocence :) 

### Some Background
2004 - Start in internship (during transition between High School and College) with a large defense contractor. My salary for an intern is great ($18/hr) and I'm given retirement benefits. Immediately start sinking 25% into my 401k.

2008 - Graduate college with a degree in Engineering. The job market sucks, and I take a few months off to backpack around Europe and Africa.

2009 - Come back to my HCOL city and start working as a government contractor. Salary is $55k. I'm fortunate to have the option to live with my folks so I can save up. 

2010 - Switch job/company for a new salary of $63k.

2011 - Internal job change to $68k. 

2012  - Switch job/company to $80k.

2013 - Buy a 1 BR cooperative in in the downtown area. The building is old, and the coop fees are high, but I love the location and the neighborhood. $229k purchase price with 20% down @ 3.75% interest nets me a mortgage at roughly $850/mo. All cooperative fees + additional costs add roughly the same, for a total monthly payment of $1700. 

2014 - Internal job switch. Base salary stays the same, but I get ~$20k in commission, bringing my total to ~$110k. Get married. Luckily decide to keep our finances completely separate, which was a great idea, because...

2015 - Get divorced. I decide to take a sabbatical in Q4; what was intended as 1 year off balloons into 2 years. I spend a year camping through Africa, 6 months in the Indian subcontinent, and 6 months thru-hiking the Appalachian trail. These were the best 2 years of my life. Total cost abroad for the 2 years was around 40k. When I return, I find that my NW is about the same as when I left. 

2018 - Find a new job with a salary of $132k. My two year sabbatical, surprisingly, does not seem to be an issue at all.

2019 - Find a new job with an F500 company. Lower base salary, but new company allows me to do mega backdoor roth, and there are stock incentives. Total cash comp ~135k. Over the next ~18 months, my company 401k is over 100k.

2020 - Get fired; with COVID happening decide to join a family member for a ~3 month camping road trip out west. Think a lot about what I want my life to look like, and how I can build that life. 

### Where I'm at now
* Mortgage down to ~$156k. With appreciation, my place is now worth around ~375k. (Have not refinanced, still at 3.75%. Coop fee is now almost exactly $1k/month, but this is my ""all in"" cost - includes all utilities, taxes, insurance, etc.)
* 205k in Betterment @ 100% stocks in default allocation
* 200k in an IRA @ 100% stocks
* 140k in a Roth IRA @ 100% stocks (I took serious advantage of the megabackdoor roth with my two years available)
* 13k in a solo 401k
* 6k in an HSA (invested)
* ~20k sitting in cash (for now)

### My Living Expenses
I don't do a super good job tracking living expenses, but I live a fairly simple life. My main hobbies are weightlifting, bike riding, and reading. My total household costs are roughly:

* $1850/month housing
* $250/month food
* $30/month cell phone bill
* $30/month transportation (bike share + public transit; no car) 
* $45/month gym membership
* $300/month everything else (hangouts with friends, apartment stuff, clothes, etc.) 

At my current salary, I'm able to comfortably save between $5k-6k a month. 

### Back to the story...
While on the road with my brother (this is over the summer, Jul - Sep 2020), I find two candidate companies and take interviews from hotel rooms in between camping under the stars. I'm trying to figure out how to best balance my love for the outdoors with ""professional"" jobs that allow a couple weeks off, at best. I know I don't want to go back to working full time, but I don't really know how to go about navigating the situation.

I take one final round interview, which goes really well. This is how the conversation goes:

> Boss: OK, cool, the interview is over. That went well. We want to hire you.
> 
> Me: ...Huh, what? You've decided already?
> 
> Boss: Yeah, let's talk about what that looks like, if you want to work here.
> 
> Me: ....Uh...yeah, sure. I mean, the company sounds awesome, but I'm not sure it would work out...
> 
> Boss: Oh, why not?
> 
> Me: Well....I don't think I want to work 12 months a year.
> 
> Boss: OK. Not everyone here works full time. What do you mean, you don't want to work 12 months a year? How often do you want to work?
> 
> Me: Uhh....I'm not sure? Maybe 6 months on, 6 months off? (I could feel my sphincter tighten up as I asked for this. I was totally unprepared for this conversation!)
> 
> Boss: ......We can accommodate that. Any other big issues?

I was shocked how easy it was! There was almost no push back, and no negotiations on my desire to work only 6 months a year. Luckily, I work as a consultant where projects are typically 6-9 months long, so this ask isn't as crazy as it sounds. We spent some time negotiating what the offer looked like, considering the unusual circumstances, and we settled at $75/hr 1099. 

### What the Future Looks Like
I'm super excited to have the flexibility to travel six months a year, and I know intellectually I shouldn't need to save any additional money to retire at ~60. I'm also extremely fortunate to work in a field where I love going into work every day. I plan on doing a lot more ""long hikes"" - the Pacific Crest Trail, the Te Aroroa, some hikes in Europe - as well as more backpacking/camping trips. 

In terms of finances, I should bring in 12.5k a month * 6 months = $75k. I haven't run all the numbers, but as a 1099 I should be able to shelter a ton of money from the IRS:

* $19.5k 401k
* $~12k 401k (""company"" match)
* $3.5 k HSA + ~3.6k in health care costs (Bronze Plan as a Single person)
* $6k IRA
* $~12k (20% passthrough as a sole prop)

So self employment tax notwithstanding, my federal and state taxes should be quite low.

### The Elephant in the Room - My Apartment
Every time I run the numbers, paying nearly 2 grand a month for my apartment seems crazy, especially if I only plan in living in it 6 months a year. Unfortunately my HOA rules do *not* allow renters for terms under one year. 

Another option I've considered is selling my apartment, and using the proceeds to either pay all cash for a place in a lower COL (Las Vegas? Charlotte?) and never worry about a mortgage again, or possibly try the digital nomad life for a year or two. 

In the short term, I think I'm OK holding it. When I travel overseas, I usually travel quite cheaply - either camping or staying in hostels, eating street food, walking around a lot, things like that. Even if my annual expenses balloon a bit, I would feel very comfortable pulling ~10k/year (5%) from my Betterment account to cover the delta. The other option, of course, is to work 8 or 9 months a year for a couple years if I'm drawing down my Betterment account too fast. 

### Wrap Up
I've been super fortunate with my life, and I'm really excited to see how the next phase unfolds. Please let me know what you think!

### EDIT - FOLLOW-UP Q+A
*Q: You had help!*

A: Yes, I thought it was so blindingly obvious that I didn't get here alone that I wasn't super explicit about that. I thought the most interesting part about this post was my desire to go half time, and how that unfolded, but I see in retrospect adding in numbers makes everyone wants to run their own calculation.

*Q: What help did you get?*

A: **My grandmother died in early 2019 and left me ~$70k.** This *absolutely* impacted my decision and probably moved my decision up 12-15 months. College was paid for. Leveraging family connections to get my first internship. I also kept about ~10k in cash wedding gifts even after the divorce, but that was mainly out of spite, so let's not dwell on it :)

*Q: The numbers still don't make sense!*

A: Technically that's not a question, but yes, they do. I'm not sure where some of the commenters were getting an ""estimated NW of 300k running the numbers"", but here's a more granular breakdown. These are estimates, I don't have everything tracked super well. 

Years | Yearly Cash Savings | Total Cash Savings | S&P Index Then | Equivalent $ Now | How?
---|---|----|----|----|----
2004 - 2007 | $4k | $16k | ~1300 | ~40k | Interns were eligible for 401 (+match). I took advantage of this, heavily. I also worked during winter break, so it was more than just 3 months/year.
2009 - 2012 | $25k | $100k  | ~1300 | ~250k  | I was living at home, with my folks. Expenses were close to zero. My savings rate some years was probably over 80%. $25k/year is lower than I saved, I excluded the ~12.5k/year * 4 years that went towards my down payment.
2013 - 2015 | $40k | $120k | ~2000 | ~200k | By 2014 I cross into 6 figures, these savings rates are not that impressive
2018 - 2019 | $60k | $120k | ~2800 | ~140k | Megabackdoor Roth, primarily.

Total ""stock equivalent"" savings = 40k + 250k + 200k + 140k + 70k (from grandma) = $700k in stocks. My actual holdings are less. The lion's share of this delta is when I pulled out $40k between 2015 - 2017 to fund my sabbatical, which has a total ""cost"", with gains, of closer to $65. (I also pulled out smaller amounts throughout the years for other trips.) 

*Q: There's an error in your math!*

A: Yeah, probably. It's not intentional.

*Q: It's impossible to buy a house for $230k in a HCOL!""*

A: I agree that it's probably impossible to buy an apartment in 2020 in a HCOL for $230k. I bought in 2013, and I technically didn't buy an apartment, I bought a cooperative. These are similar, but coops are typically more depressed in value than apartments because of restrictions. I also bought in what was a lower income, more racially diverse area, so gentrification (and therefore house prices) hadn't quite caught up. But yeah, I got an absolute steal of a deal, if I do say so myself. 

*Q: So you took 2 years off, spent about $40k, and when you came back, your net worth was about the same? Please, explain the magic of compound interest!*

A: For sure, my dude! I *think* I had about $350k invested in the market about that time. I pulled out about $40k, leaving me $310k. My sabbatical was almost exactly 2 years, Nov 2015 - Nov 2017. In Nov 2015, the S&P index was at ~2020. When I came back in Nov 2017, the S&P was ~2600. That's about a 30% gain. (350 - 40) + 30% > 350. Go, compound interest! (This excludes the ~8k I gained in NW by renters paying down my mortgage for me.)

850,Another Chapter in my Story....,,903,f1m7o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f1m7o3/another_chapter_in_my_story/,1581315162.0,"So I have posted a few times here about some bumps in the road on my career trajectory and how my saving early on has worked in my favor.  I have a new chapter in my story.

NW:  $1.6M
Age:  43
Married with one child

Back story:  six months ago I received a glowing letter from my immediate supervisor on how well I was performing.  All the metrics the admin types look at, I was doing extremely well.  Had a good working relationship with my coworkers too.  Was extremely happy at the time.

Fast forward five weeks:  we have a facility closure in my region.  I am not being laid off but asked to relocate.  It felt like a gut punch and was without question a step down.  They told me they would keep me in my current role for another three months, despite being overstaffed, “as a courtesy”.  

In time I was given some schedules and assignments on my way out that seemed punitive and were unacceptable to me.  

How I would have handled this if I didn’t have decent savings:  Tuck my tail between my legs and keep working

How I handled it given my current situation:  I got confrontational.  I told them this was unacceptable.  I provided ample evidence my peers were not given such assignments/schedule in short time.  I demanded them to make some changes.  They refused.  I resigned abruptly and told them to find someone else to do their grunt work.

Three months later, I have started my own business and found flexible side work I can do from home as I grow the business.  New business has been a bit slow to take off admittedly but we are progressing and increasing our marketing strategies.  I wish I could be more specific but it would potentially reveal my identity.

My income is right now a fraction of what it was before, but growing week to week.  I did have a moment or two after I was in the early stages of my new career path where I briefly felt panic.  But mostly that has not been an issue.

What has gotten me through those occasional moments:  reminding myself that my entire career thus far, saving aggressively for a number of years, was in order to help me in a moment like this.  Coming to that realization, I was able to accept the short term drop in income.  I recognized that if I let stress eat me up during this time then my entire career saving for the future has accomplished nothing.

So today ironically I spend zero time stressing about money.  Month to month when my income was an order of magnitude higher I was far more meticulous about it all.  I have given myself permission to relax and focus on the next chapter.  And it feels great.

Today I work on my own terms.  My side gig is enough to support my family month to month and my new business if it takes off will be more lucrative.  I still have a lot to accomplish but today I believe in myself and I believe I will look back on my last job and the way things went south as a blessing.",financialindependence

I’m 29, im recently in a new job earning 130K (very stoked and proud of getting here) I’ve got 64k in the stock market (24 in roth, 40 in stocks), 60k in crypto’s and 70k in the bank.

I work hard. I freelance on top of my full time stuff, I freelance on top of freelance, i’m often rebalancing my portfolio and looking for any and all ways I can make some extra dough, like selling things on facebook market or doing quick design gigs for friends. 

I enjoy work, I enjoy setting goals and meeting them - and learning through the process of sending cold emails and outreach and working with teams and being responsible and challenging myself - it’s all part of what makes you better overall. But I also feel myself further from being able to ever really relax. I so badly want to be a millionaire in my early thirties and I know I can, and I know I’ll have to put in the work for it - but at the same time it’s like i’ve forgotten how to take a break sometimes.

The older over gotten i’ve also realized the importance in really putting time in strategy before executing, and I need to transition away from the go go go work work work mentality but it’s difficult. 

I have two friends who are younger and older than me who both made a million off the crypto come up, and id be there too if I simply
held the investment (although at that point in time a few years ago, I had essentially no savings and was not doing so hot financially and had to liquidate what I had for rent) and I sometimes find myself sulking in that fact. It’s unfair to play the woulda shoulda game, but knowing how hard i’ve worked for what I do have now - it’s aggravating thinking I could
have had even more than my current net worth by literally just letting time pass.

This post is really just me aiming to start a dialogue with people who might have had similar struggles of really just consuming themselves in work - for better or worse, and their findings and how to keep your mental health in check while you’re on the financial journey.

852,Hi Guys. I'm 51 and just retired. My girlfriend put me on her insurance. I have about,,900,bks3oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bks3oz/hi_guys_im_51_and_just_retired_my_girlfriend_put/,1557018450.0,"$950,000 in liquid assets and own my house and cars.  I live in the South.  I have a kidney issue that may be problematic in a few years.  My question is simple - I grew up poor.  My Dad died when I was 11 and it was tough growing up.  I put myself through college, grad school and law school through work.  After 21 years as a lawyer, I decided to enjoy my life and quit that BS.  I've been retired since January but a buddy hired me on making a crazy amount of money for however many hours I want ( I chose around 15).  I volunteer  for several organizations.

Here is my first problem.  I feel like a loser since everyone I know is working and I'm just doing whatever day to day.  Hiking, fishing and helping out around the neighborhood.  How can I get over this feeling of worthlessness?  It's not like I'm on disability like my neighbor who sits on his ass and gets his check and doesn't even want to contribute to society.  I contribute to society every day with my volunteering and work my 15 hours but still feel kinda worthless.

Second, I have never been able to spend money on myself.  I can buy things for other people but can't spend it on myself.  And I'm cheap as hell.  I rarely go to dinner unless I go to half price sushi night up the street.  How can I start spending my hard earned money on me instead of saving it for when I die and leave it to a relative?  I travel to Colorado four times a year but take the redeye flight and sleep under the stars instead of spending $100 a night in a hotel.

All comments are very appreciated.

I'm not opposed to posts where people mention their milestones or progress, in fact I generally like them. The problem is that someone inevitably asks what kind of work the person does and how they got into that line of work. Far too often the response is very cryptic and that bothers me a bit. While there are many people who have become financially independent and/or retired early while making a moderate income, it seems that most people who do it have pretty good incomes (combined with great saving habits, good decision making, in many cases supportive partners...). 

I think that one of the most helpful things we can do for each other is to talk about what we do for a living, how we got there, roughly how much we get paid and the region we live in. The truth is that a guy making 100k is far more likely to require early than a guy in the same city making the same decisions with a salary of 50k.

I understand the desire to keep things private, but there are very few industries that are so niche that a post on reddit will instantly out you or lead to you suddenly having tons of competition.

I propose that anyone willing post the following:

* ballpark salary
* region, state, tri-state area or whatever you're comfortable posting so people have an idea of your areas cost of living
* what you do for a living
* how you got the job, career, occupation...
* any advice you have for others on breaking in

I'd also ask that instead of saying ""I'm a software engineer"", please say something like ""I'm a software engineer and my company makes software for railroads"" or ""I'm a software engineer at a finance company""

Hopefully this will catch on because I think where to go career wise or when to move on because of better opportunities is one thing that hinders a lot of people's journey to financial independence (even if their definition of it has nothing to do with retiring early)",financialindependence

I had previously taken a more qualitative look at it ([HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ajp2y4/market_valuation_and_its_effects_on_the_safe)),  but I wanted to expand on the idea and actually see if it were possible to formulate a SWR forecast. Links to the paper are listed below. 

[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yO0K96Iyc09ihjk8f6j-yZizVGVJDCvw/view?usp=sharing)

[Excel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n8suK1EdGLvpuXJ_JtKRx9cF4rO0VrO/view?usp=sharing)

In the paper, I shared my methodology as well as proposed a variable withdrawal strategy based on this new valuation approach. 

I think it's worth the read (and it's not very long with lots of pictures), but I'll share some of the findings below. 



**Quick Intro**

I calculated the actual SWR for every year from 1928 to 1990. I compiled these SWR's along with the CAPE (Shiller PE) and 10 year treasury yield for each starting period, and performed a linear regression analysis on the data. The resulting equation showed good correlation (R^2 = 0.72). Refer to the paper for more details on the methodology. 

All data in the study is for a 70/30 portfolio.



**Findings**

The 95% confidence formula for SWR based on this valuation approach is as follows:

SWR_predicted = 0.55597 × (Implied Yield) + 0.11051 × (Spread) + 0.0082319

where, 

Implied Yield = 0.7 × (1/CAPE) + 0.3 × (Treasury Yield)

Spread = 1/CAPE - (Treasury Yield)



**Variable Withdrawal Method**

In the paper, I looked at one way to implement this valuation approach and compared it to the trinity study. The basis was simply withdraw the amount based on the predicted SWR and portfolio value at the start of each year. I set a withdrawal floor at the minimum of 40k or the 1st years withdrawal amount. Setting a floor is important from a practical sense as any methodology that could leave you withdrawing at the poverty level isn't very useful. 

Performing a back test, this method never failed in any 30 year period, and also reduces the likelihood of massive portfolio expansion like trinity study has in the past (1980's for example). Withdrawals taken from year to year are also relatively smooth with the variable approach. 

In the paper, I shared portfolio performance and withdrawal summaries for some interesting years: 1929, 1966, 1982, 2000.



**Current State of Affairs**

To kick off 2021, the current projected SWR is projected to be between 2.35% - 4.81% (likely a little higher after this morning). The lower bound of 2.35% ties the year 2000 as the lowest predicted SWR of all years in this study.

856,My Fire journey accelerated via the Middle East. Middle East life overview and saving potential.,,893,cdc3yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cdc3yx/my_fire_journey_accelerated_via_the_middle_east/,1563159920.0,"This is really long, but I wanted to be as complete as possible for those truly interested in the information.  I had to do comment replies to this original post to complete my post because of so many words.  It took me a couple of days to write this up.

&#x200B;

I have been living in Kuwait for the past 2 years and 9 months.  I took a US government contractor job and am doing computer support on a US base in Kuwait.

&#x200B;

What got me here?

I was making right at 6 figures in Florida doing the same job I am doing now in Kuwait.  I was not getting the FIRE savings acceleration I wanted and being a government contractor I always wanted a slice of that sweet overseas money.  I had a house and a girlfriend, but nothing really holding me back from taking a planned 1 year relocation to Kuwait.  The money is over double here compared to what I was making in Florida, plus there are many perks.

I also knew a few guys that had spent time in the Middle East and could answer all of my questions about life, safety and other general questions I had about Kuwait and Middle East life before making the plunge.  I hope to cover some of this for you here.

&#x200B;

Let me clarify what I mean by the Middle East.  I am speaking of safer locations and not direct war zones.  I am specifically speaking of Kuwait, Dubai and Qatar.  I am not speaking of nor am I recommending accelerating FIRE in a war zone.  While lots of people live and work in these places as US gov't contractors and make legit money, these places carry too much risk to your physical and mental health.  You can't benefit from FIRE if you get dead or emotionally scarred trying to solve for it.  We are discussing a solution that carries at least a somewhat normal life with more limited amount of risk. I will explain further later.

&#x200B;

So before we get into what it is like, let's talk money.  I am currently debit free minus a mortgage payment back home and am saving at a +-70% rate comfortably and have $200k saved so far.  My savings goal is near completion: $300k not including retirement savings.  I'm maxing out IRA and 401k and using Mint to help me track account balances as well as using it's Goals feature to track my savings goal that is made up of a few different accounts.

I got a bit of a slow start saving over here as I paid off a good bit off debt upon first arriving and had initial living expenses in Kuwait to be covered like deposits, TV, bed couch, washing machine, etc.

I plan to leanFIRE via the 300k saved mostly in VTSAX + 100k profit from selling my house that will also go to VTSAX or some other similar fund and live on a few acres of land in Florida that is already paid for.  The key for me to leanFIRE is to have zero rent or mortgage payment.  I will improve the land and live in a large shed already on the land allowing me to slowly self build a reasonable house without taking on any home debit.  Power, water, and septic tank already exist on the property as well as a very basic and small standalone bathroom structure.  I'll build as funds are available via 4 to 5% initial withdraw rate in addition to a part time job at Lowes or some other workplace that offers part time employee healthcare.  I also plan to stay physically active and may start a small lawn mowing side hustle using basic lawn care tools which I already own.  My days of sitting behind a keyboard for hours on end are hopefully behind me.

I plan to keep 1 year's worth of expenses in a high yield savings account to avoid withdrawing investment funds during a dip or a short term market downturn. I acknowledge that my total saved is lower than a normal FIRE and my withdrawal rate is higher.  Everything is fluid and adjustable.  We will see how it goes.  I also plan to spend a minimum of 1 month per year in another country staying in an affordable Airbnb type apartment and living like a local.

&#x200B;

Ok back to living in the Middle East and why I think it is something worth considering for those that are hankering for a bit of adventure or want to accelerate their FIRE plans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What are the perks?

\#1. Excellent pay.  The caveat for me is that I work more hours.  I work 12 hour shifts 5 days per week.  This sucks at first, but you get used to it.

\#2. The tax benefit.  Overseas workers spending the majority of the year overseas are exempt from paying income taxes on the first $103,900 of their income.  However the tax rate is based on the full earned amount.  For example if you are making 140k overseas and don't pay taxes on the first 103,900, you will pay taxes on the remaining $36,100 at the 140k tax rate.  This tax exempt amount changes yearly, but this is a really nice perk.  Subtract any tax deductions from that 36k as well by the way.  You can also deduct overseas cost of living as well. (I think my overseas cost of living deduction is around $30k but look up Foreign Housing Exclusion for more info.  Don't count on your tax guy to know about this unless he deals with overseas workers a bunch.)  With that and tax deductible retirement contributions, you could easily avoid paying any taxes even if making well over 100k per year overseas.  I am paid in dollars direct deposit into a US checking account.  I am not paid in the Kuwaiti currency called the Kuwaiti Dinar (usually called KD).

\#3. Easy access to awesome travel.  This wasn't something I really considered until I got here and talked to coworkers that had been to some amazing places, sometimes even on a quick holiday weekend.  This side of the world has lots to offer that is typically an expensive or miserably long flight from America, so rarely travelled by westerners.  Places like Dubai, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, Bali, Africa, etc are all really accessible from the Middle East.

\#4. Safety.  Put simply, it is safe in Kuwait.  I can also speak for Dubai and Qatar.  As Westerners we think the Middle East is a collection of AK's and militants, but I can tell you that could not be further from the truth in the countries I am speaking of.  The people here are different from us, but also strive to be like us.  Additionally, these countries are quite rich and money makes for less desperation, better policing and no desire to mess up a good thing.  These countries also welcome tons of migrant workers.  Tons!  These migrant workers in Kuwait outnumber the Kuwaitis by a factor of three.  They practically run the country's day to day ops.  From customer interfacing at shops in a mall to managing the oil fields, to being a doctor or dentist.  It is good to be a Kuwaiti.  They are not taxed at all and are provided with pay scales from the government based on their family's bloodline.  They all get paid, but some more than others.  Same for the other countries mentioned.  As for the migrants, well having migrant workers works really great here.  They are checked (as was I) for criminal background and diseases and then allowed in to work.  They generally work very hard at jobs the Kuwaitis do not want.  Earning double or triple what they could earn back home and send the money back home to support their families.  They don't interest themselves in crime.  Nobody I know here has ever been the victim of any crime in any way in Kuwait.  Zero.  None.  You can pull up stats somewhere online that will tell you than no American has been killed in Kuwait since 2001.  I read that before coming, and this put my mind at ease.  I could not say the same thing about my very small home town in the US.  Not even for 1 month let alone nearly 20 years.  That's not to say there is no crime here ever.  The typical crime here is someone at home abusing their live-in maid.  These ladies are often abused, controlled, sometimes murdered and paid very little.  There is a problem here that Kuwait is addressing and abuses are not going unpunished with recent executions of those responsible for murdering a maid.

Let's quickly address Iran.  This is a bit of a concern with the escalation recently between them and us.   We aren't necessarily in the line of fire, but it would be foolish to discount them as a threat to life of any American in a nearby country.  Their coast is less than 50 miles from our coast.  Kuwait does a really great job of staying out of Middle East problems though and tries to keep the peace among Arab nations.  I don't know what the future holds.  I can tell you I was more concerned about my safety a couple of years ago though....  When Trump briefly banned Muslims access into America, I could feel the stares when out in public.  I was honestly a bit concerned that there would be some retaliation against me personally.  That did not happen though and I have never felt that way again.  I do get a few stares just because I am a white guy.  The Kuwaitis that I have spoken to are always warm and friendly to me when they find out I am American and always mention their independence from Iraq and our assistance in that endeavour.  I take no credit for this, but thank them and explain that I was in school at the time.  They have a HUGE party every year and it makes me feel proud that our country among others helped free Kuwait from Sadam and that they still celebrate this freedom every year.

\#5. Free housing.  I am provided company housing or a stipend go find housing of my own.  There are no utilities cost in Kuwait.  Water, trash, sewer and electric are free for everyone here.

&#x200B;

Ok that sums up the major perks.  Let me tell you more about life here.

&#x200B;

What is the weather like?

It is HOT! Like cook food on your car's dashboard hot!  One of my coworkers does occasionally cook cookies for us on her dash.  Because of the heat, there are laws about working outside limited to morning and evenings.  It is not always adhered to, but it exists.  Also because of the heat most people don't go outside unless they have to during the day in summer.  This causes nightly sundown rush hour on the roads.  In winter, it can get a bit chilly and is generally windy here year round so it feels pretty darn cold.  It typically rains a few times per year and can flood due to the sandy ground not being too absorbing of water and clogged storm drains that have filled with sand and debris throughout the year.  There are dust storms several times per year and they are miserable.  No real bugs to speak of.  Some roaches inside, but few flies and I've never seen a mosquito here.  Lots of street cats.  Some street dogs, but these are rare because dogs are just less resourceful than cats and can't jump into dumpsters to find food scraps.  I occasionally see herds of sheep and camels.  They are not wild, they are managed by a person herding.  Typically the person is sitting in a 4x4 truck used as a herding vehicle.  Camels are always cool to see.  They are just so funny looking.  The locals eat the young camels from what I understand.  I have never tried the meat.  I think the ones I see often are used for camel racing, as I often see them with ropes or saddles.  They race them using tiny robot jockeys with remotely operated cordless drills outfitted with whip attachments.

&#x200B;

Cleanliness - Kuwait is not as nice as Qatar and Dubai as far as infrastructure and cleanliness.  There are some nice areas here, but the majority are not so nice with lots of trash and mess around and just general clutter.  This is not always the fault of the locals though.  There are lots of bad habits brought in by workers from outside of the country.  Some have disregard for cleanliness and also disregard for any traffic laws or parking sanity.  The roads are not maintained well and highways are not to American standards so highway exits come up fast and merge lanes are short.  Google Maps works great here and is a damn life saver for getting around as well as routing around traffic jams.

&#x200B;

Food - This is a big part of travelling and being in another country in general.  The food here is highly Americanized.  They love American food especially burgers and most all of the big chain American restaurants are here and very busy.  There are also traditional restaurants of course and I have partaken in some amazing Iranian food consisting of grilled chicken, yellow rice, some potato soup and flat bread cooked in an oven where the baker takes a wad of dough and throws it against the hot stone oven wall for cooking.  Pretty awesome and tasty.  They also love their date fruit over here.  It is one of the few food items Kuwait produces.  I understand now how sanctions impact a country that can't or doesn't produce for themselves.  If Kuwait was sanctioned for food imports, we would all starve within a matter of weeks.  Literally nothing is produced or made in Kuwait.

As for groceries, we have you covered and the selection is different, but quite good.  Some of the nicest (and some of the most disgusting) grocery stores I have ever visited have been in Kuwait. It is pretty much all here.  Some product names you know and most you don't.  If you recognize it, it was imported from the US and has a sticker reflecting this and a jacked up price as well.  Want Ragu spaghetti sauce?  No problem.  That will be triple the price of what you'd pay back home.  Excellent selection of fruits and veggies and the country of origin is always listed next to the price and can be quite interesting.  Who knew they grew Mango fruit in Egypt....?  Rice?  Ya we got ya covered there.  I have never seen so much rice selection.  There is a whole wall dedicated to rice varieties.

Typically I like to cook an Instapot full of some chili, soup or some other concoction that can go over rice and eat that for the week at work to save some bucks and get some decent nutrition.

&#x200B;

Gotta have a car - Driving can be a challenge.  There are lots and lots of traffic jams, most of which follow no rhyme or reason and happen at hours you would not expect.  The Kuwaitis normally have pretty nice cars and drive very fast and aggressively.  Lots of trucks and SUVs here and interestingly, a ton of old Mercury Gran Marquis here.  Like a lot lot of them.  I guess they are just built like a tank and ride good on the crummy roads here.  Also, there is little regard for fuel mileage, so they fit in that way too.  I have seen zero hybrid cars here.  (lots in Dubai though) I've heard there was a Tesla around, but never seen it personally.  No official Tesla sales possible here to my knowledge, so I think that car was shipped in.  Also any repair for a Tesla would have to be done in Dubai or fly a Tesla guy in special to do it.  Nothing is impossible when you have money.

When I first got here, it was nothing to see a car on the side of the highway that had been flipped, burned and generally looked like it was the worst wreck imaginable.  They seem to have gotten lots more speed cameras over the years now though and this has slowed down the locals tremendously.  Now it is rare to see a severely wiped out car on the side of the highway.  As much as I hate speed cameras, they really do work in a country like this one.  My work provides me a car to use free of charge including free gas.  Gas prices are .085 KD per litre subsidized by the government.  (About $1 per gallon) Every gas station has the same gas price and they are full service.  You do not get out in the heat and pump your own gas here.

&#x200B;

Communication - Living day to day speaking only English is really easy here.  Of course the native language is Arabic however all of the street signs are in Arabic and English and everywhere you interface with a business they all speak English.  In some cases even the Kuwaitis must speak English in their own country in order to buy goods and services.

&#x200B;

Mosques and religion - There are lots of Mosques here.  I heard somewhere that there should be a Mosque every 500 meters by law.  I don't believe that, but they are a part of every day life.  They are no issue with the exception of their loud speakers.  You don't want to live next door to a Mosque unless you are Muslim.  In some cases, you can live within earshot of two if you aren't careful.  They have several bullhorn type loudspeakers mounted on the building and they call to prayer at all hours of the day and night depending on what the moon is doing and what they may be celebrating.  Friday is their day of worship and the speaker will go for an hour straight at noon on Friday -in addition to the other prayer calls.  You get used to it, but it is something to be aware of.  They do have Christian churches here too and I have some hardcore Christian co-workers that feel they can do their thing without fear here.  I don't know if there are any Buddhist temples or other religions openly practised here but I would assume that there are no issues with any of them.

Ramadan - This is the big one in the Middle East.  This is a month long religious devotion check or test of their faith.  I don't know everything about it, but it follows the moon again and basically they do not eat or drink during the day during the month of Ramadan.  Once the sun goes down, they eat and drink.  Out of respect for their discomfort, non Muslims should not eat or drink outside during the day also.  Eat and drink inside your home or apartment all you want.  Restaurants and shopping malls have adjusted hours stay closed for the day and stay open later in the night because the people stay up all night to sleep away their fasting.  Well there has to be a bit of logic here still and there are exceptions given for those doing outside work that need water, sick people, babies and pregnant moms.  They are also supposed to abstain from sex during Ramadan.  How does this affect a non-Muslim working here?  We do not drink outside, do not eat outside and this includes in your car or even chewing gum.  Don't do it.  You can get arrested under some circumstances especially in ultra conservative countries like Saudi.  I have heard Saudi actually has special Ramadan police forces ensuring compliance.  -But we are not discussing Saudi here.

Dubai within the last couple of years has relaxed their Ramadan policy.  They now allow restaurants to be open any hours they want and serve food any time of the day, but serve the customers behind sheets or other media used for closing off the view from passers-by.  They had to do this to help avoid shutting down their whole tourism industry during the month of Ramadan.  Money trumps all in the end.

> Whenever you decide to not do something, instead of saying, ""I don't have time to..."" say, ""I am not making it a priority to...""  

So something like ""I don't have time to cook dinner"" becomes ""I am not making it a priority to cook dinner.""  

The main purpose of this serves to show you what you value in terms of importance in your life, but I also find it is a helpful reminder that you are in control of your life. If you woke up and wanted to go to the Grand Canyon tomorrow, you could do so. There are a lot of priorities/excuses you could use to not do it (I have kids, I have to go to work, etc) but none of those can actually stop you from waking up and making your way towards the Grand Canyon. Maybe you have enough money and you can fly, maybe you can only drive, maybe you have to walk or hitchhike. Obviously there are some restrictions like being in prison or not having a passport or whatever, but you get the idea. You have the power to control your life. You choose to go to your job, you choose to eat what you eat, you choose to save your money. I believe a majority of the people in /r/fi grasp this concept as the whole purpose of financial independence is taking control of our finances to push up retirement/freedom by multiple years or even decades. That being said, lately I have noticed a lot of animosity towards the success of others backed up by poor excuses that I usually only see from /r/pf members or in the yahoo finance comment sections.  

* *He only is successful because his parents let him live at home for 2 years until he found a job*  

* *If I could have had scholarships and a part-time job I could have done that too*  

* *Not everyone can just magically start a side-hustle making 100K/yr*  

* *Where does the 50K he starts with come from? I'm betting his parents gave it to him. Another typical spoon-fed 2X year old who doesn't understand real life*  

The list goes on and frankly it's a little disappointing to see in this sub because I think we're better than that. The entire point of /r/fi is recognizing that we CAN make a difference in our lives. We study IRAs, 401Ks, backdoor loopholes, tax advantaged accounts, investment strategies, etc so that we can beat the system. We work harder than our coworkers studying these things and I bet if any of them came to you and called you lucky to have money saved you would be offended because you simply took advantage of your situation and you made sacrifices along the way that they never will know about. You built your own path to financial success while they spent all their money on a new Audi S8 and a huge house they can barely afford.  

At the age of 12 years old I found a business game online where the winners at the end of each week could win cash prizes. I had always loved the idea of making money so I sat down and studied the game and worked harder than anyone else in the game and after a couple of years I made a couple of grand that I used to buy myself an XBOX 360 and some other fun toys.  

When I was 15 I was playing a Facebook game called ""Warbook"" and was able to work my way into the top 100 players or so where my kingdom was making exponentially more gold than a majority of players. I recognized the opportunity and sent an email off the the game maker to see if he would allow me to sell gold. He didn't care and I made over 2 grand in 2 weeks before everyone else in the game caught on and flooded the market to where I just didn't care to proceed.  

As a junior in high school I Googled ""Top 10 paying jobs"" and chose to study Computer science out of that.  

After college I was working my IT job and decided I wanted to earn more so I looked into potential side hustle opportunities. I researched/attempted flipping items on Ebay, re-selling wholesale/repackaged items on Amazon, building mobile apps, website creation jobs, etc. Eventually after failing to get multiple side hustles off the ground (a lot of times due to lack of interest after much research or effort), I found something I liked in streaming video games on Twitch. I found enjoyment and saw potential and so I sat down and began working hard on building an environment/layout/stream that viewers would enjoy. It took a little bit to really get off the ground but I've been able to find success and it's a profitable side-hustle for me now.  

As some of you may know from my [Build the life you want, then save for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/58j8pc/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=financialindependence) post, I made many sacrifices along the way to make my Twitch stream successful and those drove me to learn about creating a successful life outside of financial success too.

Regardless, now that I have found some Twitch success do you know what I hear every day from other people trying to make streaming work?

* *You just got lucky to get into streaming 2 years ago. Nobody unknown can make it big anymore*  

* *I just don't have time to stream like you do*  

* *You probably just knew some big streamers and got their viewers to come to your channel. I wish I had connections*  

The list goes on. And yet every day I see new streamers starting up who work hard and grow their streams into something bigger. Just like every day I look around this sub and see people posting who have taken control of their lives and the opportunities they were presented and made the most of them. Some of them were able to figure it out easier than others, some of them started with a boost, some of them failed less than others, but none of them quit because they saw someone else succeed. None of them said, ""He was just lucky, I could never be that successful."" Instead of comparing paths they looked at their own situation and figured out what they could do.  

It's like looking at Madonna and being upset that she is successful because she has an amazing voice. ""Well if I was born with that voice I'd be successful. She doesn't even know how lucky she got."" Her path to success is not the only path and it's not your path either. Do you think Bill Gates would have never amounted to anything if his parents didn't send him to private school? Do you think Elon Musk would ever settle for a 9-5 job at an accounting firm?  I like to think not. I imagine they are people who were going to find a path to success no matter what situation they were put in. They didn't let any excuses get in the way and they made their own priorities. Just like the members of /r/fi don't accept the notion that you have to work until you're 65 or can only save 5-10% of your income max.  

Maybe you can't start a consulting gig making 100K/yr. Maybe your parents didn't let you live with them while you were looking for a job. Maybe you don't have the voice of an angel. So what? Try streaming on Twitch. Try reselling items from Goodwill. Try something brand new! Gary Dahl sold pet rocks to become a millionaire in a year. Rather than finding jealousy from this, find motivation. Let's celebrate those around us and create a positive environment where we can support our goals and realities. Life isn't always fair and we don't all start at the same place, but if you are sitting somewhere reading this right now you probably have started ahead of a lot of people in this world and should be grateful for that. Don't throw that away because you're too busy making excuses or worrying about your neighbors. You control your life, you choose your actions every day, and you build your own path to success.",financialindependence

867,"FIREd. My needs/wants are met at 2% withdrawal, but here’s why I’m taking 3.5%",,880,br6cgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/br6cgz/fired_my_needswants_are_met_at_2_withdrawal_but/,1558415518.0,"First the numbers, I’m 31 with X million invested. I’m taking XX,XXX/year (X,XXX/ month) in withdrawals which is approximately a 3.3-3.5% (including taxes paid) withdrawal rate. I live comfortably on X,XXX/month and put the extra X,XXX/month in a high-yield savings account.

First, my assumptions:

1.	My diversified portfolio of low cost index funds can be drawn down in perpetuity at 3.5%. Go Curry Cracker has a great post about perpetual withdrawal rates. 80/20 equites/bonds and moving to 90/10 this year.

2.	With this plan I will already die with way more money than I need.

Now, on why I’m doing it:

Some might leave this extra money invested so they can have a higher balance in 10 years and thus a higher withdrawal and bigger retirement later. But right now, my needs are well covered and then some. I can’t imagine what increasing my monthly budget more right now would do for me. BUT, I can imagine, after one year of saving XX,XXX lump sum, that I may want to: start a business, shoot a short film, donate to charity, buy bitcoin etc etc. There are so many fun/interesting things I could do with a lump sum NOW why on earth would I keep it invested so it increases my eventual withdrawals spread out over the rest of my years. 

There are so many I see aiming for such conservative withdrawal rates of 2-3% that I think it’s such a waste of resources you could use now to improve your life or others rather than stacking extra $$ on the back end of your life.

Note, this is the exact logic everyone who is not focused on retirement uses “you can’t spend it when you’re dead, so let’s spend it now.” The biggest difference is you’re already FI, so don’t need to save for retirement anymore. Saving for retirement is essentially what those who are ALREADY FI at 2% are doing.

TLDR: Even at 2% I’m FI. Research tells me 3.5%   WR will last forever, so I’m saving the 1.5%  extra to make cool projects, start risky businesses, help mom etc. My plan is to use this capital yearly as a lump sum to help avoid a “FIRE & Bored post”

EDIT: I have realized and concede that this is not the most OPTIMIZED approach to be the richest man in the ground. But it does help me mentally allocate money yearly and make sure I use it to donate, make art, or just enjoy hedonistically, even though it’s (marginally) suboptimal over leaving the money in the market til I’m ready to spend.

She didn't have the money and when I asked my four siblings to pitch in to help her, they all said they couldn't, so I bought my mom a place to live in.  I make less than most of my siblings, but I've always been a saver, and I was happy to be able to help.  She lived there about five years, and she died two months ago.  When she died, her small estate was divided up five ways among us siblings, and I realized that by saving my mom rent money for five years, I was actually writing my brothers and sisters a check.  This situation was completely my fault.  I was happy to help my mother, but I should have had more forethought about how that  all went down.

But what happened with my mother got me thinking about what will happen with the money I leave to my own kids.

I'm on the Trinity Study 4% bandwagon with my FI plan, with the intention of leaving a chunk of money to my three kids when I die.   I am divorced, and my ex has a base salary that's the same as mine, but saves nothing for retirement and like my brothers and sisters, never has any money at the end of the month because of a house twice as large as mine, new car, etc.  Like my brothers and sisters, my ex has never been a saver.

If I die before my ex and leave this chunk of money to my kids, I think they are likely to use it to help my ex with retirement.

Just as it seemed unfair for my siblings to get an equal share of my mother's modest estate when they weren't financially responsible enough to be in a position to help her, it seems unfair that the money I have saved may end up helping my spend thrift ex. I am not sure what advice you on this forum can give me, but I wanted to make the observation that if you scrimp and save and leave a chunk of money behind, it may very well go to someone much less frugal than you are who may blow on all the stupid shit you resisted buying along the way.

And that kinda sucks.  


  
EDIT:  
Lots of great advice on this post. Thanks!  
Many people suggested a trust or stipulated will to make sure my ex doesn't get anything, but that seems petty to me.  


Many other people suggested that I wanted to help my own mom, and I raised my kids to want to help their own parents which is a good thing.    


My ex is being irresponsible by spending too much not saving any money, and my children will bear the burden of it when they have to take care of her.    


Without any money from me, helping my ex would be a much greater burden on them, so leaving them money makes good sense, even if they use it to help my ex.",financialindependence

Growing up my grandparents and my father ""did the right thing"" with money, but they never really involved me in it except taking me to the bank and letting me write the deposit slip.

(inb4 ""could have asked"" - messy divorce when I was 13, grandparents died when I was 16, mom drained all the investment accounts for drugs, haven't seen dad since I was 17)

So for my niece, I want to teach her in a different way. She's 12 right now. Here's my plan:

&#x200B;

TLDR;

year 1 - $10 gift to start, in a box, i'll pay 10% interest on whatever money she has in that box at the end of every month.

year 2  - 100% match as the gift, plus 10% interest on whatever money she has in the box at the end of every month. I will require her to keep a written record of her balances and my interest payments

year 3 - 100% match as a gift, instead of 10% interest, she picks a security and I will pay her at the end of the month whatever that stock has done for the month

year 4 - 50% match as a gift, same deal with the stock

year 5 - I set her up with a roth IRA and her 50% match will be used for the opening deposit assuming she's had enough of an income by now (age 17)

I'm going to send her $9.99 for Christmas. Along with a treasure chest style box to keep it in. And an agreement that every month, I will pay her 10% interest on the balance she has in that chest. I picked $9.99 instead of $10 because this way I can give her a five, some ones and a bunch of change because kids. I figure the more pieces she sees the more value it looks like.

There is no restrictions on what she can do with the money. She is free to take it all out and spend it immediately if that's what she wants to do. 

Then each year for Christmas, instead of the 10% interest, I will match 100% of what she has. 

For the first year, I will be mailing her the money in an envelope. In the envelope I will include a very basic statement, showing her balance for all the months and the interest I paid. Starting in year 2, I will send her a blank statement sheet for the year, and in order to get the interest, she will have to count the money, write down her balance, and submit it to me. 

When she turns 15 I will stop paying 10% by default, and instead let her choose 1 stock or ETF. I will pay her based on the performance of that stock. I'll still send her the same statement, but now will add a graph showing the performance of her stock, and the performance of VTSAX for comparison. I'll let her change her stock pick once a month if she wants. If the stock runs negative she will get $0.99 in pennies, don't want her to get discouraged. Or I might just pay her a basic interest rate at whatever the current rates are in addition to the stock percentage. But who knows, they might be negative by then

The following year I'll cut the match from 100% down to 50% (she'll probably begin working and I don't wanna get suckered in to paying her $10k) but keep the same deal with the stock choices, but she can now choose more than 1 and she will be paid the average. Same as with the statements, in year 2 she will need to send me a report of the stock(s) performance in order to get the payment from me

I'm projecting this to cost between $3,000 and $7,000, depending on how much money she saves when she begins working. $3000 is about what the payout would be if she never took money out and never added her own money in and got a nice 3% return per month, every month on her stock picks. And really, the couple dollars a month I'm paying in interest should pretty much be covered by the interest off my emergency fund. That's how I came up with this idea actually, wondering what to do with the couple bucks a month in interest that would be worthwhile.",financialindependence

Started a software company at 17 (was in high school). First few years were good (100-250k pre-tax per year). Business really took off over the last 4 years. My last few years were all over $500k pre-tax. It's not all unicorns and roses. I'm the sole earner in the house right now. One of my parents has a disability and sibling too. Just managing all their medical needs takes up lots of time for my other parent (constant appointments, picking up prescriptions etc.). The household gets a net income of 120k per year and the rest stays in the corporation. Out of this 120k, half goes directly to paying off the mortgage, and our family lives off the other 60k (decently high COL area).

The business is finally at a point where I can comfortably provide for my family and build up assets at the same time, and it's great. I still get worried every now and then because business income isn't fixed and can go up and down every month, but hitting this milestone gives me so much more peace of mind that it'll be alright.

Here's the breakdown of money:

* 720k in investments
* 80k emergency fund
* 46k in new car fund (I've always loved cars and would definitely consider myself an enthusiast)
* 154k in day to day expense accounts

My goal for 2016 was to invest at least 300k, and so far I'm on track to actually reach 400k invested this year. 

I'm so happy I found this place. I've been lurking around for a couple years and it's really helped me nail down a proper plan going forward. This is my go to place when I have breakfast, and it's great :) Thanks for being an awesome community!

872,Sitting on $2 million and don't know what to do with it. I want to simplify everything.,,872,ad2ytc,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ad2ytc/sitting_on_2_million_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,1546754373.0,"Long story short some life events happened where today I am sitting on $2 million and I became financially independent overnight. I am in my mid-30s. Half of it is in cash and the other half is ""invested"": Betterment, Wealthfront, a Vanguard money market account, and some t-bills. No debt... house and two cars are fully paid for.

&#x200B;

I've lurked long enough to know most people will tell me to put it in to VTSAX and forget about it, but I am not sure that's enough. Most of what I have read here is for people on the journey towards FIRE. I'm already there (very quickly) with a bunch of cash and investments all over the place. The market has been rocky the last few months and each time it's gone down I invested some of my cash to catch some discounts. Most recently was a few weeks ago when stocks fell 5%.

&#x200B;

I feel like I should get out of robo-advisers entirely and throw all the money into Vanguard funds. I was thinking of this portfolio:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|VTSAX|60%|
|:-|:-|
|VWELX|10%|
|VBLTX|15%|
|VUSTX|15%|

&#x200B;

Simulations on [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com) seem to look good on this... but shouldn't I hold some international? What I like about this is it grows with the S&P500 but isn't as volatile. I could dump VWELX and buy more VTSAX, too.

&#x200B;

Also, what about market timing? I know that lump-sum is statistically a better option than trying to time the market, but we've been in a bull run for quite some time. I think recent volatility shows that some investors are skittish and are pulling out for fear and each time they do I can buy at a discount. Maybe I can DCA a fixed amount each month and throw more in each time the market falls. Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Lastly, the FIRE part... what's a good strategy on living off this money? 3% rule puts me at $60K. If I pull this out Vanguard funds won't I owe taxes? About how much is estimated? I can't really find a clear answer but it's be nice to know if I can spend the full $60K or if I have to send $10K to Uncle Sam.

And rightly so.  Wouldn't it be incredible to never have to work again?  Work sucks, right?

I just wanted to offer my perspective.

I'm from a FAIRLY wealthy family, and by that, I mean wealthy enough to support me at a low-level income without my really working.  I have never been afraid to quit a job, because my family is always there to catch me.  I don't pay rent currently, because I live in an apartment that is owned by my family.  My jobs usually don't last very long, and I am able to go for long stretches between them without working.

Even as I'm writing this, it sounds pretty nice, but the truth is actually a lot dimmer.  I struggle constantly with insecurity, and I haven't been able to hang onto a relationship for more than a few months.  I'm always searching for purpose, because my life seems meaningless at times.  I spend a lot of my days acting out on addictions, just trying to get away from the feeling that I am wasting my life.  I don't HAVE to create anything productive, I don't HAVE to add value to the world... so why do it?  I feel insecure about my place in this world, because I haven't really earned it yet.

I'm not saying to stay in a job you hate, or that reaching for FIRE is a bad goal... but being financially independent, retiring early, not having to work... none of those things in themselves will make you happy.  You will just have a different set of problems to deal with.

I hope this doesn't offend anybody here.  I wish you the best of luck on your goals, and I hope your financial dreams come true.

878,Did free cash drive people to quit work? Not according to a new study of Ontario’s basic income experiment,,871,fe26z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fe26z3/did_free_cash_drive_people_to_quit_work_not/,1583442740.0,"https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/gta/2020/03/04/did-free-cash-drive-people-to-quit-work-not-according-to-a-new-study-of-ontarios-basic-income-experiment.html



I posted this article because I feel like it parallels one of the main benefits of FI – More freedom to pursue jobs and activities that you deem as higher value.

 

To briefly summarize, there was a pilot project in Ontario that saw roughly 4000 people receive universal basic incomes (UBI) over the course of 13-17 months.  It would have been a 3-year study, but the provincial government decided to scrap the program half-way through.  So take the results with a grain of salt.  That said, the items that stuck out as most interesting were that:

 

1. Three quarters of people continued to work while receiving UBI.  

What does this tell us?  It could mean that these people derived value other than money from their jobs.  However, I'd say it's difficult to definitively conclude that since participants were aware that this was a short-term study and that after 3 years, the UBI would stop.  Work would be necessary for them once the UBI stopped, and if they quit their jobs now, they'd be three years ""behind"" in their savings/careers.  The amount of UBI paid (generally $17k CAD /year per person, $24k CAD /year for couples) may have also been a factor as to why most participants continued to work.
 
 
2. Of the three quarters of people who continued to work, more than one third were able to move to higher paying and more secure jobs.  

This to me is the most telling.  It seems like these people were able to take more risks in their jobs to move to better positions, or were able to leave precarious/toxic jobs and move onto something better.  Anecdotal accounts of that are within the article.  I think this is the point that mirrors FI the most.  Without having to worry about your next paycheque as much, you have more freedom to explore your ""highest and best use"", or at least find better employment.  You're no longer beholden to a bad job.  I've seen members on this subreddit express the same sentiments – freedom to find better employment since money is no longer an incumbrance.
 

I'd be curious to get people's views on this article, or UBI in general.  How would UBI impact FIRE, if at all?",financialindependence
879,A dispatch from the boring middle,,866,cgeori,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cgeori/a_dispatch_from_the_boring_middle/,1563809551.0,"Long time listener, first time caller.. 

I have been lurking on this forum for a few years, and have gotten a lot from the conversation, and wanted to add some thoughts that could hopefully be helpful to people ready. My wife and I are chugging along, and have a current NW of around 1.5 million. We are hoping to at least consider early retirement in 5 - 10 years. In the meantime, we are working hard and living life. Thoughts:

1. The details matter less than the general idea: I've had fun reading about bond tents and monte carlo simulations, and VTSAX, etc. It seems to me, though, that the most important idea in this forum is a simple one: there is an overwhelming advantage, both financial and intangible, to accumulating wealth early in life, and that advantage is available to anyone who is willing to be disciplined, work hard, and take some time to save. All of the other details of investment strategy seem to pale in comparison to this general idea. If you are committed to saving, and take a little time to set up a plan that does automatic deposits/investments, everything else finance-wise will probably take care of itself. 

2. Five year plans are good things: there is a quote somewhere that people overestimate what can be done in a year, and underestimate what can be done in a decade. I've always thought that 10 years was too long to plan for, but 5 seems like a good middle ground - long enough to allow for ambitious plans, and short enough to be a horizon that you can see. What goes in a plan? It doesn't have to just be the amount of money you want in five years - ours had things like, pay down mortgage, go on more vacations, figure out insurance, sync our finances better, etc. A one or two page word doc with your desires in life and action steps will go a long way in pointing you towards whats next. 

3. A financial planner can have some use: I know this forum is not always down with paying a planner, and that makes sense. You shouldn't need to pay someone to manage assets if they are invested in a straight-forward and simple way. Let me suggest a few things that have been helpful for us that a financial planner has done: 1. resolve family disputes/help us make decisions. If you are married or in a serious relationship, a planner is an easy way to actually get some decisions made and get stuff done, as it is at least a third party looking at your finances. 2. getting your whole house in order. A good planner will help you check all the boxes in your adult life - insurance, wills, retirement, etc. We have a fee-only planner that we have on retainer for essentially $250/month. He was more useful at the beginning of our process, but even now we find ourselves calling him occasionally for advice. 

4. Joining the 'professional class' is probably the most straightforward way to FIRE: I see a lot of young people on this forum - if you are wondering what to do with your life, I don't have that much advice to give.. That being said, getting an advanced degree in medicine, law or business is probably the most guaranteed path towards financial security. It's not 'easy' - you have to work for the money you make. (The 'easy' way to FIRE is to inherit a bunch of money from your folks..) But, other than tech fields, being a lawyer, doctor, or MBA business type is the path that will get you from nothing to something in the most straightforward way. 

5. Kids do change everything: we've got two young kids, and they do affect every aspect of your life (mostly they mean you have a lot less free time). There is a lot of discussion about the financial impact of children - this is all well and good, but they do change your lives in more fundamental ways than your checkbook balance. Ultimately, having kids means having young people in your life that are amazing and loving and awesome to be around, but also headaches and constant concerns. Your motivations and what you want to do with your free time will change dramatically. I have lots of family/friends who do not have kids, and they are also happy, but if you are considering kids or wondering what they mean, just know that you will probably need to reassess your plans before and after.. 

Anyway, those are my thoughts for now. I hope they are useful to people. Thanks!",financialindependence
880,There is so much resistance to passive trading as a Korean.,,866,dh5cv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dh5cv0/there_is_so_much_resistance_to_passive_trading_as/,1570937416.0,"Just want to share my observations as someone trying to get into passive investing in Korea as a Korean. 

I read a lot of FIRE stuff thats all the rage in english media and wanted to get into that myself.

One thing i noticed about trying to do that as a korean is the amount of resistance you will face.

First off etf's and indexs are almost never advertised or mentioned when you go in for consulting (if consulting even exists). They will usually pitch financial packages that lock you in for 10 to 20 years where they promise an annual return of 2% ""guaranteed"" for a safe option. This was from samsung one of the larger financial management services available here. 

When asked about etf's or index fund options tracking the S&P 500 they begrudgingly acknowledge its existence but quickly go on to say how risky it is and how nobody is managing it. That you are at the mercy of the markets. *ghost emoji* 

Even using a conservative metric of 4% average annual return long term they balk at the figure. Claiming that they regularly make 20 ~ 30 % returns on a 6 month basis with their managers. 

Even looking up several s&p 500 etfs offered by a few investment firms they clearly and prominently label the s&p 500 index fund as high risk. Practically one step away from bitcoin. 

https://i.imgur.com/5Vj1Jv3.png

I told them the whole spiel about trying to avoid fees and how most managers can't beat the market. That if the S&P 500 containing the top 500 US firms in an extremely globalized world were to permanently collapse it would practically be the end of the world in which ""safe"" assets like cash and real estate would likely lose value dramatically as well (especially non US monopoly money like the korean won). They usually dont have a response.

Even going into korean investment apps signs of resistance, dark spaces and nudging towards more high risk trading are prevalent. 
The mobile app of kiwoom investments only show hourly and daily fluctuations which contribute to a sense of nervousness to encourage frequent trading. Again the claims of 20~30% gains in 6 months from now predictions are prominently displayed (all of them managed funds of course). Lots of leveraged and margin stock options prominently at the front and even deceptively added at the end of fund titles like S&P 500 index fund^^leveraged. -> i almost clicked this those fuckers. 

This is not even mentioning how hard it is to find the index funds and etfs on their search function, usually requiring exact queries and multiple tries before the right one pops up. Of course the other more high risk funds keep popping up. 

Anyways those are my observations. 

Thank your lucky stars for companies like vanguard and robin hood.

But in 2017 I did miserably - only saving 18% of my income when I'd planned for 40%. This year I got really close - did 33% which in numbers was double the amount!! There were some medical expenses that prevented more saving + I really love going out drinking and I didn't have the discipline to reduce it as much as I wanted. 

New things that I did this year: 

* didn't touch my bonus - saved all of it
* increased my credit card repayment minimum (almost fully repaid)
* made sure I have an untouchable emergency fund of 3mo income
* doubled the automatic transfer to a retirement account - in my country I cannot invest in the market either local or international (we're kind of isolated like that) so my only option is stupid retirement accounts with banks or insurance.
* stopped traveling on vacation
* went out less & to less expensive places; drank less per night out, and stopped eating out.

So basically in 2016 42% of my income went to savings + supporting my parents and 58% to general expenses whereas this year I reversed it and 58% is going to savings and parents. 

For next year I'll be looking to do maybe 45% saved (at least 40%) and definitely reduce what I can in expenses. I'll also shop around for better interest rates with banks. I'll try to get seasonal work that I could do during vacation - this would help for small extras. I will also try to get a decent raise from work. I don't know what I could do further, I already live with parents and don't have a car. Might you guys have some ideas? ",financialindependence

I find this pretty strange. Maybe I have just had quite different life experiences than others.

Grew up lower-middle class. Paid for my own schooling. I've been 'living cheap' for years before finding out about FIRE. During this time I've had a few different living situations. Maybe we can have a discussion about how to find good people and situations.

In school: I joined an engineering fraternity. Living in the frat house was not terribly expensive, and I was surrounded by people who were always messing around building electronics projects or lighting things on fire. It was great. Lots to do all the time, not necessary to spend tons of money.

First place out of school: Shared an apartment with a bunch of people just out of school. Low standards, but we were all friendly and did stuff together.

Second place: Cheap condo (Bought for $32,000, $0 down. Lol. Gotta love Rockford, IL). Made friends with some of the other condo residents, and people from work. Place was cheap because it was close to downtown and in a more dangerous neighborhood, but I never had any issues and I could go downtown to markets and the river bike path and whatnot. During this time I was being sent overseas for work all the time so I was having my fun traveling.

Third place: Bought a house. Got a roommate - an engineer about my age from the place I worked. We ended up setting up a little maker lab in the basement. Our computers down there, a 3D printer, electronics kits. It was great! People came over and we did stuff together!

Moved to Seattle:  Holy shit what a cost of living adjustment. Rented a room in a house for a while to figure out how I would manage to live here. Eventually set up my current situation. I live on a small boat now in a trendy Seattle neighborhood, and have two shipping containers in an adjacent industrial yard. (Boat cost $4000, slip rental $430/mo, containers cost $2500 each, yard space rental $150/mo). In the yard, there are all sorts of weirdos with their own containers set up as shops and hangout spaces. Hippies, artists, craftsmen, drunks. There is a working art foundry, wood shops, a glass studio, and a communal compound made of stacked shipping containers where we have shows and parties.

For me, these were the kind of people I've been waiting to find. Always interesting, super community minded, friendly. Between the marina and the yard, we have cookouts together all the time. Some people bring meat, some bring veggies, some bring alcohol. Its good cheap fun! When we do go to a restaurant, we eat 'family style' at places that aren't family style. We'll buy two appetizers and two dinners for six people and share around. I dunno man, we're shameless I guess. Maybe other people would cringe at this, but whatever. We go to the same places often and know the servers and they like us.

How did I get into this? I just decided ""I want to live on a boat. What do I need to do to make this happen?"" That led to me visiting different marinas, meeting people, finding out about Seattle industrial yard culture (lol), buying a boat, getting to know the marina manager well, getting liveaboard permission from the marina, getting space in the yard, buying a container, etc.

What I would say to take from my experience so far is that there are so many different types of people out there who do not want to spend money at the bars, and you have to look for them. In my opinion, by chasing interests and OFFERING TO HELP.

Seattle examples: I could have started with an area maker lab, then found Equinox Studios in Georgetown, talked to people there, helped someone out with art/industrial projects and shows like Dead Baby and Georgetown Art Attack/Equinox Open House.. Or starting with Fremont Arts Council and volunteering on a Solstice parade float, then getting involved with Moisture Festival, then making an exhibit for Science Night at Hale's.. Or volunteering at the Center for Wooden Boats, getting to know the full time volunteers, getting to know the volunteers on the other historic boats, hanging out with them watching the sunset over Lake Union from the deck of a 130 year old tugboat. I do all this stuff. None of this costs real money! When I was hanging out with the boat volunteers (who ranged in age from 20's-50's in case you are curious), we walked to a grocery store, bought some cheap food and alcohol, and made dinner together on the boat! That was our night out and it was plenty more fun than a loud expensive bar.

I'm not a 'cool' guy or an awesome artist or anything. I (very) often feel that I'm not interesting enough to be part of the groups that I'm a part of. But I show up and contribute and am positive. And I have tons of cheap fun! Is this helpful?",financialindependence

In the meantime, I think around 2011 or so, I discovered the whole FIRE/ERE subculture. My first taste was a news article about the Dividend Mantra guy that claimed you could retire on something like $300k. I then discovered MMM, Lacking Ambition, Mad Fientist and a few other good blogs that pushed FIRE principles. I enjoyed reading MMM in particular, railing against  brainwashed consumers and traditional ideas of retirement, breaking things down with simple math and a straight-forward writing style.

I applied FIRE principles to my life. I’ve spent countless hours managing my investments, tracking my spending, creating spreadsheets, and running models in FireCalc and CFireSim. I’ve also spent countless hours reading blogs by people who have made it to FIRE, dreaming about how awesome my life will be when I make it. I’ve fallen off the wagon a few times, and had a few investments go south, but in general I’ve stuck with the program, and I’m now much better off for it. I am way ahead of the game when it comes to retirement and managing my personal finances. I could probably pull the trigger now with a fairly high confidence level, especially if I leaned a bit more towards the LeanFIRE model (pun intended) or was willing to work part time.

However, after focusing on FIRE for these past 5 or so years, I’m starting to wonder if I have just been using the pursuit of FIRE to distract myself from more fundamental problems in my life. I realize that FIRE is merely a means to an end, that end being freedom from having to give your time to others. However, I’m wondering if I treat FIRE more like a solution in and of itself. I suspect I may be subconsciously telling myself that as soon as I hit the magic number, everything will be awesome. I further suspect that the pursuit of FIRE may actually make things worse because it distracts me from confronting the real issues head on, and is basically a rationalization for prolonging a negative situation.

My basic problem, which I think may be shared by many who fixate on FIRE, is that I’m unhappy with my present situation. I spend the majority of my waking hours doing shit that I don’t want to do. My “career” doesn’t add any meaning or purpose to my life. It’s just something I force myself to do every day for a paycheck. So how do I fix this problem? My answer so far has been to count my pennies and  dream of the magical nirvana of financial independence. But isn’t this just a temporary distraction? How does sitting around daydreaming about being independently wealthy fix the underlying problem? FIRE won’t make me happy. It will just make me wealthy. And when I get there, the same problem that motivated me to get into FIRE will be waiting on the other side. What do I want to do with my life? What makes me happy? 

I don’t want to distract myself with spreadsheets any more. I want to tackle the problem head on. I want to find my purpose, and just let the money figure itself out. Thanks to FIRE principles I’m a bit richer and I’m not a brainwashed consumer, but FIRE isn’t the real answer to my problems. I’m an unhappy corporate lawyer who feels like his life doesn’t have meaning. What the fuck do I do? Where is the subreddit for finding meaning in life? Getting to FIRE is easy compared to figuring out what makes you happy.

I’m on the verge of financial independence, maybe within the next 2-3 years. I have no hobbies, no side hustles, no activities that I’m particularly passionate about. I’m just a cog in the corporate machine who has spent the last ten years of his life pushing paper and collecting a paycheck. How do I break out of the machine and find something worth doing?

TLDR:  Pursuit of FIRE is just a distraction from the present problem that I’m unhappy with my situation. How do I find out what to do with my life now?",financialindependence

In the year leading up to my ""retirement"", I put together a list of projects a mile long. Things I really wanted to do. Things I had the skills to do (or needed to improve, but only on the edges of my capacity). Things I wanted to learn from scratch. Routine things like regular exercise that I wanted to improve.

A year later, I've completed none of it. I'm not really sure what happens to most of my days. The first few months were great, I spent my time reading and drinking coffee, telling myself it was the ""decompression period."" Somewhere in there I have fallen in to a sort of depression: some combination of the lack of structure, the loose timelines on everything and the reduced pressure is going to take some serious learning to get over. My health feels worse than ever (though there was a period near the beginning where it was clearly best ever), but this is probably just my poor mental state.

Here are some challenges I've got from not managing my mental state well. I expect these could be similar among many people who fit in my demographic -- high energy/career successful professionals. 

- Totally irrational fears: it turns out that with nothing urgent to deal with or worry about, I manage to create things to worry about. They're usually obviously unrealistic/low probability.
- Difficult to motivate any particular project: I have so many projects, but none that I'm sitting around a table with colleagues agreeing are the priority. With no one to disappoint, it has been difficult to motivate working on any particular one. This is particularly interesting because I would have described myself as intrinsically motivated, prior to this experience.
- Yo-yoing behavior. An extension of not being able to motivate any particular project is this level of ADD-style project selection. Start one, move on to a different one, go back, over and over again. I've made nearly no measurable progress on anything due to a lack of focus.

I'm not really looking for advice (though, if you have it, that's cool). I just felt my story might resonate with some. 

Here's a cool observation: I retired at 120% of my (pretty lean) FI budget (just over 3.5%). I worked with a pretty lean number, because I always knew I was going to go back to work, do more small business activity, consult or something eventually. I'm now, about a year later, at 145% (my withdrawal rate is expected to be less than 3% now). A combination of unexpected income early in the process, unexpected values like my banked vacation time and tax return and a very small amount of small business stuff I have continued doing, combined with great market returns added up to be a straightforward numerical success.

This does not include the value of my $27k per year non-COLA pension which will kick in at age 65 (that's 17 years from now, God willing).

By any discernible measure, we could spend our days doing whatever we wish, which was the motivation for FI in the first place.  Yet, our respective grinds continue.  Neither of us are particularly enamored with our work but are highly competent and thus paid well.

We ratcheted down our lifestyle a while back ""to hasten FI"" ...  which flat out sucked.  So, we ratcheted up our lifestyle again ... which has been great and a return to normalcy for us.  And, 2.5% SWR is where we presently stand, even after re-inflating our lifestyle.

I am beginning to wonder if I, specifically, have some mental hurdle that I will never clear.  I daydream about hiking national parks, reading, oil painting, learning a new instrument or volunteering my time for financial literacy causes.  Instead, I find myself making (SUPER) dull drives across the Midwest, making sales calls and staying in Marriott Courtyards.  The corporate minions are pleased but, more and more, I am not.  It is as though I am experiencing an inverse relationship between our net worth and my job satisfaction and, in turn, my general happiness.  

To change things up with work, I recently moved to a sexier division (more attractive technology) and this does not seem to be hitting the mark either.  It is the same game with a different widget and a bigger paycheck.  It is exceedingly difficult to stay motivated when we have already won the game.

If anyone has been in a similar situation then I am all ears.  How did you get off of the hamster wheel?

892,"FIRE: 2 years in, a few (more) reflections",,851,etgc2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/etgc2q/fire_2_years_in_a_few_more_reflections/,1579898753.0,"Last year I wrote a reflection on my first year of FIRE. It got a lot of traction and seemed well liked so I thought I’d write the year 2 version… [Here is the first one if you want to see it:]( https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b2bfko/fire_1_year_in_a_few_reflections/)

My background: I’m a scientist in my mid 40’s who got into the big data side of tech just as it took off. I worked for a few large companies, and a few small companies, both as an FTE and consultant. During one of my “no job, no consulting” periods in the late fall (notoriously hard time to find a new job as everyone is on vacation, spent their budgets, etc.) I fell deep into the bitcoin rabbit hole researching what it was, what it might become etc. I bought in a few times and sold my holdings in December 2017 (not at the peak, but close) for about 1.5M. I had saved a shit-ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I never spend other than buying/fixing up my house. The FIRE idea was natural to me – I had an instinctual aversion to debt, simple tastes, and grew up without a lot (but didn’t feel like that was an issue). My job was not really going in a direction I liked, and I had just cashed over a million post-tax cryptobucks so I quit. I figured I’d try being unemployed, maybe call it “semi-retirement”? With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had close to 4M. Since retirement my portfolio has grown an additional 10% (after my living expenses) to 4.4M.


**Reflection 1: I’m not scared of the market anymore**

Maybe “scared” is too strong a word. Right after I quit my job, the market started dropping. Everyone says “don’t watch the market” but I couldn’t help it. I JUST STARTED the next phase after all. Well, everyone is right – ignore that shit. I felt a little bit off at first – and I mention that in the first post last year. Now… it truly is not a big deal to me, I just grab the data once a month because I like to track it. I have a balanced portfolio and plenty of time. Not worth the sweating over. I feel I am truly ready for whatever the next real drop ends up looking like.

**Reflection 2: I’m used to the lack of cash flow now**

After watching my bank account grow twice a month, and having to move money into investments every so often, I got used to it. Not having that as part of my financial journey anymore felt weird. Having to take cash (from dividend payments – this is my primary cash flow source now) out of my account to fatten up my bank account felt super weird (money goes IN there, not OUT from there.) I had tracked my spending for several years prior to FIRE, and now that I am there I also tracked it and I basically spend the same amount so moving cash to the savings account every once in a while is the new norm. 

**Reflection 3: I’m willing to spend some of that money (wisely) now**

At first I felt a little bit poor again – the money inflow was slow, new, weird. I didn’t want to mess it all up somehow. I’ve never been a big spender to begin with, but it felt like I was “on a special budget” or something. Why the hell would I FIRE if it meant I had to act like a pauper to do so (respect to my LeanFIRE friends, but that’s not my deal)? So now I’m willing to dip in a bit to make things work for how my life is shaping up post-work. I moved to a new city (renting) and rented out my house back in the old city. I’m considering buying a house here. I might sell my other house in a few years. I have options and the money makes those options broader. I might not execute these moves with economic perfection, but the money I have makes me feel like some slippage is not going to wreck me. Up until now, I have considered the brokerage stocks to be on untouchable lockdown. That is no longer the case if I can convert the money into what I need to be happy here in this new city – and I realize now that I really hate renting.

**Reflection 4: Sometimes I feel like it isn’t quite enough (how the fuck)**

Some people will always complain that their lump of gold isn’t big enough, and I tend to think those people are pain in the ass jerks. That said, I realize that there are times I wish I had a bit more… to put into special projects or pursuits that did not dip into my block of savings. One Idea I have had is to do some pick-up work and use 100% of that money for special projects and no savings. I haven’t quite figured it out yet, as these are just ideas right now, but the big revelation is that I thought I’d be done with feeling like I needed (“wanted” is a better word honestly) any more money but if I am being honest, that is not the case.

**Reflection 5: I thought I might want to do some work – I was right**

I took on a little work, but not too much. I helped a friend define and scope out a professional pivot and we figured out a way to do some additional work together. Working with him after 16 months off was really fun, and reminded me that I have some pretty cool superpowers that others do not. I think maybe you get so used to doing your thing in your groove that it becomes hard to take a bystander view. Applying myself to his situation which had some overlap to my old work but was also novel in many ways, and adapting my strategic consulting on the fly was quite satisfying. Drinking whiskey while consulting might have helped. That kind of work makes me feel a particular kind of excitement that I don’t get in other places. I need to learn how to tap into that more.

**Reflection 6: It’s ok to do nothing sometimes**

While I always had a great work ethic, I’ve never been a person to endlessly grind. I appreciate quiet reflection time, or do nothing except stare at the water time. Now that I am FIRE, and only working every once in a while (seriously – not a lot) I can forgive myself if a day or more goes by and I haven’t done anything particularly useful. I no longer view it as “wasting time”. I also think of all the days I went to work, mucked with emails, cranked the levers of industry, and went home, made a fire and drank a beer and ask “how different, to me, truly, is what that *was* vs. what this *is* from a personal growth, usefulness, or other internal concept?” The answer is basically “they are the same.”

**In closing**

I’ve acclimated to my new method of financial cycles. The discomfort in the novel has faded. I’m in a bit of a spot where it’s hard to make certain types of plans due to my aging parents and the potential for radical changes in their lives that I want to be able to help them navigate. It’s not radically tying me down by any means, it just changes the scope from “100% complete autonomy and freedom” to something a little less so for a bit. 

I’ve taken up a bit of woodworking. I went to physical therapy for my lower back and have really focused on getting that in order – it feels better than it has in years! I cook a bit more. I read books. I write essays. I’m involved in an online community working on some future technology in the cryptographic space. I take a lot of walks. I’m never bored.  

I feel like I’m in **“phase 2: acclimate and relax.”** Happy to answer any questions.

895,A cautionary tale on active investing,,847,7w3ga0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7w3ga0/a_cautionary_tale_on_active_investing/,1518078782.0,"Hi all,
Just wanted to share my story to illustrate how important it is to stay the course.

I used to be a volatility trader.  That is, up until 2 days ago.

For those of you who are unacquainted with the short vol trade, it's essentially a bet that the S&P 500, the heart of the US economy, will stay calm or regain equilibrium after a shakeup.  It's amazingly profitable due to the natural mean reversion property of the VIX, and tailwinds from the way several of the volatility ETPs are structured.  Sounds solid, yes?  I thought so too.

100% of the time in the past, after a volatility event, products like XIV and SVXY would suffer a large drawdown, and then after some resolution is reached with the original catalyst (or enough time has passed, volatility gets crushed).  VIX futures begin to fall soon after to catch up with spot, and within mere weeks, XIV/SVXY recovers to its original price and then some!  So, buying on these dips and holding until a recovery became a rudimentary strategy that piqued many others' interests, and spawned a plethora of well-backtested indicators, algorithms, systems, a subreddit, really an entire community.  For many of us, including myself, our systems *were* the hedge.

The last week or two, volatility had been steadily rising in response to multiple recent events, and so I averaged down exactly as how my strategy would have me do, buying large chunks of XIV at what seemed to be support points.  By the time XIV was down to 122, I had run out of cash.  I was all in - not that it mattered, of course it would recover well beyond where it started - after all, it has done this *every single time* since the introduction of VIX futures 15 years ago.  To be fair, there were some warning signs such as an objectively terrible futures curve shape and the volatility of volatility products themselves.  I had overridden those signals in my system to chase the dip, against my better judgment!

All that changed Monday afternoon, right after 4 PM.  The price went from 99 to 20, all in a matter of 15 minutes after the closing bell, where no stop loss could have helped.  The indicative value of XIV was reported as being 4.22, an absurdly low number we all thought was a mistake at the time.  Turns out there was no mistake.  Both Feb and March VIX futures spiked up an unprecedented 110%, which never even happened during the Great Recession.  This basically destroyed short vol products in one fell swoop.  My final losses were 97%.

After I calmed down enough to think straight, I did some back-of-the-napkin math.  If I had simply taken the chunk of money earmarked for active trading, dumped it into VTSAX, and forgotten it existed, I'd be up $25k right now.  Instead, I'm down $56k.  More than an entire year's worth of working hard and frugally saving, obliterated.  8% erased from my FI/RE progress.

So, there you go.  As far as traders go, I'm probably a fair bit more sophisticated than your average mom-n-pop trend chaser.  I had deep knowledge of the products I was trading.  I've done my due diligence on the risks, created a risk model, quantified them, used that to create a system... but in the end, none of it helped.

I still don't know where I'm going after this.  Short vol is still a solid trade but it became immensely more risky in my eyes now since as the tail risk exposure feels much more real.  I expect the volatility complex itself to stay more volatile until the trade gets less crowded, and the market as a whole becomes healthier (consider that 74% of growth in the past 9 years came from corporate stock buybacks, purchased with money raised from debt offerings, only made possible by the absurdly low interest rates).

What should most people take away from this story?

**The stock market will shit on your face when you try to get smart with it.  Buy VTSAX and forget anything else exists.**

For myself, I don't know if I can go back after being redpilled.  I'm considering a core position of 80% /ES and 20% /ZN futures, rebalancing on a regular basis, and substitute with UPRO/TMF in places where I can't do futures.  I think my volatility trading system still has value, but I would use it with MUCH smaller allocations and hedged with far OTM VIX calls.

Thanks for listening.



**EDIT:**

Thanks for all the comments and feedback everybody.  I am a bit thrown off kilter by how unsupportive the majority of comments are... I'm just trying to show people what could happen if you get too cocky and greedy with a high-risk-high-reward trade, and that it's definitely not for everybody.  I just lost a ton, I realize I made mistakes, can you get off my case now?  If everybody who posts a cautionary tale gets insulted and downvoted they might as well not bother posting at all.

- Many are saying the strategy was fundamentally stupid to start with, but I feel like they literally don't understand the mechanics behind the trade and how to hedge risk.  I guess you think Citadel/Two Sigma/Jane Street/etc. are all stupid too? Look up who the top holders of XIV were.  I keep using that word 'hedge' over and over again, but, that was really the only thing needed to turn what was a total blowout into a minor setback.

- Another misconception people keep saying is that the prospectus plainly states the long-term EV of all volatility products is 0; keep in mind I do not hold these things long term.  I knew this, but XIV/SVXY aren't as much of a hot potato as you might expect due to the way it works and some properties of its underlying holdings, e.g. the lag between a spike in spot vix and a respective rise in the corresponding futures.  A key to this is because of greed I ignored the warning signs.

- Stop losses don't work overnight.  The reason for not getting out before EOD is because you'd otherwise be missing out on the majority of the movement which kinda defeats the purpose.

- Risk management is key, obviously.  My allocation was well justified; following the Kelly criterion would have me all-in, even when overstating the probability of a total loss.  The amount I lost hurt for sure, but it was the tractor, not the farm.",financialindependence

897,10 don'ts en route to FIRE,,843,dkmxlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dkmxlo/10_donts_en_route_to_fire/,1571593507.0,"These are my thoughts on things to avoid on the FIRE journey:

1. Don't invest in individual stocks. If you do make that mistake, try to keep it to around 5% of your investments. Get a broad US index, throw some international index in there if you must. Some bonds are OK too, depends on age. Don't invest in any get-rich-quick scheme. Your friend made moolah in some MLM, crypto, or some fantastical real estate deal? Tell them how awesome they are, smile, and forget that bullshit. Slow and steady accumulation has FAR better odds of success than trying to hit home-runs. Also, don't make money off of disadvantaging someone else...unless you are an asshole it won't sit right with you.
2. Don't look at the markets too often, check accounts once a week just to make sure you weren't hacked. Forget the silly peregrinations of the stock market. Don't look at the news often. Some subreddits are OK.
3. Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone is dealing with their own shit and these comparisons only serve to make you either feel worse, or to make sacrifices that don't enhance your happiness or well being. Your only competition is you from yesterday, and the only pill that helps with your mental well-being is progress (apart from an actual mental condition in which case please take your prescribed pills!).
4. Don't let money idle in a sub-1% checking/savings account. Get a high-yield savings account to sock extra monies
5. Don't ignore your health. Doesn't mean you have to be adonis or aphrodite, just that you take care of yourself a bit more.
6. Don't ignore nature. It makes a difference to be outdoors and connect with things that are not man-made.
7. Don't have toxic people in your life, including family. It is OK to cut them out!
8. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's not easy to adult, and you are doing just fine. You're doing great!
9. Don't ignore your career. Not all of us inherit or get lucky with some investment - most still earn their FIRE the old-fashioned way, earning and saving. Yes, work sucks - suck it up and try to contribute in ways you enjoy and fuck the office politics and bullshit. If you are truly miserable, start looking around and make a change. No such thing as ""loyalty"" to your employer (or vice versa) these days, look after yourself and better yourself.
10. Don't get lost in FIRE. Get a plan, set it and then forget it for weeks. Just check in every month or so.",financialindependence

Many folks here probably do that already, but it's not as common as I expected. We have a lot of discussion in the daily threads about guilty pleasures, purchases that are/aren't worth it, the value of vacations, and so forth.

I grew up, ""we can definitely buy food but we if the car breaks again we'll lose the house,"" lower-middle class. For my early adult years, I experienced intense guilt whenever I made any kind of purchase. Surprisingly, this didn't go away once I broke into earning six figures. Non-stop buyers' remorse, even over good purchases. The guilt of a $30 brunch negated any enjoyment of such a luxury.

**Eventually, I created a checking account exclusively for guilt-free spending.** Every paycheck, I automatically put $X into it. When I got raises, I would funnel 80% of the raise into savings/investment accounts and 20% into the lifestyle/fun-money account. Managed lifestyle creep.

Now, I feel zero guilt when I buy things from that account. It's factored into my FIRE plan, after all. It's part of the budget, just like vanguard, just like monthly bills. Fancy cocktails? Zero guilt. New phone? Gravy. All-inclusive vacation with my wife? If the account stays > $0, we could afford it.

I went through college and dental school on full and then partial scholarship so I paid a little less than $100k for my education. Between past work, a general practice residency and about a year of private practice, I have paid off my loans and saved up about $150k. I had initially saved in preparation to pay tuition for a residency in endodontics but I did not get in this year.

I have found that I enjoy general dentistry. I'm good with patients and the procedures are easy and enjoyable. However, as an extreme introvert, I find serving patients to be mentally and emotionally draining to the point where I can do nothing else on the days I am working. I have also realized that I am content living frugally and value my time more than money. I am not sure if I want to double down on my investment in dentistry by taking another shot at endodontics residency or purchasing a practice at this time.

I am thinking about cutting back to working a job with a 3 day or a relaxed 4 day workweek for a few years. This will give me more free time and longer weekends to pursue hobbies and hang out with my friends. I feel that I have sacrificed a lot of my youth to get to this point and I want to enjoy more of what remains of it. I am single and don't plan on having kids in the near future.

Would it be prudent for me to cut back to the point where my job is more of a hobby or should I push to build more capital while I'm young, healthy, and have the capacity to earn and save?",financialindependence

Maybe this should go in r/offmychest, but here I am...

&#x200B;

A little history/background about myself:

* My family moved to the US from Asia when I was a baby. Didn't have much savings. My family has been poor long before I came into the picture. My mom moved me and 3 of my brothers to the US because my dad's father was sick and he wanted to be close.
* When we got here, my parents' marriage deteriorated due to an affair my father had and they got divorced. Mom received child support.
* Mom worked 2 jobs to put food on the table. Once she passed 50, she found it hard to find work. I remembered going days without eating. My brother would take the car and go party with his friends... I guess it was his way of escaping this life. Mom and I couldn't get to the grocery store. Our fridge didn't work, so we couldn't keep fresh food in the house. Lots of roaches. We didn't have heat in the house nor hot water to take showers. We basically had enough for the mortgage and that was it. She was too proud to ask for assistance and I'm not even sure we qualified because she was not a citizen.
* As I grew older, my brothers moved out of the house. After nearly a decade of financial struggles since the divorce, my mom started a restaurant. I worked in it from ages 10 - 18 despite child labor laws. My mom refused to hire enough people and refused to pay me my wages when I could legally work (Age 16). What little I made in tips, I saved. I didn't have a social life in high school because I worked 40+ hours a week. I barely had the energy to study or finish homework because I worked so much. I would get called stupid by some teachers because I seemed so lost during lectures, which totally shot my confidence. I had to drive myself 2+ hours away to take the SAT that started at 7 AM because the testing center in my town filled up. My mom took no interest in my academic success. Needless to say, I bombed it and didn't get into the colleges I wanted. I busted my ass the last year of high school and took AP classes to prepare myself for college. She wanted me to stay and help her run the family business, but I needed to get out of there. We fought a lot. She would guilt me and tell me, ""This will all be yours someday."" And, ""I'm doing this for you."" Since my brothers all left and didn't help her. She took advantage of them, too.
* I have this one brother that used my family and me like a piggy bank. He didn't graduate from college and took meager jobs. He's horrible at managing money. Even when he did have a well-paying job at $60k+ a year, he'd blow it all. Then ask us for money. If we wouldn't give it to him, he'd threaten suicide. I remember being 6 years old and begging him not to kill himself over the phone. Once he gets money, you don't hear from him until the next time he wants some. I remember giving him $200 here and there from when I was 14 until I finally put my foot down at 26. He would always call and say he needs money ASAP and that he's living in his car and he needs to eat NOW and get a hotel room so he can shower. You'd have to spend extra and wire the money via Western Union. After you wired it over, he would confirm he received it, wouldn't even say thank you. You wouldn't even hear from him until the next time he needed money. I refuse to give him money anymore, but my mom will still give him a few hundred dollars here and there.
* When I moved away to college at 18, I basically didn't have a job just to give myself a ""vacation"". I just went to school. However, my parents didn't help me with tuition or expenses, so I ran out of the money I saved quickly. I got a part-time job at the university in order to pay the rent and have food to eat. It was just minimum wage. After a year or two,  I asked for some money to fix my car, my mom wouldn't give it to me. She had been collecting my child support from my father without giving me a cent.  $500 a month would have helped me pay rent and have food and maybe some more to save for fixing my car when it would break down. As a result, I took out extra student loans just to make things work. I know it was really stupid, but I didn't have choices. I would go to the food bank at a nearby church and spend $30 on an allotment of food.
* In 2010, I graduated after a hard road of working full-time and going to school full-time (it extended my graduation date by a year.) But I was the first in my family to do so. Unfortunately, I graduated at a pretty rough time in the economy and struggled to land a job. Even though I had been employed in the IT department at my university for 5 years, it seemed it wasn't enough. I decided to go back and get my MBA after 6 months of searching.
* During the time I went to grad school, my mom sold her restaurant after almost running it into the ground. As a business student, I tried to help her and would make suggestions in order to increase profitability. She was too proud to take my advice. She walked away with probably about 25% of what she wanted to sell it for.
* I worked full-time during my MBA. I researched, networked, and cold-called; landed my first job in private equity. I got paid almost nothing, but it was good experience. I convinced them to give me a 3-month internship even though they weren't hiring. I did really well and they decided to keep me on another 3 months. But unfortunately, once a large acquisition went through, they didn't need my extra help anymore and ended my internship. I cold-called places again and landed another PE job in an even smaller shop with even fewer employees. It only lasted 2 months before they couldn't sustain me as an employee anymore.
* A few months later, I graduated and went into another field and had probably one of the worst work experience I've had up until that point. The boss would mock other employees in our management meetings (I was one of the managers). The work environment was very stressful and it seemed he hired as few people as possible and stretched them to work insane hours to get projects done on time. I couldn't take the negative environment, so I left after 2 months. I went on a huge anxiety/depression bout and had a long stint of unemployment... 1.5 years. I lost 10% of my body weight and a lot of sleep. I had panic attacks almost daily. It was a horrible time, but I went to therapy and pulled myself out of it after a year.
* From there, I had landed a temp job at another company in their finance department. I got paid $14/hr which was still only $2 less per hour than my previous job. I loved it there, though and busted my ass. I secured a full-time job with benefits and raised my wage to almost $24/hr.
* Unfortunately, 6 months after my promotion, they moved my job overseas. I wanted to go back to the company though, so I basically took the first job that sounded remotely interesting to me. The pay was $18/hr but I wanted to continue my career there, so I took the pay cut. It was in a different department, and I found out that the old department that I worked in was going to be completely offshored, but they all got to keep their jobs as they transitioned things over the course of 2 years. Turns out, my new job was the worst work environment to date. This boss was 10x worse than the other bad one I had. She would mock employees using speech impediments, berate employees in front of the group, create an ""us vs. them"" culture with other departments, and encourage her subordinates to be mean to other departments. She was notorious for being extremely mean and tenacious. She would ridicule me and others in the middle of meetings. I stuck this out for a few months but went back to therapy after losing sleep and getting my panic attacks again. A few months later, I went to my doctor and he immediately took me out of work the same day and put me on STD for 3 months. He said the stress was doing horrible things to my body. I came back 3 months later and had better tools gained in therapy to help me cope with the environment. Unfortunately, it was still terrible despite me going to HR and reporting my boss' bad behavior throughout the past year. I couldn't take it anymore and decided to quit after 1.3 years.

&#x200B;

Now:

* I am 32F. Unemployed. Feeling dismal about my situation.
* I feel like my life has been a constant struggle and it seems like I seldom have a good thing going for very long before something catastrophic happens.
* I've never made over $36k in a year.
* I know it's not good to compare myself to others, but I've worked my ass off and still have a hard time seeing the benefits of doing so. My NW is barely $33k. I feel like FI is so far away and that I'll never get there when I want to. I read posts on here and see the ""*I'm 22 and I have $70k in NW and I'm sad*"" posts and I just want to scream. My NW is half of that and I am a WHOLE DECADE OLDER. Makes me feel like shit, honestly.
* I live with my boyfriend and he basically allows me to live here rent-free. (We live in a $90k condo and he makes $80k - 90k/yr and has been for the past 6 years).  I do what I can to help out and do all of the cooking, trying to cut down on the food budget. We've been together almost 11 years now and he's helped me through so much. I'm very grateful to him and I feel like if he wasn't here, I wouldn't be able to make it. I feel guilty and I try to have lots of conversations with him about rent, but he always tells me not to worry about it.
* Right now, I am learning new skills and applying for jobs like crazy. But I feel this cloud looming over that I'm somehow flawed and unable to make more money. I've felt that I've always had to take a lower wage for the sake of experience. But it seems as if it has never paid off. I feel like every 3 steps forward, I take 2 back.
* I'm just so FRUSTRATED. It feels like FI is so far away and I'm so sick of seeing posts of people doing so much better than me. As I've said, I know it's not good to compare yourself to others, but I catch myself doing it a lot and I just get really depressed and cry.

&#x200B;

I think this was just a way for me to vent. Maybe I want advice? Maybe you want to commiserate with me? Maybe you want to tell me to suck it up and stop being such a bitch? All I know is I just feel awful and I know I should be grateful for what I do have, but it just gets so hard sometimes and I don't know what the problem is.

Thanks for reading, friend.

**UPDATE 5/13/2019:**

Wow! Let me just say the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I am very grateful for all the kind words and encouragement! It also has helped me open my eyes to see that I am actually doing great :)

With all I've been through, you would think I would remember how far I've come. But maybe I bury the past because I don't like the feelings it stirs up; stress, worry, lack. I will try to address these in therapy. I think it is key to moving past this barrier. Part of the reason why I wanted to spill out all this history was to show myself what I've been through. It may sound like I'm just a complainer, but it was truly cathartic. And with everyone's positive responses, it helped me see that I really have made it far even if I am not exactly where I want to be. I just have lofty expectations. Thanks for reading what you did and I hope you get some benefit out of it.

**If nothing else, I hope people in my similar situation read this and see that it's not always as easy. I think the majority of posts on here paint this picture that FI is just getting a good job and saving more than the average person. But that in and of itself is not as easy as it seems. For the posts that say, ""I have a $X NW at Age XX"", we seem to just see the numbers and don't really see all the hard work and sacrifice that really goes into it.**

As for my boyfriend, he gets a daily hug and extra squeeze from me when I go through harder times. He is unwavering in his support... A shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen, and offers great advice. I let him know how grateful I am to him as much as possible. He really is awesome :)

**FYI:**  Since some people have asked, I have a B.S. in Economics. I'm working toward a career that involves statistics and econ. I am currently taking R programming courses as well as SQL on DataCamp. I wouldn't be opposed to going back to finance, though, as I did enjoy all the jobs I've had in that field.",financialindependence

However the company is also not doing well and I am under a lot of pressure. Sure I am learning a lot but its like a sink or swim environment and I am not sure I will be able to swim long enough. 

With the economy slowdown, is anyone entertaining thoughts of just getting out of the rat race for 2020 and hope for better times in 2021? 

The two main concerns I have for this are:  

* Who knows whether the economy will bounce back by 2021. It could still be the same scenario only I am now more desperate for work.  
* Explaining the gap. Easier to do when you're self-employed for sure.  

Also, another point is that I can't really move to Thailand or Cambodia to ride out the winter in a LCOL country. Maybe this will change in a month or two.

904,My Mega Backdoor Roth setup experience with Fidelity,,839,f2kgq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f2kgq1/my_mega_backdoor_roth_setup_experience_with/,1581477076.0,"Me and my wife make more than 200k$ a year, so we don't qualify to contribute to Roth IRA. We were basically maxing out 401ks then sending everything else to our taxable Vanguard account.

I was always curious about the Mega backdoor Roth i.e a way for high income individuals/couples to contribute money to Roth so that it can grow tax free. Today I finally had time to research if my company offered this (thankfully they do!) and I set it up with Fidelity. I learnt a few things so I thought I'd share my experience with you guys:

Fidelity doesn't let anyone set this rollover on their own via their website etc. You need to call them to make any kind of change to your after tax contributions' rollovers. There are two ways of doing this.

1. You will have an after tax contribution option in your Fidelity account, if your employer allows you to contribute to after tax. You can contribute to this after tax, then call Fidelity periodically and ask them to move this your Roth at any time you want. IRS limits your pre tax contributions(19,500) + employer contributions + after tax contributions to 57k. So you can contribute (57k - 19.5k - employer contributions) as after tax contributions.

2. The problem with option 1 is that, any growth/dividend accumulated in the period between after tax contribution and the time you call Fidelity to roll it into your Roth 401k is taxable. Also calling them each time is a chore. To avoid this, you can call Fidelity to setup any after tax contributions to automatically be rolled over to your Roth 401k immediately, so that the gains are not taxed. The official term for this is ""automatic roth in-plan conversion""


EDIT: Adding/editing a few things I learned from this thread, for the year 2020:

1. I mistakenly assumed that my only option was the mega backdoor roth after maxing out my 401k, due to income limits. You can also open a traditional IRA, contribute 6k to it, then convert this to a Roth IRA - provided you don't have any other IRA. This is called backdoor Roth and can be done by anyone irrespective of employer. On top of this, if employers allow, you can do the mega backdoor roth which is what this post is about. So this brings the total tax advantaged contribution amount possible to 57k(pre+post tax via 401k) + 6k (via traditional IRA to Roth backdoor) + 3550 (HSA)

2. You can rollover your after tax 401k megabackdoor contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401k. Looks like rolling over to Roth IRA can to be done only manually each time. Rolling over to Roth 401k can be done automatically, if that is part of your employer's plan offering. The advantage of rolling over to Roth IRA is that you can access the contributions any time. You can only access the contributions from the Roth 401k when you leave your employer. In either case, accessing the contributions are tax free. In either case, accessing the gains will be tax/penalty free only by age 59.5. Before that, to access gains, you have to pay tax + penalty.

This makes us all targets for whalers, phishers, and other types of thieves. I've been getting deeper into security/privacy over the past few weeks, and I wanted to start a discussion on best practices to ensure that what we've earned doesn't end up stolen. I've found a useful podcast on the subject, though they tend towards an extreme that I don't find necessary (https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html). With that out of the way here are some best practices as I understand them, feel free to add more:

&nbsp;

- Use different usernames/passwords for all accounts (reddit, banks, CC companies, amazon, coinbase, etc...). If you used the same username/password for all accounts, a hack of one account opens your others to attack. Do not create a username that someone could guess, such as firstname.lastname, instead use something more random.
- Preferably, you will use a different email address and phone number for each class of accounts you activate. A phone number/email for craigslist/ebay, one for Reddit, one for Facebook, one for your bank, one for CCs, etc... This is made easier with apps such as sudo for IOS. The phone number is replacing the social security number as the universal identifier.
- Use 2FA when possible, and SMS doesn't really count as 2FA. Something like google authenticator is a more secure form of 2FA.
- If you're not churning or otherwise opening a lot of credit lines, freeze your credit.
- Software like lastpass can auto-generate strong passwords and encrypt them for you (so even if they are hacked your info should be secure).
- Consider messaging through a platform that is end to end encrypted (protonmail, signal, wire, etc...)
- Consider dropping Google and Facebook.
- Several apps allow for the generation of burner credit and debit cards (blur, sudopay, etc...)

That's the low hanging fruit as I understand it. I was already implementing several of these (the obvious ones), but have now transitioned to multiple VOIP phone numbers/emails as well as other security and obfuscation techniques.",financialindependence
907,"3-MONTH UPDATE: 35/m + 32/f + no kids with $1.65m net worth, semi-retiring",,840,ajc7uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ajc7uy/3month_update_35m_32f_no_kids_with_165m_net_worth/,1548335149.0,"It’s been about 3 months since my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9qohfj/35m_32f_no_kids_with_165m_net_worth_semiretiring/) which garnered a fair amount of attention, so I thought I would post an update for those interested.

Thus far, things have gone quite well. One of the biggest developments is my previous employer, who had offered me a lowball contracting rate which I rejected, came back to the table. We agreed on a fair rate and I’ve been averaging about 20 hours/week of work for them, while going on-site a few days per months. I’m very happy with this arrangement and they seem to be as well. In addition, I do about 5-10 hours/week for a former colleague. This feels like a good amount of work per week, and I’m looking to maintain that.

Otherwise, I’ve enjoyed the additional free time. My wife goes on morning walks and I try to join her frequently. When the weather was nice we went hiking once a week. It’s wonderful to go shopping in the middle of a weekday (although stores can still be surprisingly busy). I am very rarely bored. My wife struggles with this more than me. Obviously I am still doing a fair amount of work so that’s to be expected, but I think it’s also our personality types (she has said I’m easily entertained and that’s very true). She has considered either volunteering or finding a part-time job, and I’m supportive of either.

Regardless of this, I think both of us are happier--not hugely, but noticeably. We often comment that even if we’re bored, it’s so much better to be bored at home than stuck at work with nothing to do but having to act busy. I’ve also noticed that I no longer find myself dwelling on the next phase of our lives nearly as much. We had always planned to only stay here a year or two, but I’m not constantly thinking about that next move like I used to. And I guess this is obvious, but there feels like very little difference between weekdays and weekends now (one downside: that wonderful feeling of it being Friday is gone). The days seem to go slower, but since I’m enjoying them more, it’s a good thing.

With the rough stock market, our net worth had declined from ~$1.65m to ~$1.55m, but has mostly recovered. Anticipating this semi-retirement for a while, I had been doing a bont tent for the past few years and our asset allocation was down to ~50/50 stocks/bonds, so it didn’t affect us as much as it could have.

Another thing I’ll mention, which I’m sure is of interest to many here, is health insurance. I was fully prepared for the coverage to be poor, and for it to be a struggle to get much of anything paid for. What I _wasn’t_ prepared for is it being such a struggle just to get signed up! The healthcare.gov website worked pretty well. I knew all the rules and got everything submitted very early on. A few days before the first of the month when my coverage was supposed to begin, I called the insurance company just to confirm everything was ready to go. It was quite a rude awakening when they told me they had no information about my enrollment. Apparently it takes weeks to get that data from the Marketplace. Eventually it did come through, and the coverage was retroactive to the first of the month...but they somehow omitted my wife. It took all the way until the end of the month to get that resolved, and until the middle of the next month for the bill to be correct.",financialindependence

She gets money from a few sources, including a weekly allowance, gifts from relatives, and a small amount from working in my business. I require her to save 30% of everything she receives, which goes into her savings account. I show her how the account is growing, and I told her that once it gets to $3,000, she can invest it in the stock market (mutual fund).

Still, I'm not sure that this is making any sense to her. Does anyone have any success or failure stories when it came to teaching your now-grown children about money?

&#x200B;

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your advice, experience, anecdotes, snarky replies and funny stories! After reading every comment, these are the takeaways that will shape my next steps:

&#x200B;

1. Some people (or their kids) ""got it"" (saving and investing) at a young age - like kindergarten. Others got it in their 20s or later. Some said their kids still haven't gotten it. I conclude that, for my daughter, investing for the long term is probably too abstract at her age.
2. A LOT of you gave incentives/were incentivized to save (e.g. like matching savings) and make money (chores or jobs). There were a couple examples of the bucket system and games. One person mentioned charity. Great idea.
3. Many of you taught or learned through example, and said kids are ""always watching"" even if it isn't readily understood at the time. Not just finance stuff.
4. It is better to teach than to not teach. There is a risk of backfiring or it may not have any effect at all, but many wished their parents had guided them when they were young.
5. On a technical note, some questioned the $3k investing threshold. I was still stuck in the Vanguard minimums. When the time comes, we'll look at ETFs.
6. There are a lot of resources for teaching kids about money. Books and YouTube.

Given the above, I've decided that first I'm going to show her how to budget the money she has and will be receiving in the near future (like allowance). Investing was just putting the cart before the horse so to speak. I talked to her about budgeting yesterday, and she showed me a note she keeps on her phone. It lists her current savings and money coming in. So that was good. I'm also going to kill two birds with one stone and show her how to use Google Sheets. Will be good to keep track but also to teach her about spreadsheets in general (not just for finance). She's also focused on saving up for a new phone,  so that can ""anchor"" the lesson. 

Next, I'm going give her some incentives for saving. Not sure exactly what yet, but something like matching 50% of the savings she's accumulated by each birthday (Initially I wanted 100% but my wife laughed and said that by high school we might owe her all of our money lol).

Finally, I need to be a bit more aware of my own habits. There were a couple times when she didn't have any money with her and I had to loan her $5 or so until the end of the day. I'm going to stop doing that for the most part. Also, I owe her some money for gift cards that I bought from her, but I've been letting it float for too long. Kids are watching, right?

Actually just a couple more things about what I ""read into"" many comments. There is a LOT of love (sometimes tough love) passed from parents to their kids through money lessons. Parents have done what they can, but also stressed that kids need the freedom to make their own mistakes. Hearing all these stories was very encouraging. Kudos to the FI community!

I kinda took offense of that notion in the past. I thought to myself that if I save enough to encounter 10% vacancy, have a healthy reserve, I should be OK. Who would knew this Pandemic just threw all of these conventional RE wisdom in the trash.

A huge part of my post FIRE income would have come from my real estate investments. It's totally rocky right now with very uncertain future due to the shutdown. But I am still hoping for the best.

I did take this sub's recommendation and built a pretty sizable Cash/Bonds/Stocks mix. FireCalc showed that I have a 98% success rate to live off that stash for 20 years without any additional income.  I am in my early 40's. And yes, I am counting on some SS and a sizable ""inheritance"" (It's a house I bought for my parents in the 90's. It's paid off. I still own it.)

Since this pandemic, I took an unpaid leave from my job and it suppose to end after 3 months. It has been 6 weeks without any work and I am feeling the best!!!

I don’t have to do the stupid daily stand up to report to the higher being what I have been up to.  No more nagging emails from HR, my boss, compliance and IT department. ZERO stress! I get up every morning to have coffee and breakfast without getting rushed, situate my kid to the remote classroom, read news on my computer, go for a little nice walk, have home made lunch, take a nap, do a workout, watch movies, bake a dessert with my kid… Wow, I didn’t know life can be this good. The dreadful feeling that eventually I still have to return to work really puts me down. If only if I could count on my RE investment, I would have pulled the trigger with no hesitation.

Some FIRE folks said that it doesn't have to be 0% or 100%. Deep down, I really want to just take a chance. I am good for 20 years at least using my savings. My real estate income didn’t go down to 0 even in this hellish climate. 

What if I don't live very long? That would sucked real bad if I die prematurely. Maybe I should just take a chance and live a little. Humans are extremely resilient. We change, adapt and survive. It doesn't have to be one formula fits all.",financialindependence

914,"For those looking to ""Barista FI""",,828,9b0ce6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9b0ce6/for_those_looking_to_barista_fi/,1535473421.0,"I've seen a lot of discussions here and there about people looking to ""Barista FI"" but not wanting to actually be in a food service industry, and I thought I'd share something from my industry as an option.


 If you live near a luxury car dealership(Lexus, Audi, BMW, Benz, etc) they are usually always looking to hire delivery drivers for the sales and service departments. These drivers deliver cars to and from out of town, and even out of state customers. For instance, Bob lives 3hrs away from the dealership, but needs to bring his car in for service. Bob would rather pay for the dealer to bring him a loaner car, pick up his car, then return to swap cars again.

The industry standard in most dealerships I've worked in seems to be older, retired men who just want to make a little extra money. But we search constantly for drivers because many of these people have very limited availability, so we try to keep a pool of drivers to choose from. Work is basically served up like a courier service, you tell us when you're available, we call when there's a delivery, you tell us if you can make it. You get paid for mileage on deliveries. For long distance out of town deliveries, some of our drivers make $160 in a day for a 6hr trip, but most make 100-150 per day, doing 2 shorter distance deliveries. You can listen to audio books, etc while driving.

I just thought I'd share this, since it's not a well known job, but it is a position that's usually hiring at most dealers, and it has great earning potential for something where you could work as many or as few days as you'd like with tons of flexibility.

 A proper edit now that I'm at a computer:

 I'm not offering anyone a job, if you want to know if a dealer near you does this and is hiring, call them. 


 Most of these positions are not eligible for benefits, as others have pointed out. I was not aware there were part time positions that offered health insurance, so I didn't consider this a factor, but I'm adding this to ensure nobody goes into this EXPECTING benefits. Employment status and type is dependent on dealer, results will vary.

 You need a valid driver's license and clean driving record for at least the last 3 years to be considered, this is pretty standard but can vary. 

 You can be employed as either an employee or a 1099 contractor. Most of my experience indicates the former, though as others pointed out that may be the minority, and likely is since i live in a small city and have worked for small dealers. There is a high likelihood your dealer will offer this as a 1099 position. 

 This was never meant to be ""here is a great way to get benefits in part time employment"" and I didn't mean to lead anyone to believe that was the case. This was meant to alert people to an easy, laid back, super flexible job that pays well and has you dealing with nice people most of the time.

915,What taking 4.5 years off of work from age 27-31 looks like,,827,7yq4d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7yq4d9/what_taking_45_years_off_of_work_from_age_2731/,1519074113.0,"There's a lot of questions out there asking if it's OK to take 6 months off, etc, on this sub.  I took 4 and a half years off after spending almost 10 years in the military and charted my total after-tax income, total spending, and net worth during that time to give some perspective...  

[The end graph](https://i.imgur.com/qL2srkq.png)  

A few caveats...  

-Didn't really start tracking everything in detail until 2016.  Went back and re-created as much of the data prior to 2016 using bank statements and portfolio values.  Getting data prior to 2011 was a little trickier and especially prior to 2009 since my bank statements didn't go that far back.  Filled out as much as possible and extrapolated, but that's why data prior to 2011 looks a lot more smooth.  

-I did have a windfall traditional IRA that I inherited around 2012 (190K) that bumps my net worth up considerably more, but since I don't touch it and treat it like it isn't there for my day to day spending, I didn't include it in the chart.   

-Yes, it's an ugly excel chart, but the data is the important part... not the visualization.  

-The reasons there's no dip in 2008 is I was on military deployment at the time (Sep 2007 - Dec 2008) and was investing a great portion of my paycheck (the difference between spending and income on the chart becomes more pronounced when the deployment started)... so much so that I was outpacing the losses from the Great Recession.  

-Had another deployment from middle of 2010 to middle of 2011.  You can see a big dip in my spending there.  

-Ran some simulations of where my net worth would be if I didn't take the time off.  Well, I didn't really go off the deep end on FIRE until after my time off so it's hard to predict my spending habits, but my best estimates put it around $400K.  So the time off in the end cost me about $230K in current net worth.  With the windfall I have, I would be very close to $700K total net worth and would be looking to leanFIRE in the next few years.",financialindependence
916,Reflections on 1 year of early retirement,,823,eechga,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eechga/reflections_on_1_year_of_early_retirement/,1577059331.0,"It has been over a year now since I quit my job. It feels like an eternity ago.

At first it was very difficult emotionally. Work provided me structure and purpose. It took me a few months to figure out what my new path in life will be.

Socially it has been difficult too. Few people my age have the freedom that I do. Most people are bogged down with commitments and responsibilities. I found it hard to integrate into society because I felt so different.

A common first reaction of telling people I'm retired is that they actually think I'm on a sabbatical. Others think I'm lying. Some think I got lucky or am a lot richer than I am.

I've learned to navigate the social aspects better. What has helped is finding projects of my own to work on. I no longer tell people I'm retired. When people ask I will usually say I'm financially independent, then talk about the projects I am working on.

One of the most difficult decisions I've been facing is where to live. The only thing that tied me to my former city was my job. With that gone I have no more ties to a single location. Having the freedom to live anywhere in the world has resulted in decision fatigue.

Ultimately I don't think I want to live in any one place. I want to establish homes in multiple locations. I want to continue traveling the world. It is simply too difficult of a decision to make of where to live when I haven't been everywhere yet.

I thought when I retired I would not be worried about money. But that ambition inside of me never died. I always want more. I get a thrill from making money.

There was a brief moment when I considered going back into the workforce (a.k.a. getting a job). I thought it might be nice to have structure, to be told what to do, to be part of something bigger. Ultimately that moment did not last long (it actually died when I was interviewed and I remembered what bullshit corporate culture is). I forfeited my work rights, so getting a job there would incredibly difficult if I ever did want to do so. I can't see myself wanting to be employed again.

I've set out new endeavors where I can continue to work on increasingly growing projects. It keeps me intellectually stimulated. It provides structure and purpose. Frankly, it just gives me something to do, a reason to wake up.

Boredom is one thing I've suffered from a lot over the past year. Having so much time to fill up has actually been challenging. Often I simply just don't know what to do with my time. I feel that I waste a lot of time because I can afford to.

I don't think not having a job has made me any happier. It's just a different state of existence now. I feel a lot more free. I don't give in to anyone. This is my new normal.",financialindependence
917,How are you teaching your kids to have a good understanding of money/savings/financial awareness?,,826,bh7nyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bh7nyl/how_are_you_teaching_your_kids_to_have_a_good/,1556192943.0,"Not strictly FIRE related maybe, but I figure this board is full of people who actively consider their finances on a regular basis and I want to bring up my kids to be aware of financial planning whilst they are young and teach them it's an important thing to bear in mind. Hopefully that way when they become adults money won't be a huge mystery to them that they have to learn to navigate. 

So about us - family where I have FIREd, my husband is able to RE but chooses to keep working as he enjoys it. Kids are 9 and 5. Financially we are now very comfortable and have zero money worries. 

Both kids have healthy savings accounts that we pay into monthly to cover the cost of university/first house deposit/early adult life. Kids don't really know about these accounts. 

Recently my 9 year old asked if she could get pocket money (as a lot of her friends get it) so we now give them both a set amount of money every week. We thought about it and decided we would give them more pocket money than their peers but on the understanding that we would no longer buy them toys/slime/trinkets - if they want a Lego set they have to buy it themselves. 

We also opened up kids bank accounts for them, that some of their pocket money has to go into every week and they get sent paper bank statements once a month where they can track their balance and (much to my daughter's delight) learn about interest paid on savings. 

Our rules are that they have to spend some, they have to save some and they have to give some away (I think charitable giving is a good habit to learn, plus I want them to be slightly aware that not everyone is necessarily as fortunate or privileged as they are.) 

My daughter is fascinated by watching her savings grow, my son is maybe a bit too young to understand money and has the impulse control of a 5 year old - although he's learning that if he saves some of his money regularly it means that he can buy new Transformers every couple of weeks.

918,Gave 2-week notice today.,,829,6nylnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6nylnr/gave_2week_notice_today/,1500353288.0,"Mid-40's, single no kids. SWR 2.5 - 3.25% (I will report back on actual number in a year).


After 22 years in IT, I'm excited beyond belief to leave this rat race. I don't think I will miss it a single bit.

I took my usual evening walk today. Usually for 95% of this walk I contemplate, analyze, or strategize about stuff at work. Today, I mostly thought about what I would do in the coming weeks; and made plans for a month-long camping trip to some of my favorite national parks. What a liberating feeling.

My tentative plans are:

1) A 6-month winding-down period. I'd like to focus on health and fitness, reduce clutter in the house and trend towards r/minimalism, and spend more time with my hobby.

2) Alternate US and global travel thereafter. Potentially building a side business with my hobby.

I find it inspiring reading progress reports of some of the other FI/RE'ers here. I will try to report back periodically as well, with the hope that it could be helpful to others.

For now, looking back as I'm about to embark on this new journey, if I could have told my younger self one thing, it would have been to learn the concepts of r/financialindependence early on. See up until about 35 I had no substantial savings and was just living it up. Don't get me wrong it was fun and I enjoyed it. But I could have shortened my time to FI/RE by several years had I been more disciplined.

On the plus side, I was fortunate enough to be in a field with relatively high demand, combined that with working hard, my income growth eventually outpaced spending by a large margin.

So TL;DR: maximize income; minimize expenses.

919,29/F - $250k NW - Quarter of the way there and a story of how I got there,,829,96afxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/96afxt/29f_250k_nw_quarter_of_the_way_there_and_a_story/,1533932200.0,"Like many people here, discovering this subreddit changed my life. I am an immigrant and I immigrated here when I was a teen with my parents and sister. We lived in a LCOL area and my parents' combined income never exceeded $45k. However, they still managed to buy a house, everyone had a car, and we lived pretty comfortably. However, there was no room for savings. We come from a country where saving money is less realistic than seeing a unicorn, so income in always equaled spending. Fast forward to 2010 at the height of the recession and both of my parents lost their jobs (I was in college at the time). The difficult times we went through during that time as well as discovering this subreddit right after graduating from college would define how I look at money and would lead me to where I am today.

Sometime early in life I realized that academic success was my way out of the poverty cycle. My parents were incredibly supportive and gave me every opportunity to succeed. In high school I worked 35-45 hrs/week while also managing to graduate as valedictorian. I got into a top 3 school in the country and graduated in 2012 with a degree in engineering. 

I got my first job starting at $55k/year in NYC. After taxes, health insurance, etc. my take home pay was around $2800. My rent was $1100, transit was $150, and food in NYC is expensive. I quickly realized that although I was making more money at 23 than both my parents combined had ever made, without some cutbacks I would live paycheck to paycheck and never get anywhere. Around this time I also discovered /r/PF and everything changed. 

I am not a spender by nature and I am not into fancy clothes, shoes, purses, electronics, etc. I like good food, I like going out, and I like live music and sports. So I spend money on these things. I don't really have a budget and I don't know my savings rate. I just know that whenever I buy something, I make sure I really need it and I try to get the best deal possible. I try not to spend money on frivolous things (lunch, coffee, $15 cocktails, expensive purses and clothes). I save a lot of money on rent by underspending - yes it's possible even in NYC. I live with my boyfriend and even though our combined income would have allowed us to move into a $3000 apartment at the time, we found one for $1700 just outside of NYC and lived there for 5 years, even though our incomes had almost doubled in that time span. By the time we moved out, my share of the rent was only 12% of my salary ($880 on a $94k/yr salary). My salary kept increasing from year to year, while I tried to keep my expenses steady (I did suffer from some lifestyle inflation, but not nearly enough to match the increases in my income).

My salaries went from:

2012 - $55k

2013 - $58k

2014 - $62k

2015 - $66k

2016 - $74k

2017 - $86k

2018 - $94k

Savings:

* I have been maxing out my 401k for the last 3 years. Before that I had never put aside less than $10k/year. I get a 10% match from my employer which has added anywhere from $5k to $10k year.
* I save all my profit shares. They go straight into my Vanguard or my IRA
* I max out my Roth IRA every year
* I get paid once a month so whatever is left over in my bank account at the end of the month goes straight to savings. That means it was extra money that I didn't need. Over the years this amount has changed drastically. Some months it would be $300-400. Recently, as my salary has gone up, this amount could be $3k. If, for example, it's February and it's frigid and we don't do much socializing, my expenses come down to rent, groceries, take our a few times a months, and that's it. Sometimes this is less than $1600/month, which means that the rest of my salary is extra. This goes straight to Vanguard. 

My [Net Worth Chart](https://imgur.com/a/KYqvQJi). That one big jump is when I linked my 401k to Mint.

[My asset allocation](https://imgur.com/Z36E4IE)

Not shown are the almost $30k I've paid off on my parents' apartment. This apartment is in my name due to their credit issues, and will be mine to keep when they are gone. However, they pay it off. I know rule #1 on this sub is to not do this for family, but my parents are literally the only reason why I am where I am and I owe everything to them. I have paid off $30k and there is $30k left on the mortgage. I plan on paying it off and ""gifting"" it to them when I'm done, thus liberating them from the mortgage. I've thrown any excess money there (so any bonuses, any money left over at the end of the month) has gone there which is why my Vanguard and is low compared to 401k. They don't know I'm doing this for them and would/will kill me when they found out, but I can't wait to surprise them :) Technically the apartment is in my name so it's part of my net worth but it won't be mine to sell for hopefully a very long time, and I hope to be FIRE long before that, so I don't count it as part of my FIRE goals. My parents also signed over our house in my home country to me and that's worth around $120k. However, it's also excluded because I would never sell it due to sentimental value. 

I am 28, will be 29 in a couple of months. My goal was $300k by the time I'm 30 and I think it's doable. Overall, I know I'm extremely lucky - lucky to have a supportive family to allow me to build a career that pays me very well that allows me to have a high savings rate. My goal is to become a millionaire by the time I'm 35. I don't know how realistic this is but I don't plan on changing anything in the meantime. I will continue to go to concerts, to sporting events, I will continue to eat out a couple of times a week, I will continue traveling a couple of times a year, and I will continue not spending money on stupid stuff. My salary will continue to grow while my spending will remain steady. My net worth will continue to climb at a steady pace, and I look forward to just watching that number grow. I'm not tied to any deadlines or any expectations. I just want to take advantage of the fortunate situation I'm in and I want to give myself the flexibility that has alluded a lot of people. 

Feel free to ask me any questions :) I just wanted to share my story since I never dreamt that I would have this much money in my life and it's an incredible feeling knowing that not only am I financially stable, but I am able to help out the people that helped me get to that point.

920,FIREd on Friday,,829,barsd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/barsd2/fired_on_friday/,1554716552.0,"I have retired on Friday.  My wife has been retired for about three years.  

This post is a bit about our path, and a bit about our concerns.  

We came to the US in 1990-1991; I became a grad student here.  I got an RA, and did not have to pay tuition; they even paid me a small stipend ($1100/mo in a VHCOL area).  After graduation, I had a temp position for a year, then started to work for various hi-tech companies in a HCOL area.  My wife worked most of the time (except for the last three years and after birth of our second child).  Both kids are out of college now.  They went to a state school, and we have paid for their education.  

Coming from a humble background, my wife knows how to save money.  We are not materialistic, and do not care about designer clothes or nice cars.  The only really expensive purchase was our house, which we bought exactly at the peak.  It has not reached the original price, but we like it and are not planning to move.  We were moderately lucky with our investments, but did not have spectacular returns.  I came to US in 1990 with 30 dollars, my wife and daughter came in 1991 on money that I have borrowed.  Given what we have now, we fared well.  

Now I am pivoting to reading, writing and teaching math.  I observed the state of math education in US when my kids went to school, and I think there is a lot to be desired here.  I am talking to a private school in the area about teaching an elective class there.  (Public schools require a license.)

In addition to 401k plans and IRAs we have some rental real estate.  Altogether, real estate is about 2/3rds of our NW.  We should be fine. Still, I am not very optimistic about SWR.  Here comes a bit about our concerns, as promised.  

I am afraid that the common 4% may be too good to be true.  Having a quantitative background, I've got various considerations to support this concern.  I will not bore readers with my own rambling, but will quote a book   “The Battle for Investment Survival” by G. Loeb, who in turn quotes another guy.   Here is what Loeb writes:

“Capital compounded at 6% doubles itself in money value in only twelve years, and at 5% in little more than fourteen years. The fantastic results of this process were illustrated by the late Frank A. Vanderlip in a *Saturday Evening Post* story of January, 1933. He pointed out that if the rich Medici family in Italy just six hundred years ago has set aside at 5% compound interest an investment fund equal to $100,000, its 1933 value would be $517,100,000,000,000,000 (five hundred and seventeen quadrillions). The original sum could have been represented by a globe of gold about nine inches in diameter, and the final figure would be 46 million times the existing monetary gold stock of the world.”  The author proceeds to write that “There are many … threats, such as taxation, regimentation (including rationing), war, new inventions, political changes, and revolutions”."" 

This argument states that the recent 7-10% returns of stock market indices may not be sustainable, universal or both.  Both the productivity growth and the population growth have slowed down.  It is hard to imagine that real returns of the stock market (after inflation) will beat these two variables on a continuing basis.  

We have selected a conservative approach and can use a withdrawal rate, which is lower than 4%.  Being 58 also helps :-)

921,How do I forget about FIRE?,,820,eof94k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eof94k/how_do_i_forget_about_fire/,1578971135.0,"This time last year, I didn’t even know about the FIRE movement. I was someone who naturally lived below their means and saved what was left over. 

Then, I stumbled upon the FI subreddit(s). I started paying more attention to how my assets were balanced and made sure I was properly using tax advantage accounts. I am very happy to have discovered and utilized this valuable information.

I always thought I could retire early, or at least very comfortably. But now, I have a number and a spreadsheet that tracks it. I can’t stop thinking about when I can retire and how I am going to get there. I keep playing with spreadsheet, toying with: What if I save more now? What if I spend less in retirement? Could I afford to retire even earlier? I keep reading debates about investment strategy and safe withdrawal rates. It’s consuming me.

I was attracted to the idea of financial independence because I didn’t want money to be a concern in my day to day life. But now I am thinking about it more than I ever have. 

I am certain I have the knowledge and discipline not to react to short-term market fluctuations. So, why do I insist on checking the DJIA every day? Why do I keep checking my net-worth on Mint? 

How do I get back to the mode of simply spending less than I make, letting my automatic investments do their thing and not obsessing over my account balances?",financialindependence
922,Some psychological observations from someone who just took a 6 week sabbatical,,820,7vwp7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7vwp7k/some_psychological_observations_from_someone_who/,1518016188.0,"Background: Quit my job of almost 5 years back in December. Plan was to take some time for myself before lining up another gig. Starting the new job next week.

Financial status: Income from my small business makes just enough to cover my expenses. Have a couple hundred grand invested across retirement and brokerage. Own (with mortgage) primary residence & one rental property. Unmarried with no kids, but in a serious relationship and we live together.

A lot of the things I've experienced during these 6 weeks away from the working world have been eye opening, while also being things people have totally said to me on this sub before. Nevertheless, now that I've lived them they're obviously resonating with me very strongly.

***Workaholics are workaholics***. I've always been a Type A personality, and despite bountiful dissatisfaction with the job that I left, I have been very motivated in terms of my FI/RE and general life goals, and untiring in terms of pursuing any opportunities that come my way. Sometimes it's stressful to be this way.

To the surprise of no one, taking 6 weeks off from committed work made this worse if anything. By the time about 2 weeks had passed I found myself having accepted two new freelance consulting projects, telling myself that they were great opportunities to further my skillset and earn some extra money.

In other words, despite seeing from a distance the mental health benefit of dialing down my relentless pursuit of career and financial success, when push came to shove I was pretty quick to give up on that.

If I RE someday I see it being a real challenge for me to find purpose. I see myself as someone who will struggle with ""one more year"" syndrome and moving goalposts because I have so deeply trained myself to seek these things.

***Social interaction provided by work*** I've seen a lot of people on this sub warn about feeling lonely or understimulated socially after leaving the workplace. This wasn't my experience at all. I think even after 6 weeks I haven't fully bounced back from the extremely socially drained feeling that my old job left me with. I definitely don't feel ready to start forcibly interacting all day again with people I didn't choose.

I really enjoyed going to the grocery store and other errands at weird hours when it was much quieter. I didn't notice it taking less time but it felt a lot less overwhelming to me.

When I envisioned my sabbatical I thought I'd feel super eager to do things with my friends so i overcommitted in advance to all sorts of things, thinking I'd finally feel great about attending them. But when the time came I felt similarly socially wary about doing them as I did when I had a full-time job. I'm not sure if this is related to job stress that I'm still getting over or introversion that I didn't previously observe in myself.

UPDATE: This started to turn after my second, longer sabbatical. After a ""detox"" period of a couple of months I started to become extremely lonely and miss the social interaction of the office.

***Relationship hurdles*** My relationship was canonical throughout this time period. Maybe it would be different if both partners were on a sabbatical at the same time. There were still the same relationship challenges as always that cropped up. I wasn't magically okay with things that previously bothered me. I didn't magically find it easier to make time for solving difficult relationship problems. Those are just always hard.

I had these visions of doing more nice things for my partner doing this time but this never materialized. I always managed to become busy with other things. Lesson learned there, things never magically prioritize themselves, you have to put in the work to prioritize them.

***Money stress*** I hardly thought about money at all and this was probably one of the best parts of the break. I did some serious planning in advance to ensure I had the correct size cushion of cash. My business has a separate bank account and I made a point of not drawing from it, so I really was living off of savings. I went about my life, hardly thought about what I was spending, logged into Personal Capital maybe once, and didn't bat an eye about the stock market drama the other day.

I hope if I RE that I will feel similarly confident in my own planning that I can achieve some level of cognitive dissonance about declining money :)

***Tl;dr / summary*** When reflecting across all of these points and the rest of my time away from work, there is a clear pattern to me.

As we go through our lives we're wiring ourselves a certain way, and nothing about changing our job situation will magically change our wiring. It won't make us better or different or happier people. I was the same person as always and this was both comforting and scary, but eye-opening most of all.

If I want to be kinder, more compassionate, less stressed, more mentally healthy, or have better social skills, then I simply have to take direct initiative about these things; waiting for a change in external circumstances is strictly a waste of time in that regard.

923,On the Road to Achieving FI while making 66K,,818,hcuh9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hcuh9e/on_the_road_to_achieving_fi_while_making_66k/,1592689790.0,"Hello, all! 

I shared a post yesterday where I talked about hitting a milestone of maxing out 403B and getting my rental property self-sustaining all while making 65-66K per year and coming from an underprivileged background. 

I received a lot of DMs asking for specific details & insight so I thought I would share it in a post. (The mods removed the original post because it was a milestone better suited for a milestone thread). 

&#x200B;

Background:

I’m currently a 29F. I was born in India & moved to the US with my family when I was 5. My dad immigrated on a work-visa in the late 80s & worked in a convenience store, as a dishwasher, and a check-out clerk to provide for us. He & my mom got a loan to buy a small motel in rural OK when I was 6. They were making enough to pay bills, but not really saving. We then moved to Texas where they bought a bigger property (again with a huge loan this time from the SBA). They were able to save a little this time, but that was wiped out when the Great Recession hit. I graduated HS in 2008 & really had no idea how I would make it through college. My school was a rural school and we didn't have a guidance counselor. Most of the teachers expected us to not go to college. Somehow, using the internet, I figured it out and went to a state university. I worked during college (sometimes as many as 3 jobs) and graduated without loans. 

&#x200B;

Income & Investments:

After I graduated, I began working in education. I love the field & the impact education can have on lives. I love the field, but it doesn’t pay well. I’ve been working for 8 years, but only started to make over 60K in the last three. I have worked in many aspects of education including K-12, non-profits, and now higher ed. Some of the orgs had 403bs and matching, but not all. My current org gives us 10% (5% base, 5% match). 

I basically taught myself about personal finance using the pf subreddit. My family didn’t really discuss personal finance as my parents were just focused on keeping their business running so I was starting at level zero. I didn’t know much from 2012-2014 expect that I wanted to eventually get an MBA so I was just saving cash for that. 

I just lived way below my means in a tiny studio and was focused on saving as much as cash as I could. I also got my first credit card in 2015- a BofA travel rewards card! Before, I used to pay for everything with a debit card lol. 

In 2015, I started a Roth IRA and have maxed it out every year. All in low-cost index funds using the Bogle method. 

In 2016, I started my MBA at another state school. I went part-time while working full-time so it took 3 years. It cost about 30K in all, but I was able to pay in cash installments every semester. 

In 2017, I became the Executive Director of a local non-profit and my pay was $62K, but it included no retirement or health insurance. I paid for health insurance out of pocket, maxed out my Roth IRA and put a lot of other cash into a taxable brokerage account still investing in low-cost index funds. 

I also bought a house at this time. I’d never lived in a house before! I put 5% down even thought I could have put more & I’m glad I did.  I also put into my closing contract for the seller to pay 5K of the closing costs and they did! So, my cash to close was something like 3K. Crazy! 

At that time, 62K seemed like a jackpot for me! My take-home pay was around 4K and that just seemed like a LOT of money (still does tbh). I just saved most of it. 

In 2019, I moved across the country to begin working at a university. My salary is now 66K. The org gives us 10% in a 403b as well as really good health insurance. The 403b is invested in low-cost Vangaurd index funds as well. 

One of my goals this year was to max out my 403B (19,500). I wanted to first hit 6 months’ worth of expenses in my Efund and at least 15K in my house fund so I continued to stock away money. I put my tax refunds, stimulus, any extra cash into these accounts. I also stuck by a budget (but I definitely treat myself!). I had about 7K in my home fund in February and I swear once I became laser focused on growing this, different income streams opened up. I started a small side-hustle mentoring & coaching high school student and then I started an online conference business during the pandemic whilst working from home. 

I also finally increased my contributions enough to max out my 403b!

I was renting out my house as an Airbnb but decided to make the shift to long-term lease in April. My Airbnb manager was great, and she & a few other local contacts did some on the ground stuff for me, while I worked on marketing the property. I was initially going to go with a property manager but was barely going to break even with their 10% fees. So, I decided to DIY (and found a great online resource to help manage things ([Avail.co](https://Avail.co))). 

I just found some renters last week who signed the lease, paid their deposit & first month’s rent & move in soon! I had a very thorough vetting process which is why my place took a little longer to rent, but it was 100% worth it. I did all the research myself using website like [Avail.co](https://Avail.co) & Bigger Pockets. 

I also worked with a great tax accountant to got me the full benefit of active loss clause for small-time landlords (folks who make under a 100K can get a 25K loss benefit to their W-2 income). Since, my rental income was a net loss esp including depreciation, I was able to have my MAGI lowered by the amount of my loss. That helped at tax time. 

&#x200B;

Keeping my expenses low has been mostly easy. I’m a pretty relaxed person. All of my hobbies are free. Literally, my favorite things to do are go on walks with my dogs and read books in my hammock. I enjoy travelling too, but obviously that’s on a pause right now. 

&#x200B;

Future Goals:

My future goals are 

1)	Continue maxing out my 403B

2)	Move into a director level role at my org or a similar org (ideally making 100K+ and ideally being remote)

3)	Buy rental property in cash (maybe—I want to see how like being a landlord!)

4)	Continue really liking my work (very important to me)

5)	Make an impact for others (I’d like to financially support girls’ education)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyways, I hope this answers some specific questions people had! I’m happy to share 

&#x200B;

TLDR:

I have never made more than 66K and I’m sharing my journey on how I was able to max out my 403B, rent out a property and more.",financialindependence

I keep hearing this and reading this over and over.  It is part of the media narrative.   They must have a financial reason to keep saying this because it may or may not be true.

If you are talking about people living longer from birth, that is false.  More young people are dying young because of drug abuse and alcohol.  Lots of overweight people who live a terribly unhealthy lifestyle dropping like flies in my hometown.

(Maybe a 60-year-old today might live a few years longer than someone who it 60 twenty years ago, but it is likely just a year or two, which would not have that much impact of their success using a 4% rule.)

925,"Pros, Cons and Lessons of Being a “Trust Fund Kid”",,827,chnypg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/chnypg/pros_cons_and_lessons_of_being_a_trust_fund_kid/,1564062940.0,"Hey everyone,
 
This is my first post from mobile so I apologize if the formatting is terrible. 

I’ve been following this sub for about a year now and I’ve seen some general negative sentiments regarding people who have an inheritance when they are young. Me being one of these people, I thought I would share my experience to give everyone a more balanced look at how this has affected my life. 

Long story short, my grandfather (who I never met) made a ton of money in the insurance industry. This money was passed down to my father after he died. 

This is where the story takes a turn. My parents got divorced, and subsequently a few months later my father died. At 3 years old I was given a trust fund of ~$50000. My mom (who is a saint) reinvested this money for me until I took control of the account at 21 with a balance of ~$200000. This has been life changing money in my college life/early career and one of the reason I found the FIRE community. So, finally, I’ll get to the pros of having this money: 

1. I was able to attend and graduate from a 4 year university completely debt-free. Even though I had plenty of scholarships and financial aid (my moms annual income is not very high), I was still able to cover the remaining 2-4 grand left over every semester with my inheritance. This is currently the only thing I’ve pulled money out of these accounts for. 

2. I have a huge leg up on many of my peers at this stage of my life. Being 23, living in a LCOL area and just starting my career, I can afford to be picky with the career path I want to take. If I wanted to quit my job tomorrow (which I don’t), I know that I would be fine to spend some time training, going back to school or taking some time for myself. 

3. Having money taught me the value of money. I worked jobs in high school and college because my conscious couldn’t even imagine pulling money out of these accounts for “fun” (not to mention $200 paychecks in high school make you feel like a king).

4. This money has given me motivation to aggressively save MY hard earned money. I have just started contributing to my 401k and have about $30000 in a HYSA from my jobs post-college. Having a leg up makes me want to get to FIRE faster!

Now, here are the cons:

1. Having an absent step-father who never really took interest in me made me very insecure as a child, and even up to now. I don’t really have a male role model in my family/friends that I can go to for advice. This has led to some mental health issues that I’m a currently seeking treatment for. 

2. I am not really close to my father’s side of the family. There is no contention or animosity but it almost feels like after a certain point they stopped trying to keep in contact.

3. I have never enjoyed the finer things in life. Sure, I’ve never been poor or had to worry about basic necessities, but I also didn’t get to do things my friends did (travel sports, fancy vacations , etc.) because my mom couldn’t afford it (my mom is great with money and my main inspiration in FIRE and life if you couldn’t tell already). 

4. My moms side of the family are not very well off. I’m concerned in the future I may be asked to support my grandmother financially and I don’t know if this will result in family tension. 

In short, there are many fair and valid criticisms of “trust-fund babies” who have never worked a day in their life. I don’t particularly like them either. I won’t sit here and pretend my life is a tragedy. I’ve been extremely blessed by not only this money but the people surrounding me. I simply wanted to bring attention to the facts that for some people, an inheritance comes with significant trade offs in their non-financial life. Sure, most of the cons I listed are emotional rather than financial, but that’s just as big if not bigger part of your life (who wants to FIRE if they’ll never enjoy it?). It’s very hard to judge someone’s situation by the numbers in their bank account. 

For everyone who has read to the bottom, thank you and feel free to share your own perspective on the matter. I’m interested to hear what other people have to say (famous last words).

EDIT: I realized as I am reading the comments that the title may be misleading. I conflated the terms trust fund and inheritance by accident. This post is speaking about inheritances.",financialindependence

928,My (Delayed) FIRE Journey,,821,jfzqps,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jfzqps/my_delayed_fire_journey/,1603373751.0,"TLDR – Unmotivated kid that barely made it out of high school, joins the military, gets educated, and travels the world as a Corporate cog before retiring comfortably at 54.

 
A lot of the posts here seem to follow a common pattern:  Young person gets a good degree, lands a great high paying job at a tech company, starts saving right away, and retires in their early 30’s .  Absolutely nothing wrong with that – wish I had done it that way. 

 I have been FI for a few years and figure I am about 5 years from RE, so I thought I would share my story for those of us that did not have our act together, early on.

 I barely graduated high school in 1989.  I think I failed 2 classes my senior year solely because I skipped too many days.  With absolutely no interest in school, I got a job doing construction work.  Getting bored with that, I enlisted in the Air Force in 1991 (starting pay $697.20/mo).  A co-worker convinced me to take a college class with him.  What started as 3 semester hours, quickly increased to 15/18 semester hours.  While I would not say it was enjoyable, it did give me something to focus on.

In 1996, I completed my degree in business (from a school I guarantee you have not heard of) and was accepted to Officer Training School.  Along with the 52% bump in pay with becoming an officer, I met my future wife.  Fortunately, she was way better at managing money than I was.  When I got to my next assignment, I started my MBA.

 In 2000, my wife and I welcomed our daughter.  After 10 years, I left the Air Force in 2001 with about $40K (wife/my IRAs) and $10K for a house down payment.

I started off an IT consultant.  My pay was about twice what I made in the military, but the first job did not last long as the company went out of business.  Fortunately, I was able to quickly move to a client, doing the same work - with a raise.

 Over the next 20 years, I continued to work/advance in this field, moving to different companies and getting progressive bumps in pay.  During this time, we kept saving more.  Maxing out IRAs, 401ks, Coverdell, even a Mega Backdoor Roth for a few years.  At the peak, we were probably saving 70% of my income. 

 Most of my jobs required a lot of international travel, so I was able to travel the world in business/first class, on the company’s dime.  While I have been to around 50 countries on 6 continents, there were probably 15-20 countries that I traveled to a bit more frequently.  My wife and daughter were able to accompany me on several of these trips.  For personal trips, I had lots of points/miles.  I tease my wife and daughter that they are spoiled because the first time they had to fly economy for an international trip was in 2018.

 After moving on from my last job (completing my 2nd Master’s degree, while I was there), I came to the realization that I really did not like working anymore.  I was always one of those guys that thought I would work forever.  Then that number dropped to 67, then 65, then 60.  Now I have got 54 as my number (~5 years away).

 I have $2.6M in retirement savings, a rental house that is paid off, and my daughter has 3 semesters of college left.  We just used up her college savings, so will pay off the remainder as the bills come in.  Our only debt is our current residence and we just got that refinanced to 2.75%.

 My goal is to get to $4M in retirement savings before retiring.  Using conservative numbers, along with our current savings approach, this is doable.  Our rental property will get sold off to purchase our retirement home, wherever that might be.  My wife and I are starting to research areas.

 Compared to most people, I am in a pretty good place financially.  Especially when you consider how I started off and that I am missing 10 years of work-related retirement savings/matching.  I put this story out there to demonstrate to others that “don’t think it’s possible” or will “never be able to do what these other people have done.”  It will not be easy, and it will take a lot of effort or commitment on your part, but it is possible.

 
Some general thoughts/recommendations from my experience:

-Get a degree!  Do not overpay for it and make sure you can get a job with it.

-Max out your tax advantaged accounts.  You will never get to where you want to be without doing this.  It is going to be painful, but once you adjust, you will not miss it.

-Being a landlord is OK, but it is nowhere near as simple or handsfree as people make it out to be.  I would have been much better off (with a lot less hassle) if my money sat in the market.

-If you are saving money for your kids to go to college – save MORE.

-The Air Force is a perfectly good way to get started.  However, you will need to maintain focus.  Get into a career field with a marketable skill and go to school.  It is a lot more fun to drink with your buddies than it is to go to classes at night.

It was only recently that I found this sub and realized that we are not alone in the thought that the main thing we want out of life is financial freedom.  Stories in this sub have helped to keep me motivated.  I hope that I can contribute in the same way.  

**Brief Background**

My wife's father once described us as the most successful people in our families.  In like, forever.  I am a CPA and she is a teacher.  My salary has ranged from low 40s in ~2009 to now low 80s.  My wife's has ranged from low 40s since ~2011 to now mid 50s.  We are both in our very early 30s and our son is almost 3.  We have had no inheritances.  We have had no monetary gifts.  Our growth is largely organic and opportunistic.  Our families were challenging at best, being largely broken and not fiscally sound.  Fights over money, mounting debt by our parents, poor houses growing up, etc.   We've been hardened to life a little, having been exposed to murders, abusive step parents, alcoholism and drugs, suicides, and even homelessness.  We have had some important people that motivated us along the way, such as teachers, ROTC instructors, bosses, and friends.  I moved in with my now wife and her parents at the age of 17, and we both moved out when I was 19.  We got married after a decade of being together.  Around that time was when I really started tracking our finances.  

I think our personal experiences shaped us into being fairly fiscally-minded people.  In college, I was the guy that turned my vehicle AC on over a certain speed and rolled the windows down below that speed because I had read that it saved gas.  I have always been a coupon-friendly guy.  My wife loves to cook, so we save a lot on not going out all the time.  She appreciates frugality slightly less than I do, but is not a ""material girl"".  We generally live well below our needs on purpose.  

**Education**

My wife and I are both products of public education and a public university.  Thankfully, we were very fortunate to leave college without any debt.  In our state, there is a program for a state-funded tuition scholarship when you achieve a certain GPA in high school and a certain standardized test score.  My wife and I both got that.  I had additional scholarships that allowed me to literally pocket money while in college and pay for my master's, and my wife had some scholarships as well that only required she pay a small amount every year.  I finished with perfect marks, and my wife damn near did as well.  

**Portfolio**

We started saving before 2013, but that was when I really started tracking my balance sheet.  I don't really track an income statement on paper, but I have everything in mint and run reports.  I keep us in check during the year, but as long as our life-creep doesn't come on too strong, and our balances increase at the rate we hoped, I may not ever put one together.  

Our assets (Major PPE) are primarily our house (I kept the value at cost), our cars (depreciating annually), and my wife's wedding bands.  Other investments include a post-tax account that I setup back in 2007 (yeah, I wasnt the best financial advisor to myself then..) and a real estate LLC that a friend and I are testing out starting in 2017.  

Debt is primarily the house and some accrued medical and small credit card balances.  I never pay credit card interest, but I use them exclusively for the points (see below).  We refinanced our house to a 15 year mortgage in 2012 at ~2.5%.  It just dropped below 100K in January 2018.   

Retirement investments are our 401ks.  I get a 3% match and contribute 15% (10 traditional, 5 roth).  My wife gets a 5% match and contributes 10% (all traditional).  She also maxes out a dependent care FSA since we are on a PPO.  Of course, the market has helped us achieve this current milestone.

**Reducing Overhead**

One of my routines is constantly making sure that the bills are as low as needed.  Cordcutting has helped for a lot of people, but I have been using a HD homerun prime for years to keep my cable bill down.  We installed spray foam and energy efficient appliances/thermostat in the house to keep electricity down.  We drive smaller and cheaper cars to keep our gas bill and insurance bill down.  I shop our insurance every 6 months to make sure I am getting the best rates.  We refinanced our house to save on interest.  

**My Favorite Love/Hate Investment**

Interest bearing checking accounts.  These have been very good to me, but my biggest ""hindsight is 20/20"" situation is that I do wish I would have put them into a growth fund over the past few years.  But alas, I did not.  Our plan all along has been to save up enough cash on hand to pay off our next house.  Then we would invest those funds in something conservative to offset the interest.  So I started opening up various interest checking accounts across the country and in my state.  My lowest earns 3% and my highest earns 5%, with a weighted average of around 3.9-4.0%.  I use a combination of automatic ACH, mint for login, and spend an hour every month buying Amazon gift cards on the debit cards.  I have 8 accounts open now that require monthly ""work"" and around 16 that are passive.  

**My Favorite Hobbies**

One suggestion I could give is that if you like any hobby that MAKES money, focus on it.  I like to do some resale on the side, and that does make me a little money, but nothing significant.   Enough to pay for some of my toys with what I scour from slickdeals and dansdeals personally.  

But I am also a credit card churner.  There is something about staying in an all-inclusive for free by 'gaming' the credit card system makes it that much nicer to enjoy!  I do not track my points in my net worth, but I am sitting on north of 2M points in total.  This is a great hobby and really fits with the FI mentality if you are organized and comfortable with playing games with your credit (my wife and I are both north of 800, so the risk is low).

**Next Goals**

One Million Net Worth by 35.  Really, I always told myself that I wanted to be a millionaire by 30, but I had to modify that goal a bit!  Shoot for the moon, right?  Worst case, you land among the stars.

Thanks for the support!,,815,d9l3x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/d9l3x0/update_approved_for_disability_thanks_for_the/,1569511397.0,"A little more than 2 years ago, I made a post about health issues forcing me to FIRE sooner than I planned ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6brwvr/stereotypical_path_to_fire_then_unusual_fire/)). 

I had been planning on a normal-to-fat FIRE since I was in college. Then I started having health issues that were eventually diagnosed as Ehlers Danlos (hypermobile). Basically, I started getting more frequent and persistent joint pain that reduced how much I could work and forced me to give up all my previous hobbies. I saw the writing on the wall, and started preparing for a lean FIRE. When I finally couldn't work anymore, I was denied disability. I was mentally and physically worn down at that point, and I didn't have it in me to continue to pursue a disability claim.

Well, people responded to my post and strongly encouraged me to continue pursuing my disability claim (as did friends and family). So I got help from a lawyer who would carry the load for me, and 2 years later I'm happy to say that I was finally approved! So thank you for all your encouragement!

I don't plan to make any significant changes to my spending or lifestyle. The main benefit for me is healthcare. Due to money constraints I've been putting off a lot of medical stuff. Now I'll have access to good coverage at a reasonable price, so I'll finally get see doctors for issues that I've been putting off.

I briefly explained fire and how with some hard work and smart investment moves I could retire at 45 or sooner. I explained the concept of working and saving hard in my 20s and 30s should allow me to retire early etc. Mom thought it was a great idea but had tears in her eyes saying, ""I'm so proud of you, but here I am at 60, still trying to figure it out.""     :(

That made me so sad and now I'm feeling so guilty. By sharing the concept of fire, by no means did I want someone else to feel bad. I went on to profess my sincere pride in her and her successes in life as well. She was a single mother of four, worked hard, went through hardships and doesn't really have much of a retirement but is living a good life now partly because of a partner she met recently.

Has this sort of guilt ever happened to anyone else? How did you handle it?  I don't really talk about finances with anyone, especially fire but it seemed like an okay time to mention it. I didn't get into specifics but I feel so bad. My heart sunk.

Insurance is supposed to prevent this, but sometimes they don't pay.  Insurance premiums for a family will cost $10k-20k / year unless you have a good employer sponsored plan.

933,I looked around at my family on Christmas and remembered exactly why I want to FIRE.,,814,a9qm9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a9qm9q/i_looked_around_at_my_family_on_christmas_and/,1545846561.0,"Long post ahead. TL;DR: I am watching my older family members age, and it gives me motivation to retire before I am where they are.

A little background, I'm 25 and newly getting into FIRE, currently at 15% SR (plus 6% 401k match) and aggressively paying off my 25k in student loans and 5k left in car loan. Making 60k/yr with lots of growth opportunity. I haven't set a hard deadline for when I want to FIRE (honestly just too many variables right now) but hopefully by 50 at the latest. I could be doing better but I am very new and need time to get finances in order.

Anyway, yesterday I was in a room with a huge chunk of my extended family--siblings, cousins, parents, aunts and uncles, grandparents and more. Specifically, my father and grandfathers got me thinking a lot. 

My grandfather (mom's dad) is a retired Marine, who, for a very long time, was in peak physical condition; an absolute killing machine. He exercised more than most, well into his 60s. He's in his early 70s now and only actually retired less than 10 years ago. Due to a number of medical issues since then, he has become very inactive lately and is physically declining. Yesterday I saw him, among other things, struggle to get up off a couch without help.

My dad's father is in his late 70s, and though I talk to him some, he lives in WA and my Dad talks to him more than I do. Within the last 5 years, he has declined mentally to the point that it is difficult and confusing to have real conversations with him most of the time. Yesterday I heard my dad come back in the room after calling him on Christmas (i would have talked to him as well but i didn't realize he was on the phone with him) and tell us more of the same is going on. He also retired around 65, so he's gotten less than 15 years of coherent retirement.

My dad is 57. He was a finance exec, so I know he has always made and saved good money, but I don't know when he'll be able to retire. He got remarried 12 years ago and proceeded to have 4 more kids, the youngest of which is 3. He won't be out of the house until my dad is minimum 72, and that doesn't count college. On top of that, my dad lost his job this year when his company sold to a larger company. I believe it came with a decent severance package, because he decided to take the rest of this year off work, and his early retirement has been inspiring to say the least. He and my mom and the kids have travelled all over, my dad is in the best shape of his life (way better shape than I am, even; he looks like he's about 40, it's unreal), and he's been able to stay at home when they're not traveling and actually enjoy everyone's company. In my 25 years, I've never seen my dad so happy. He even told me that he's been able to cut his reflux medicine in half and go back to eating anything he wants. That's how much his stress level dropped. Sadly, he is still aging. His hearing is going and he has back pains at times. He almost fell walking over a pile of wrapping paper yesterday and a 57 year old falling is not like a 10 or even a 25 year old falling. Could have been a major blow. And he will need to go back to work soon. Depending on what he decides to do, at least some of the stress will come back, and he probably has at least 10 years of work ahead of him if I had to guess.

So I guess my point is, it's important to cherish the time we get with our families and friends and do what we can to stay healthy as long as possible. But at the end of the day, we will age no matter what, and the earlier we can become able to spend time doing what we want instead of working, the better off we are. In fact, if leaving work removes so much stress as to increase our health, we are likely gaining time on the front *and* the back end.

So happy FIREing, Merry (belated) Christmas, and in the words of my 10 y/o sister yesterday, Happy Boxing Day to all, and to all a good Boxing Night!",financialindependence

**""Okay cut the shit, what is 'Average'?""**

Grabbed ""Average"" from this [Source (dqydj)](https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-individual-income-percentiles/) which shows

*Median (pre-tax) income* of \~$43,000 (50th percentile) and

*Average (pre-tax) income* of \~$62,000 (\~65.5th percentile),

which is just above my average pre-tax job income over the years shown.

**Lifestyle/Expenses**

I am a ""low maintenance person"", so I have a fairly cheap ($750/mo) room rented with housemates (edit: After 6 years, I am finally starting to getting sick of this. Time for an upgrade soon...). No car, bike to work, bus if I'm going somewhere I don't want to bike. Gracious friends help for rides if I'm going somewhere I can't bus or bike to (and then I treat them to lunch, if they'll let me).

Food cost \~$380/mo. I do most of my cooking/bring lunch to work, but don't consciously try to penny pinch at the grocery store. I get the good ice-cream. Food is expensive where I live.

The rest of the expenses are small, but add up to \~$1,800-1,900/mo. Happy to share more info about expenses etc. if you have any questions.

&#x200B;

**Strategy**

Basically, Index funds buy & hold. Nothing too complicated here.

I mostly follow the FIRE investing meme hivemind.

&#x200B;

**Reflecting/Looking Forward**

I definitely realize the market has been an absolute beast for helping me reach this milestone. I'm not sure I expect it to work quite so hard for me in the future (either way, it doesn't affect my approach to investing/FI).  Currently planning for a conservativeish 3.75% withdrawal rate, and have just reached \~50% of my average expenses, \~25% to my arbitrary FI number, which I'm sure will increase. Current planned FI number allows for just over 2x my current expenses. Slow and steady wins the race.

935,Has anyone considered how to best defend your hard-earned FIRE against “filial support” laws that could leave you responsible for your parents’ medical bills?,,805,k309tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k309tt/has_anyone_considered_how_to_best_defend_your/,1606613504.0,"This was something new to me that I learned of a few years back — https://www.harborlifesettlements.com/4-ways-filial-responsibility-laws-can-affect-you/

I tried posting in a few other subreddits at the time, but never ended up with any meaningful discussion on the topic.

In a nutshell, if your parents ran themselves flat broke because they were irresponsible - and yet you were very responsible and FIRE’d, your state may be able to come after your hard-earned finances too.  Your parents credit card debts may not be able to be transferred to you, but depending on your state their medical costs potentially could.

Has anyone consulted with a lawyer or trust attorney in order to build strategies to protect assets from these types of cases?  I wonder whether certain asset classes are beyond reach - such as retirement accounts, and a home.

I know a lot of people here are working hard to reach FIRE, and have some very smart ideas on how to get their and how to live on a safe withdrawal rate.  But a $200,000 nursing home bill would probably blow a giant crater in most people’s plans ... so I’m curious to know if anyone had devised strategies to protect their financial futures as much as possible?",financialindependence

**[NYT Video](https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000005798480/the-happiest-guy-in-the-world.html)**


**Highlights:**

+ Mario Salcedo spends 350 days/yr over past 20 years on cruise ships equalling over 950 total cruises.

+ Salcedo spends about $65,000/yr sailing on a mix of Caribbean cruises and transatlantic crossings, always booking lower-priced interior cabins to keep budget in check.

+ 700 nights qualify for Royal Caribbean’s highest level. Salcedo has about 6,000. The rewards also include free unlimited internet access, which Salcedo said enables him to do business at sea.

+ “I spend five to six hours per day running the business in my pool deck office,"" Salcedo said. ""Without internet access, free or otherwise, I would not be able to live on a cruise ship.""

+ On a typical day, Salcedo works from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. and then closes shop to take a dip in the pool or spend time with friends — ship-based friends, because he's lost touch with most friends on land.

+ Salcedo, 66, was director of international finance at a multinational corporation in Miami when he quit his job in his mid-40s to fulfill two longtime goals: start his own small business and travel the world.


**Discussion:**


This is an example of a really unique goal for FIRE and also a rare concrete example of someone who is actually living out their FIRE dream and providing the financial numbers. Using the 4% withdrawal rule, one could achieve the same results as Mario retiring with $1,625,000 in investment assets. This would allow one to withdrawal $65k/yr for an all inclusive cruise covering food, housing, and utilities for one year. One could also supplement with an internet business, similar concept to what Mario is doing.


Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

940,Fitness and Finance (Tactics vs. Principles),,801,a7em38,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a7em38/fitness_and_finance_tactics_vs_principles/,1545163225.0,"I'm a semi-frequent poster and a long time reader/subscriber to this sub, and I want to toss in my two cents on a topic that's been jumbling around in my head a bit. 

That topic is the topic of Tactics vs. Principles, and how Fitness is a perfect metaphor for these sorts of questions or dilemmas.

Everyone wants ""tactics"" in both arenas. What is the ""best"" thing to do in every situation. What can ""optimize"" everything. How can we eek out a couple tenths of a percentage point in either our returns (finance) or our body's fitness level. 

In both arenas, a novice or beginner doesn't need any ""tactics"" per say. They need principles to live and die by. 

In fitness, this comes across in a few different ways. Eating at standard meal times and avoiding snacking. Reducing or eliminating liquid calories. Creating your own meals at home and meal prepping. Staying active and getting exercise on most days. 

Simply following these principles is all that *most people* need.

In fitness, if you follow these principles, and you are obese to start, you will find yourself in a much better situation with your health, your energy, your body fat levels, and your overall well being. 

Only THEN should you start to look closely at *tactics* and start asking yourself other questions to get you to that ""next level"".

Questions like:

Exactly how many calories do I need each day?
What kind of macronutrient break down would best suit me?
What types of training programs are more efficient than others?
What types of exercise burn the most calories and keep my metabolism high?
What times of the day should I eat what types of food to maximize my performance, my results, and my energy levels?
Are there any supplementation regimens I should look into?

Etc, etc, etc.

When it comes to *finance*, the beginner needs to look at principles ONLY until they have a solid grasp of the basics. Those principles to live by are simple (with their fitness analogy counterparts in parentheses):  

Increase your income (aka - ""burn off more calories"")
Decrease your spending (aka - ""eat less calories"")
Patiently invest the difference (aka - ""be consistent with your calorie deficit - no ""cheat meals"")
Pay off any recurring debt (aka - ""reverse the years/decades of sedentary neglect)

Only after those *principles* are taken care of should anyone even begin to think about the ""tactics"" that can take you to that next level.

Things like:

Tax loss harvesting
Mega Backdoor Strategies
Sophisticated portfolio diversification
Etc, etc, etc.

And for 99% of people, the *principles* of financial literacy is likely all you need. If you can get to the point where you're maxing your tax advantaged accounts and hold everything there, with patience, you're better than 99.9% of the people out there.

It's the 'Dave Ramsey' approach. The ""tactics"" are iffy and can likely be spruced up, but the principles are sound and are pretty much ""can't lose scenarios"".

For most, this is likely preaching to the choir.

But perhaps a few can find this little analogy useful.

Just wanted to contribute something to a community I find very useful and inspiring. 

Have a Happy Holiday Season. :)

My 2016 resolution was to save & invest half of my income after taxes. Well, I just deposited my last check for the year and I’m pleased to say that I exceeded that expectation. This year I saved and invested 52% of my net income! For me, the hardest part about this journey has been finding the motivation to stay on track. The rules are straightforward, but obeying the rules has been very difficult for me to do without keeping a clear vision. So I'm hoping this post will help people in similar situations see what it looks like and encourage them to keep going.

Don't give up, friends!

Here’s the total breakdown of how I have spent every dollar I’ve earned over the last 6 years. You can see the distinct investment increase in 2016, which corresponds to when I started reading this sub.

Here’s my actual and projected spending into year 2030. My goal is to reach $1 million by 2030 (age 43). Please feel free to pick this apart and ask questions and give recommendations. I couldn’t be happier with the support I’ve received with this community thusfar.

I seem to be the odd one out who wants to buy something small and affordable (100k) for now and diversify into index funds. 

My thinking is if people are justifying going all in on a home because you expect prices to climb whats wrong with a smaller home? If you choose the right location and the smaller home isnt particularly terrible why wont it rise in price the same way? I could always sell the smaller home and move up right? Not to mention you arent sure if you will sell that home as you havent deliberated whether its an investment or a home you will stay in for the long haul. 

I talk about this with people and i get weird looks. 

Did i miss a memo? Am i naive? 

Maybe i should ask you guys

Another year, another 100k, and in the middle of a pandemic to boot -\_-. I’ve kept my previous post mainly intact but have made changes in ***bolded italics. All mentions of currency are in CAD.***

***Side note: I’m definitely at the point where market volatility is very noticeable on my portfolio. Stay the course peeps!***

**About me**

Hi! I’m a ***28F*** CPA living in Toronto, Canada. I wanted to post this to show the non IT people in this sub that there are other careers where it’s possible to increase net worth quickly despite not making 100k right out of school. I’ve always been a saver but I discovered MMM in December 2015 (when I was 24). The realization I could retire at 35 really lit a fire under my ass to save even more and actually invest it. I was working through my CPA at a big 4 accounting firm at the time and hated every second of it. To be honest, accounting is boring and a ‘meh’ career at best, but the money is good so I will most likely stay on this path until I feel FI enough, if not actual FIRE.

I live in the most if not second most expensive city in Canada, sharing a small home with my SO that we purchased last year. I have no expensive hobbies other than travel and lead a pretty ‘boring’ life. I’m slowly getting healthier and into exercising but those things are harder for me than saving money.

The privilege – My parents paid for 3 out of my 4 years of university. That’s about 36k that I got for free which will never have to be repaid (I asked). That one year I paid for and for the 2 years I lived on campus I paid for myself through part time jobs before and during university. I also went back to live with my parents for one year rent free during my ***7*** years of working, which was a nice boost to my net worth during that time.

Here are the numbers!

**The goals**

My spending goal in retirement for one person is $20,000-$30,000 per year (as part of a $40,000-$60,000 spend household). I expect my SO to pay their own way on this FIRE journey. The dream at the moment looks like one year on one year off long term slow travel, most likely for 5ish years of travel. On the off years, we could work, volunteer, whatever. These FIRE plans are not that defined because who knows what I’ll feel like in 5-10 years.

All else being equal (is it ever?) I expect to achieve the following net worth milestones at the following ages:

   

**Annual Spend (individual)**

&#x200B;

| **Annual Spend (individual)** | **$20,000.00** || **$25,000.00** || **$30,000.00** ||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| FI @ 4% | $500,000.00 |29| $625,000.00 |30| $750,000.00 |33|
| FI @ 3.5% | $571,428.57 |30| $714,285.71 |31| $857,142.86 |34|
| FI @ 3.25% | $615,384.62 |30|$769,230.77|32| $923,076.92 |35|
| FI @ 3% | $666,666.67 |31| $833,333.33 |32| $1,000,000.00 |35|

\^the above does not account for market corrections/recessions. If one happens tomorrow obviously those ages will change. ***(BAHAHAHAHA COVID)***

My flair is based on the first goal - $500k for 20k of spending at 4%. Is that going to be the number I FIRE at? Probably not, given the expectation of a low growth environment in the near future and my young age at the expected time. But it’s a number that I would feel comfortable about enough to shift into something more chill. It’s possible and even likely that I’ll experience the golden handcuffs phenom and stay for a while past that though to feather the nest and add security.

Future plan/goals – I have no interest in having children, which enables my fast FIRE journey and long term travel plans. ***Currently we live in a small bungalow in Scarbs with a basement unit that pays rent. Looking forward to selling in the next few years and buying a teardown to re-build, no enjoying living in an old house.*** While Canada is great, it’s also possible that I will be OK with living somewhere else with single payer health care long term (I hate winter).

**Income history and Net Worth**

I started my career at a big 4 accounting firm making 45k, then 50k the next year, then 60k the next. These are standard salaries for this job in my city – Toronto. During this time I was renting a place downtown with a roommate or SO.

After leaving the firm my first job out was at 75k, and I moved to live with my parents for that year. Getting rid of rent was amazing for my net worth. Then I moved to a more interesting job that I thought I would love for 80k and started paying rent again. ***Then I got bored and moved to my current job, where I made 95k the first year and now 100k with very generous 20-30% bonuses. First year we (my SO and i) lived downtown paying rent, now paying down a mortgage.***

I do have access to a side hustle that I started participating in around 2016. It’s very CPA specific and involves helping incoming CPAs get feedback for their practice exams in preparation for the qualification exams we have to write in this profession (PEP and CAP for those in the know). I think I made <$2000 the first year I did it, but it grew steadily and I made $***33,000*** last year from this.

My net worth started at -$10,000 on the day I graduated university in the summer of 2013. That debt was owed to my parents for a lavish long trip I took that summer which I repaid in my first year of working. No regrets. After I started working and saving, it began steadily going up. My records are spotty in the beginning, since I was just saving to save.

I reached the 200k milestone sometime in April 2018 at 26 years old, 1 year and 5 months after 100k (4 years, 7 months after my first day of work). It definitely gets faster (especially if you have year of not paying rent!).

All else equal and barring a downturn, I hope to achieve the 300k milestone around winter 2019. Depending on the side hustle this year and with my increased income, here’s hoping for Dec 2018 instead of March 2019. Well that didn’t work out, but that was mainly because of saving up for the house during the low market in the 2018 winter and the closing costs.

Apr/2019	$300,030.50

Why the big jumps toward the end there? Bonuses and side hustle money coming through (it comes in large chunks) and the tenant providing first and last helped as well.

The 300k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2019, one year after 200k. It’s definitely getting easier and easier to amass more money as my income grows and the growth compounds due to the nest egg size.

I’m hoping 400k comes around the same time next year. Side hustle should be around the same this year but we’re planning a lavish vacation and some minor renovations***.***

***The 400k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2020, one year after 300k. 500k is less than a year away should my plans for 2020 work out. More on that in the next update if it works out \^\_\^***

**Monthly expenses**

***Here are the 2019 expenses and 2020 so far. Expenses have definitely increased slightly since we are now homeowners which comes with all kinds of costs.*** 

For a millennial living in a huge high COL city, I don’t spend a lot of money. This has enabled me to save a ton of money even on my previously medium salaries.

***Variable mortgages are great during times like this, April was our first reduced month. Renovations are about halfway done; hopefully we’ll finish in a few months. We pay insurance in a lump sum payment, my work pays for my phone, and any medication/dental not covered by work health insurance is in misc. I’ve worked from home for majority of March and all of April so transportation costs are not normal. Unfortunately it looks like vacation is out of the question this year so we’ll save a few thousand there in the overall figures.***

Please keep in mind that these expenses are for myself only. My SO and I split household expenses and spend our own money on items like clothes or video games. I don’t foresee our essentials spending increasing above what it currently is and the tenant is very helpful in reducing those costs to a level where it is cheaper to live in the house than our previous condo rental without taking into account future selling prices, etc. We did consult a rent vs buy calculator before purchasing and the house was still in the buy zone which is rare for Toronto. ***I foresee us staying here for around 2-5 years before flipping into a newer home.*** 

**Investments**

My tax advantaged accounts are maxed out and self-managed through a DIY brokerage. My taxable contributions are split evenly between the same self-managed DIY brokerage and a robo advisor for shits and giggles. The robo advisor is winning at the moment, because I view my DIY brokerage holdings as a whole unit so my taxable account gets the brunt of the bonds (low rate environment).

The DIY Portfolio is as follows:

***Cash: 0.6% (preference is 0%), everything is in the market J***

***Bonds: 1.9% (preference is 5%), sold it all in March to buy more ETFs.***

***REITs: 2.3% (preference is 2.5%), VRE mostly. Also meh about this allocation.*** **~~This will go the way of the bonds when I need to rebalance if the market makes moves. Since I own a home now this is not required.<~~** ***that’s what I said last year, thinking REITs are inversely related to general market performance. Not for this recession….***

***Canadian dividend stocks: 4.1% (preference is 2%, my investing strategy used to be dividend based so this is a remaining position from then), CDZ.***

***Canadian Market: 1.7% (preference is 2.5%),VCN***

***US Market – hedged to CAD: 24.6% (preference is 25.5%),VUS/VSP***

***US Market – unhedged: 26.9% (preference is 25.5%), VUN/VTI(n USD)***

***International (both developed and developing) – unhedged: 37.9% (preference is 36.5%) XEF+XEC/VXUS(in USD)***

My robo advisor has split my investments as follows:

Cash: 6%

Bonds: $9%

Low carbon global stocks: 30%

Canadian stocks: 24%

Global stocks: 16%

Cleantech stocks: 15%

***I finally called them to change my risk level from 8 to 9.***

I’d love any advice on my allocations. I rebalance when I invest so it’s a bit slow.

Is there anything else you want to know?

I am a 35M, NW 1.5MM while my fiancée 35F has effectively 0 net worth. We are getting married soon and I retired just before getting engaged. After we got engaged, we discussed our finances so she got the complete details about my situation and FIRE. She now has made it a priority to RE as well and this is where it gets messy.

I do not want to work again. In the jobs I have held, my coworkers were great, the jobs themselves were fulfilling at times and honestly I think I enjoyed my career as much as I could; but that being said I still loathe working, which is why I made FIRE a priority. I simply hate being kept to someone else’s schedule and forced to go to any job every day.

At 60k per year as a single male my expenses are more than covered but my fiancée and I would like a more comfortable life as a couple so our target NW as a couple is 2.5MM. My current plan is to live frugally and use my investment income to cover our expenses so she can put the bulk of her salary to work toward her added NW of 1 MM which would basically take 10 years .My fiancée is like me and while she enjoys her job she would much rather be retired. I could probably cut her working years to 5 instead of 10 by working but now that I am out of the rat race I can not imagine dragging myself back in.

As of now my fiancée completely understands the work I put in and does not blame me for not wanting to work but I can’t help but feel like this could lead to resentment in the future. Can anyone share their experiences where one SO stayed working not necessarily because they wanted to but because they had to while the other one retired. Any advice on supporting your spouse in what could be a decade of working while you are lucky enough to be retired?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have gotten some comments saying if markets are good my 1.5 MM will speed up the climb to 2.5MM NW but that is assuming conditions are good and I have specifically assumed they won't be and I have basically treated the climb in net worth from 0 to 1MM

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I am apparently terrible at giving all the details, if I were to be at home I would be a home maker and take on all the responsibilities that came with that. Imagine a 1950s house hold with the genders reversed but we will not have children.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: I have realized I have another reason for staying retired while my future wife works which is listed below, thoughts?

I'm not concerned about her money habits in that it is irresponsible but that FIRE is a massive undertaking for someone to fulfill and she is just starting on that path. It may not work out but by covering all of our expenses and allowing her to potentially save all her income it allows her to retire as quickly or as slowly as she likes without her feeling like I am pressuring her.

I am from Europe. Moved a year ago in the US and love it here.First thing I did after starting my job was researching about the system here and I immediately started to build credit history and also opened a 401K. My colleagues are all Europeans (we are a small branch from a EUR company) and they all did the same. 

My wife who is working in a US company with American colleagues got a conversation at the office today. Out of 10 people, only one had a 401K (the company has a 401K plan with 50% match up to 6%) and he said he didn’t know how it works and he is just following his advisor advices. The 9 other employees (aged 23-35) either didn’t know what it was or said things like “who cares about retirement”. 
I related the same experience with a couple people I met here but thought they were exceptions.

One thing I noticed in one year in the US (and I lived in multiples countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and in Canada) is that I have never seen a country where people talk that much about money and where it matters so much. 
Yet it seems like a lot of people are ignorant about retirement, far more than in other developed countries. 

Why is that? Is it a problem of the current generation, has it always been the case? Why is there not more education (school, work, parents) about it? I am not even talking fire here but basic retirement.
Being in a world where the information is so easy to access yet be ignorant on that (or any important life topic for that matters) is beyond me.

I need a smartphone for work and my beloved Android phone finally died a death after 4+ years. I did some research into phones and decided on an older iPhone, the 5s. Simple to use, good size, it was on sale because it's an older model, and I had vouchers to use in Argos (the store I got it from in the UK), which meant it was a pretty good deal.

I went into the store to pick it up and the guy who was selling it to me pretty much openly mocked me - ""they still make THIS?"", ""I didn't even know we still sold this model"", it was as if I'd asked for an eighties brick phone, not a perfectly functional modern smartphone that does everything I need it to do and more. He took his own iPhone 7 out of his pocket and started showing me how amazing it was. I asked what was different about it and he looked at me as if I was a complete moron and said 'this is the LATEST model'. He clearly thought I was insane or stupid for buying the 5s, or maybe just too poor to afford anything better.

As he rung up my purchase, he was complaining about having to work overtime because he'd had an unexpectedly high electricity bill and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself suggesting that if he hadn't just spent almost £700 on a brand new phone for no apparent reason, he'd have that money and more in the bank. I'd never so clearly seen the forces of marketing in action before - this guy with a minimum wage job who was barely getting by felt like he needed the latest, newest phone just because. And he was mocking me for having researched an older model so carefully and made sure it met all my needs before I parted with the money for it. It made me more determined than ever not to be one of those people who mindlessly consume and throw their money away that they work so hard for. Eye-opening. ",financialindependence

@3%: $1,153,683 @4%: $1,617,896 @5%: $2,261,566 @6%: $3,151,295 @7%: $4,377,398 @8%: $6,061,991

Because I have reached coast fire, I’d like to spend the next 12 months spending every dollar that I earn from my job. 

Why? A few reasons...I have lived very, very modestly the past 7 years since I’ve graduated and saved/invested almost everything (70%+ savings rate for all my working years). I have purposely lived like a very poor student and instead of lifestyle inflation, participated in lifestyle deflation. Had very close high school friend of mine recently pass away suddenly at such a young age. This shook me and I realize I can’t take anything for granted. I recently turned 30 and I don’t know if this is an early mid-life crisis, but I’m already thinking about my mortality. 

What do I plan to spend the money on? After covering my regular annual expenses, I calculate I’ll have roughy $70K (after-tax) over the course of 12 months to spend. My plan is to spend it on the below...
1. 2 week vacation with my immediate family (father, mother, sister) to St. Maarten (or equivalent if Covid makes things complicated) - $10K
2. 1 week vacation to Disneyworld with my nieces and nephews - $5K
3. One time financial gift/small token of appreciation to my parents since I’m forever grateful to them for paying for my college - $15K
4. Used luxury sports car - $50K

A few questions. Has anyone done something similar to this? Almost like a 1 year “hall pass” to just splurge after saving/investing diligently for a while? Is there anything I’m overlooking or need to consider? Is the future value of my current portfolio after 35 years reasonably accurate (3-8 percent average growth/year)? Is this stupid to do in the middle of a pandemic? Why shouldn’t I do this? 

Any feedback, advice, thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all.",financialindependence

26 years old.
401k - 90k, HSA - 10k, IRA - 30k, Brokerage - 70k, Emergency fund - 13k (building up to 20k)

I save a lot of money, but I haven't really had a short term goal until recently. For about a year, I've been contemplating purchasing a home. I'm looking at about 50k for a down payment. Assuming the market remains strong within the next few weeks, I'll liquidate most of my brokerage account to get this money + extra for closing fees.

But here's the thing - that money gives me security. It's nice to know that it's there if I need it. Even though by the numbers I believe I'm prepared to purchase a home, it's still a scary prospect. It also feels like I'm taking a huge hit to my FIRE goals, even though the money will still exist, just in a different form.

Initially it would have been 2023 but now it will be end of 2019. Main reason is the 'anything can happen and we will not be able to enjoy the fruits of our work'. 

In the last few months a lot happened health wise in our family. I got a nerve palsy (without any realy reason) which made walking longer distances or climbing stairs very hard. Now after 3 months it is slowly getting better. My wife got a cyst in her ovaries, my cousin had a stroke, my other cousin got breast cancer, my mother was in hospital for the first time since 40 years because of back pain and so on. Too much happened.

So we crunched our numbers (we should be at 1.4 mio Euro - mostly in real estate) and we prefer to live our life now healthy instead of more luxury in a wheel chair. And we will be in Thailand most of the time so costs will be lower anyway. And as we do not have chrildern we can also use up a big chunck of this money.

We will continue with our plan to buy a 2 bed 2 bath condo in Thailand end of the year or beginning of 2019 and then when we sell our house in Germany we will buy a house in Thailand. 

One more year of work (freelance programmer but with a contract until end of next year) and then only reading, playing video games, riding my motor bike, flying some drones and more video and arcade games. And hopefully there will by a group of people who enjoy board games. No more stress!

I want to thank this sub from the bottom of my heart. 

The only options I’d presented were stay working or quit.  Well, after a chorus of “go part time” I started to wonder- that’s not an option at my company, but what’s the harm in asking? 

I had a heart to heart with my boss with whom I am very close.  He knows I’ve always wanted a baby and was aware how special being pregnant was to me (we are very close, like family - he’s my parents age and has often referred to me as like another daughter). Anyway, there’s history there and he knows my heart and that I’m devoted to my job but that I’ve always craved being a mother. 

So I basically leveled with him and told him I was desperate to see my daughter more but I still wanted to work- what about part time? I figured his was a hopeless ask since our company is a massive power company corporation employing mostly men and there weren’t any special arrangements.  I was wrong. 

To those who nudged me to ask about part Time - GOD BLESS YOU.  

My new arrangement is every Monday is a work from from home w/in home nanny. I still get paid and work but if she is upset she can sit on my lap and I sill put her down for naps and giggle as she plays in the background. I get every other Friday off.  So that means I work at the office 3 days one week, 4 days the next.  She is not in daycare. My family pitched in to watch her and so she’s never set foot in daycare. I want to cry with relief as I type this. 

The three day weeks are perfect and the four day weeks are a little too long but god bless this sun for helping me navigate an incredibly difficult, fragile, emotional, impulsive time.  We are already planning epic trips with the babe and the money I pull in will continue to leverage her life and ours.  

Anyway- to those moms who are torn, I’ll say the mantra I have been telling myself “EVERYTHINGS NEGOTIABLE”

The babe is happy, I’m over the moon. The security and purpose I get from the job is worth more than I can say.  Being my baby’s mom is worth even more than that. This part time balance works for our family.  Cheers and goodnight!

I realized there are a lot of things I would do differently.

Here are the two most important for me.

First, I realize I should have started a side gig a lot earlier.  My side gig money went straight to my nest egg, and made it grow.  

Second, I also realized that I should not have bought so many houses along the way.  I have owned five houses, and each time I changed houses I lost a chunk of money to realtors and fees.  I should have either not bought a house at all, or at the very least, waited a bit longer to buy my first house and bought a larger one I could have stayed in long term.

I love the community and I love the level of commitment for everyone helping people figure out what I consider to be the holy grail of life: FIRE

Somewhat meta, I'm interested to see how this sub does through the next correction. I get the feeling that I'm a little older than most FI subscribers. To think it has been almost a decade since Great Recession is crazy to me but it also means that a lot of us haven't seen a recession of their invested assets. 

I (fortunately) have much more money in the market now than I did back in December of 2007. That said, I did have a real level of money in the markets back then; I can't explain to people who didn't live through it how **sickening** that recession was.

I guess that's what I want to convey to FI in this post: The next recession does not match your expectations on your Excel.xls spreadsheet. I remember that I had conservative growth rates as my projections and thought that I was set. Technically, my growth rates flushed out in the end. What I wasn't prepared for is seeing my losses in the short term.

It's easy when we are projecting the market over time but, as cocky as you think you are, you are mental mess when you lose half of your assets. You are probably telling yourself that you have a big, badass plan to ""buy more"" in the next down turn. Let me tell you, if it's anything like the last one you will probably be cowering in the corner. 

You'll probably cancel your automatic investments that you were once confident would lead you into wealth - cash will be king by the way. You'll probably rationalize your auto investment cancellation by being smart because you need to build a cash hoard - you figure you'll be fired.

Your FI plan is also going to be attacked in the court of public opinion. I was skeptical of CNBC and the like leading into 2008 but I found myself still watching it during the meltdown - the credit markets seized up entirely. Prestigious investment firms shuttered their doors. No one knew who the next huge company to fold would be - you probably will have friends at those firms and you'll probably think you are being a good friend by monitoring their situation, too.

And then there is the non-media stuff that just ruins you. For me, this is when the news camera showed up on my block. One of my neighbors that I kind of knew (walked a small dog everyday, said hello to, seemed well put together), slammed a bullet into his temple. Turns out he was a commodities trader who was at the losing end of his bets. Left his family behind as he caught the bullet in the head.

I'm not saying the next ""correction"" will be the same as the ""recession."" It will probably be much more mild. My final point is the old adage, ""Man plans, God laughs.""

Edit: as requested, some numbers:
Starting balance was about $36k. I immediately knocked off about $3k of that upon graduation with some leftover scholarship money.

I was paying it off for about 2.5 years total. 

During the first 6 months I only paid about $400 each month, give or take, depending on how much I could - I was working part time and living abroad and was pretty tight on cash.

When I moved back to the USA I landed a pretty sweet job and was living with my parents for part of the time, and with roommates after that. 

I make $55k/year and I was paying anywhere between 800-1500/month at that time. 

I was able to use my yearly bonus (extra 1400) and some gift money from my birthday and Christmas to further speed up the process.

They were various Unsubsidized Stafford Loans at 6.8% interest.

Generally, as advice? I just lived like I was still a student even though I was making ""professional"" money. Yeah, I had to buy some nice clothes so I would look reasonable, but other than that - transit/biking to work, cooking at home, not going out too often, cheap travel (camping, road trips).

Hello everybody!  FIRE has been the only thing keeping me going in my current career (found MMM 5 years ago).  I've been experiencing extreme burnout for the last 2 years, and it has been affecting me mentally.  I just started going to a therapist yesterday over this (hopefully this helps!)...

It's made me think... Is the pain and suffering of grinding through a career you hate worth FIRE?  Am I missing the point of FIRE going down this path?

I feel like I should ""enjoy the process"" rather than the destination.  I question whether ""magical happiness"" happens the second I'm FI.

How do you know you'll enjoy RE?  What a waste of time would it be to grind to FI; to realize your passions/hobbys/whatever earns money/paycheck, meaning you could have left your corporate job years ago?

Not sure how to test out RE; but I'm suspicious I wouldn't enjoy it FOREVER (maybe that's a sign I'm a boring person).

Only a very small minority of individuals have sufficient assets to retire early at more than a subsistence level.

Hello FIRE community. Recently I crossed the 400K milestone meaning I'm 1/3 way there. This came nearly as a shock when I reflected on my pre-FIRE self: spendy, #YOLO, and all about instant gratification.

I often see minimalist, frugal type of OPs achieving FIRE within a very small time frame. Or, there are the OPs with IT expertise who score big bucks in the Valley. Both are truly enviable, but both **very different** from the life that I live (ok income, very high COL, desire to maintain a certain lifestyle). **Through the years, I've found that for people like myself, it's important to understand my few CORE NEEDS/WANTS, find creative ways to fit them in my budget, and cheap out 100% on the rest.** To me, it's all about meticulously dollar-cost averaging and being flexible in a sustainable way. 

I want to give back to this community by sharing my experience on how I changed that pattern and caught up - that with a bit of lifestyle adjustment and a decent amount of determination, good habits along with wealth can be accumulated at a decent rate, given permissible market conditions.

|2019|100k|386k|
|2020|111k|402k|

My NW consists of my brokerage account balances of $185k (ETFs, mutual funds, single stocks for fun; diversified into global markets with a pre-set allocation), retirement accounts of $100k (global ETFs), cash and FX of $17k, and half a property valued at $100k.

Largest expenses: $1100 rent; $600 food; $400 to parents; $400 on unrequited passions which are now expensive hobbies

Things that helped me get ahead: 

1. Upbringing in a frugal household. Parents' combined incomes never even came close to mine, but they've always lived below their means which allowed them to save continuously. Absolutely no debt; even the home was bought with cash in full. The upbringing definitely made being frugal a lot more natural to me when I put my mind to it.
2. Merit based scholarships for college which covered tuition. Disliking debt, parents took out  retirement savings to help with room and board. I took part time jobs, but spent my summers working meaningful internships which didn't necessarily pay. 0 NW at graduation.
3. Majored in things that were most conducive to employment and kissed my passions goodbye. Hustled self into a decent paying banking job before graduation. Immediate cash flow after graduation.

Things that worked against me:

1. Embraced my life as an income earning young adult way too hard. I blew money on stupid nice things because ""i am finally standing on my own two feet"".
2. Too confident that I'd continue to climb the corporate ladder infinitely. Which directly resulted inn overspending and underinvesting in the early half of my career, missing out on an extended period of the bull run.  

  
Lessons:

In 7 years I went from stupid spendy to aggressively saving. The most important thing that happened was probably a shifted view on spending which dialed down my expenses in a **sustainable way. Here are few things that really helped me:**

1. **Intentionally be looking for deals:** supermarket sales after 8pm; buy 2 get 1 free tissue boxes; collect and use coupons; shop around before committing to a big purchase, etc. Buy second hand. Fix/do things around the house by myself. Instead of buying new mops I cut old t-shirts and towels to mop the floor with. It may seem small but it does add up. **This is the part where I live significantly below my means.**
2. **Cook simple meals at home** whenever possible. Cooking itself can be relaxing, the food is healthier, and the savings are hard to beat.
3. **Be selective and mindful when eating out**. I pre-game at home when I can, so that when I'm out at clubs I only need to order 4 drinks instead of 14. Take doggie bags home from restaurants. Also this might sound weird, but sometimes I intentionally order dishes such as stews when eating out so that I pack the broth and can toss together a quick meal at home the day after to **dollar-cost average** the meals.
4. **Travel wisely**. I use my mileage and loyalty points, fly red eye when I can handle it, travel off-season to save cost. And I always haggle.
5. Go out and get the stuff I truly want. Rinse. Repeat.

967,"Our Story (33M/31F): Going from $250k in Student Loans to $250k in Net Worth With Type I Diabetes, Two Kids, and a Saga Across Three States.",,783,iakz3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/iakz3g/our_story_33m31f_going_from_250k_in_student_loans/,1597546488.0,"## In the Beginning (Post Undergrad Years) (23M/21F)

Our  story begins pretty much the same time as our relationship. I met who would eventually be my wife during our last year in undergrad where we  were both majoring in Molecular Biology. I had switched majors from  Aerospace Engineering but that's a story for another time.

My  wife graduated and began studying for the MCAT a semester before I  finished. She spent some time shadowing doctors and didn't find the ones  she shadowed to be that happy, lessening the appeal of going through  med school. She also feared the debt necessary to fund that education  and so decided she'd be more interested in a medical profession that  provided more opportunity to change specialties so she decided not to  take the exam. Long story short we both entered the labor market in Fall  of 2010.

My first job after  college was as a research embryologist for a small research lab I found  on Craigslist of all places. I had about $23k of debt from undergrad and  started at $15/hr but opted to stay on my parent's medical insurance  which added the equivalent of $1/hr extra. We had access to a 401k with  no matching to which I did **not** contribute. I was able to work up to 1.5 hours of overtime per week and did so as often as I could. **My net worth was -$23k**.

My  wife started as a research assistant with a State University lab making  $31k which included what I know now is a very rare automatic  contribution to a pension to be paid starting at age 65 with a benefit  based on years of service. Fortunately she had taken enough college  level coursework in high school to only need 3 years to obtain her  bachelor's degree and was able to work enough in college to avoid taking  student loans. I wasn't privy to her finances at the time but now know **she had a net worth of about $8k** from savings throughout her life.

We  moved in together shortly after starting these jobs but didn't combine  finances and split all our bills 50/50. I used my remainder after  monthly expenses to attempt to slowly pay down my student loan debt.  Foolishly I would calculate down to the last $50 of my checking account  and kept no emergency fund, a decision which my wife would argue with me  about until I finally decided to keep $500 as my maximum depletion  amount.

We both performed well at  our jobs and after 2 years I had increased my pay to $17/hr and was  still getting $1/hr extra by opting out of health insurance and staying  on my parent's plan. I had managed to get my student loan balance down  to about $10k but was still not contributing to retirement or saving  much of anything.

My wife was  feeling the itch to pursue a career in medicine and had decided that she  would apply for Physician Assistant school due to its greater specialty  flexibility over medical school. However, a prerequisite was direct  patient hours which she was not getting in her job as a research  assistant. She was able to find another opportunity with the University  as a Clinical Research Coordinator which gave not only patient contact  but came with a pay increase to $41k and continued contributions to the  pension plan.

We got engaged  shortly before my wife was accepted into PA school in another state and I  decided I would leave my job in order to move across the country with  her. We decided it might be a good time for me to pursue additional  education as well. I had been taking some courses online in my evenings  on statistics and programming and happened across the field of  bioinformatics. Having always been passionate about computers as a hobby  I saw bioinformatics as a way to combine biology and computer science  and hopefully advance my career outlook. Fortunately I found a master's  degree program that was available 100% remotely and I was accepted to  begin the same semester as my wife started PA school.

When we left our jobs our **combined net worth was about $0** with my $10k in outstanding undergrad loans and my wife's now $10k of savings.

## Back to School and Loading Up on Debt (26M/24F)

My  masters program took 24 months to complete and my wife's took 27. My  wife's program required students not take outside employment to not  interfere with rotations and coursework and I felt overwhelmed enough by  attempting to transition into more computer science heavy coursework  coming from a biology background that neither of us ended up working  during grad school.

I am a Type I  Diabetic (insulin dependent) and we started grad school shortly after  the ACA was passed, meaning I could no longer be denied coverage for my  preexisting condition. I purchased an insurance plan from the market  that covered the diabetes care I would need but had to pay for the  premium and co-insurance from our student loans.

By  the time we were finished we had accumulated $250k in student loans,  interest included. I had one paid internship in the middle of my program  where I earned $6k but otherwise we lived our entire lives on loans.  Most went to tuition, medicine, and rent but we did allow ourselves  occasional eating out, alcohol, and entertainment. We also got married,  and managed to keep the cost under $5k!

## Finishing Grad School, Starting Careers, a Family, and Medical Problems (28M/26F)

Fortunately  my internship finished with a job offer to return after graduation that  I accepted in yet another different state. I started while my wife was  finishing up PA school which caused us to live in different states for 3  months. I started at $72k with a generous benefits package including a  9% 401K match, an HSA with a $2,000 automatic employer contribution, and  health and dental insurance.

My  wife followed a few months later and was able to find a job after about a  month as a PA in a rheumatology practice. It was a contract-to-hire  position where she would either be hired or released after  six months.  Her six month contract was for $40/hr with no retirement benefits but  included medical which she declined as we were both on my work's plan.

We started our new careers with a **combined net worth of about -$240k**.

Happily,  we both found success in our new careers and enjoyed rapid advancement  and raises and as a unit averaged an 8% increase in pay per year over  the next five years. My wife was hired from her contract and got a bump  to $100k and began to receive a 4% retirement match if she contributed  6% of her base salary.

We both  began to take more of an interest in personal finance, but still hadn't  discovered the concept of financial independence. We were very motivated  to pay off our mountain of debt so began to track our expenses  diligently (first with Mint, now with YNAB). We contributed enough to  get our retirement match and everything else left at the end of each  month went towards loans.

Our jobs  are located in a HCOL area so we chose to live in an older apartment  complex our first two years and then transitioned to a town house 3  years ago where we still live. We have been paying $2,000/mo for a 3/2.5  1600sqft unit (not rennovated) which is very close to work so we don't  need to have much of a commute. We could definitely find lower rent  farther from work but it would add 45+ minutes each way.

As  we began to see serious progress on our student loans our interest in  personal finance grew and we discovered the idea of financial  independence. That concept still had to sit on the back burner for a  while since we decided paying off our loans would be a priority until  the remaining loans were at an interest rate < 4.5% which  unfortunately was only about $30k of our total balance.

After  6 months of working our net worth climbed to -$200k. Then -$150k after  12 months. We managed a pace of increasing our net worth through paying  off student loans to the tune of $100k/yr for almost exactly 5 years.

We hit **net worth $0 in August of 2018**  just as our first child was born. 3 weeks before he was born I had to  have a kidney removed due to a genetic condition which caused it to fill  with fluid and swell like a water balloon which destroys its ability to  filter. Fortunately we were already used to having maximum medical  expenses due to my diabetes so the pregnancy and the kidney removal  weren't really much of a factor financially due to hitting our out of  pocket max.

## Present Day (33M/31F)

We finally **paid off our student loans and hit $150k net worth in January of this year (2020)**.  We gave birth to our second child in March of this year just in time to  get home before the pandemic started to really spread. We are both  incredibly fortunate in that we have been able to continue working at  the same jobs and at the same pay as before the pandemic and that  allowed us to reach **$250k net worth**  this month. My Dad retired a few years ago and my Mom was forced into  retirement by the pandemic so we are also incredibly fortunate that they  are willing to watch the kids while we work. We pretty much just  flipped the switch of paying off student loans to contributing for  retirement so have really been enjoying actually getting to keep most of  our money this year instead of shoveling it into loans.

We  certainly experienced a lot of luck in our journey but also a lot of  hard work and made a pretty radical change in our lives that benefited  us immensely. This is now the longest thing I've ever written on Reddit so I should stop rambling here. Thanks for  reading!",financialindependence

Note, I'm mostly concerned about about future friends and potential romantic partners. I don't care what the average Joe thinks. 

I suppose I could always bullshit my way through it (""I'm a freelancer!""), but I'd prefer not to build any future friendships on a foundation of lies.

I'm also concerned about dating. I'm single, and prospective partners would probably be judgmental about my not having a job. I guess I could tell them I'm financially independent, but that could easily backfire (or attract them for the wrong reasons).",financialindependence

Please help me figure out my FIRE plans.,,780,aelkbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/aelkbf/recently_diagnosed_with_a_serious_genetic/,1547143234.0,"I'm 22 and was recently diagnosed with [fibronectin glomerulopathy](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fibronectin-glomerulopathy). It's extremely rare (only ~50 reported cases), so there's not much in the way of direct support. Essentially it means that my kidneys are failing at an unknown rate, it could be 5 years or it could be 60. Most likely I can expect somewhere around 15-20 years before complete kidney failure. Unfortunately kidney transplants don't cure the issue, as my body will just start fucking those up too.

Obviously not the news you want to hear when you're 22 and about to start your first job as a software developer. The rest of the post may be a bit ramble-y, but I have some questions that hopefully some here can address:

1) Despite having a diagnosis I don't have a clear grasp on my life expectancy. It's not yet clear how severely my kidneys are being damaged (I currently still have full kidney function as marked by my GFR, although I have some symptoms of kidney dysfunction which eventually led to the diagnosis). I could stable out or I could need a transplant every 5 years to stay alive. How should I plan with this in mind?

2) Since I can pretty safely assume that by 65 I would have had multiple transplants and my QoL would be decently hampered, it seems like tax-deferred accounts that I cannot withdraw from until retirement age should not be the largest of my accounts. What should I do instead?

3) Even if I save enough to FIRE, I live in the US. With healthcare as it is, am I trapped into working for insurance until I can no longer work? This one might be my biggest question.

4) I'm still on my parents' health insurance, and I can stay on it until I am 24 (EDIT: One poster corrected me that this is until 26, not 24). Does it make sense to switch ASAP to my employer's health plan so that I can lock in insurance in case the pre-existing condition protection goes away? Or should I wait until I'm 24?

5) This is a dominant trait, so it means no kids. Even if I were to adopt, I'm not sure it would be fair to put kids through that. This isn't a FIRE point but I just have to get it off my chest. I've always wanted to be a father someday.

Overall I'm just very lost. FIRE has been something I've wanted to do since I discovered it at 18, the plan was always to graduate college into a good job and save 50+%. Now it just seems like even if I FI, I can never ER.

So yesterday, I asked this sub [how you felt about your job](https://redd.it/8xaiig). How much happiness do you sacrifice by working, and do you feel like your current salary justifies that?

I'll be honest, I didn't expect to get >100 responses but I have really enjoyed reading each and every one of them.

Some of you [have it pretty good](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e2203i5/), while others [suffer quite a bit because of their job](
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e22tow6) (this one made me laugh, actually. I'm super sorry!)

All these responses inspired me to just go ahead and put it in a spreadsheet, which I now want to share with you again. I guess this is my way of giving back, as reading your answers really was fun and inspiring. If you commented on this post, then your answer should be somewhere in that spreadsheet. If not, then I'm sorry, I must have missed it. :(

I think the graph itself is not that interesting, and there is probably a lot wrong with it (from a data perspective). All the data points are basically my own interpretation of your replies, some of which were detailed but more often than not less-detailed ;-) [Comments like these were pretty easy to chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8xaiig/how_much_of_your_happiness_do_you_sacrifice_by/e22nju4/). You can see everything I did in the spreadsheet I linked to. I hope you don't hate me for it.

Also, I've changed the axes around, as mentioned by someone else. Your happiness sacrifice influences salary, not the other way around.

I like how most of you simply tolerate your jobs (about half of the replies). You don't love it, but the money is good and it provides a means to an end. 

This analysis also makes me appreciate my job more. Hell, I may still be in the honeymoon phase.

By the way, please don't take this too serious. I just wanted to see how the r/fire crowd feels about their jobs, and had a little fun with your reactions. I might have gone a little too far, I don't know lol.

Let me know if you have any questions! :)

1) Our office flooded at the start of the year and we had to relocate thrice before finding a permanent home.  As you can imagine this was disruptive.

2) We had over a 20% churn in the office this year, which for our ""rightly"" sized unit was a lot.  I believe the moves and some of the reasons listed below were directly responsible for this unusual  amount of churn.  Our 5 year average before this was less than 5%.

3) My old boss's boss was let's just say, incompetent.  This resulted in so many stressful situations for our office, where one minute we were asked to take a 25% cut to our operating budget and next minute everything was ok.  I saw my boss visibly age over the last year.  That person is now thankfully gone and lasted all of 8 months.  I can only speculate that the reason for our multiple moves was the ineptitude of this individual.

4) Lastly my boss of over 15 years finally left for a much better gig.  I am so happy for her but transitioning from her has not been easy.

In spite of so much turmoil, at least from my perspective, our unit has more than thrived but it has been an incredibly stressful year.  It's my opinion that one of the few things that has kept me sane is my journey to FI, and not losing it every time there is a new crisis is a direct result of knowing I would be ok financially no matter what.  **That feeling alone is worth so much and a reason to aim for FI.**

This sub often talks about the financial aspects of receiving a windfall, but I want to focus on the emotional aspects of inheriting a large some of money for those who are struggling with the emotions that come with receiving a large sum.  Managing your emotions can be as equally important as managing your money and the two often go hand in hand. I would like to share a bit about two different paths that my brother and I took and share some of the emotional struggles I have had with receiving a large sum of money from a young age and how I manage those emotions. I hope that this post can help other people who might have similar feelings to what I have experienced.

**Brief Background**

When I was in my first year of college, about 10 years ago, my final grandparent passed away. My brother and I received a lot of money, about 750k each.  By the time I received full ownership of the money at 25 years old, it had grown to 1.2 million due to most of the money already being invested.  

**What each of us did after receiving the inheritance**

My brother has always been a hard worker and it’s something I admire him for.  He was working in a dead end job he more or less enjoyed, but that didn’t pay well.  He decided to pursue something else a few years after receiving the money and went for his masters degree. He now works at a stable job that pays pretty well and that he loves.  He lives in a HCOL area and put down a large down payment on a wonderful house. When I was renting a room from him, he would leave early in the morning and get home later.  He probably put in 50+ hours every week and up to 60+ at times for the first couple of years.   As I said, my brother is a hard worker. There were many days or weeks that were very stressful and he was exhausted when he got home.  But now that he is more settled in the job, he takes off more from work to do the things he wants to do and indulges in some of his more expensive hobbies.  He has no intention of quitting his job and continues to gain a steady income.  On this sub, this is the recommended path. Work like you would have done if you hadn’t received a windfall and enjoy the benefits of it growing.   

For those of you like me who struggle with the recommended path I’ll share what I have done. I completed college and hopped around trying different jobs. First, I worked a job in my field of study.  Then I worked in retail for a bit before I tried a different type of job in my field of study.  I ended up having a mental breakdown in that job.  My next career decision took me to a low cost of living country where I now work teaching English.

For whatever reason, I have really struggled with working full time and adapting to adult life.  It could be argued that my inheritance has contributed to that as in full time jobs it’s really hard to stay motivated when rent and satisfying basic needs is not a concern if I leave my job.  It’s easy to transition the thought of “this isn’t worth it” into action.  It’s not that I’m a bad worker.  I always arrived on time to my shifts and rarely slacked off.  But after awhile in a job I start to realize the job isn’t really fulfilling and working for my mental health, and so I look for the next thing that I think will give me a sense of fulfillment.  Therefore, I don’t know if I would have adapted to full time work even if I hadn’t received my inheritance.

**Guilt**

There are some problems that come with receiving a lot of money.  I’m not saying these problems are worse than other peoples.  Just that there are problems and one of the main ones is the feelings of guilt that can come from receiving a large sum.   Over the years, I have felt a lot of guilt, whether from personal or societal pressures. I’m sure some of these aren’t only exclusive to people who have received money, but I still want to share them as I think they are pretty common among people who have received a windfall and are experienced to varying degrees at different times. Here is a list of some of those things:

1)feeling like I don’t deserve and didn’t earn the windfall.

2)feeling like I’m wasting my potential if I don’t do something special with the opportunity the money has given me.

3)feeling like my achievements are lesser than others.

4)feeling like I have to solve other people’s financial problems.

5)feeling bad for spending any of the money.

6)feeling like I’m not allowed to have problems.

Include separate for not having to struggle like other people?

**What has helped me with the guilt.**

It’s important to work on these feelings of guilt because if you don’t, you risk the chance of making unintelligent decisions.  Here are some things that have helped me in the past.

1) It’s really interesting how we view what people deserve or don’t deserve.  People tend to think good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, but the reality is a lot of life is random. So we might look at people working hard to get the same amount of money that was given to us and we feel guilty for not having to make the sacrifices they do. After all, we aren’t better than them so why do we deserve to not work like they do? But remember that the person who chose to give it to you deserved to give their money to whoever they wanted to. So I think it’s important to be constantly thankful for the people or person that gave it to you.  I feel less guilty when I see that money as something that was given to me so I could pursue whatever I want in life that makes me feel fulfilled and happy.  

Also, one of the things my therapist challenged me on is how to think about the idea of earning money. Have I earned my initial net worth by showing up at a job and exchanging my labor for money? No.  But all the additional earnings that my investments make, is earned money in a sense.  Not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that every dollar of gains is from money I chose not to spend, even when I could.  

2) The idea of potential is often associated with career, but that is only one aspect of your potential.  But because people mainly focus on career potential, people will judge you if you don’t use your money to further yourself in your career or to start a business.  There is really only one potential in your life that I believe matters, and that’s feeling fulfilled and satisfied with life.  So do whatever brings you long term fulfillment and figure out what is truly important for you and distinguish that from what other people think you should be doing.  For me, it’s working for some of my own money while also having a lot of free time to pursue my hobbies and activities.  This obviously changes over time so just be aware that what brings you satisfaction now will probably be different even a couple years from now.  

3) Guilt about potential plays a bit into guilt about achievements.  It’s easy to look at other people’s achievements and compare them to your own.  When I compare myself to what other people are doing with their lives, it’s easy to think I’m not doing enough and this is amplified with the false belief that because I have the financial resources to do anything I want, it means that I could do anything in life. When really it means that I can pursue anything that I am willing to make sacrifices for.  It’s easy to look at another person’s income on this sub and think ‘wow, if only I put in the effort like that person, I could make 150k+ too.’ But in reality, you don’t know the true amount of effort that that person has put to get there, effort that you might not even be capable of.  You don’t know how many things that person had to sacrifice, the amount of stress they endured, or their goals that motivated them to achieve that level of income.

But you know what you have sacrificed for your own personal achievements and they are things you can be proud of.  While it’s important to recognize other people’s achievements, it’s also important to recognize your own achievements and to take the time to be proud of them.

4)  My first reaction, and maybe yours too, to hearing someone having financial difficulties is to want to help them.  And if I were to feel guilty about the money I have, I would probably feel obligated to help them out financially.  But constantly doing that would set me on the path to giving all of my money away and prevent me from reaching my own goals.  I have found that most of the time, people end up solving their financial problems on their own and are really just looking to vent. Even just offering a listening ear is often a good enough way to help out your friends and family.

Now I’m not saying don’t ever give money to help people.  I think charity and helping out friends and family is noble and it is something I would like to do more of at some point in my life when I feel more income stable.  What I am saying is don’t ever feel obligated to give money to other people if you don’t want to or aren’t comfortable with it.  Personally, I have my own financial and life goals and I’m not comfortable giving away large sums. But, if charity is very important to you, select an amount you are comfortable donating or donate some time to help out.  

5) This can especially play off the feeling of not deserving the money you received.  So if you buy anything with ‘unearned’ money then you didn’t really earn that object and you shouldn’t be allowed to enjoy something that you didn’t earn.  But that type of thinking ruins the joy for anything that you spend money on, which is a lot of things in this life.  While I’m not advocating for spending without any care in the world, I am advocating for guilt free spending.   

To help prevent overspending, it’s important to still have a budget no matter your level of wealth.  Find an amount you are comfortable with spending per month/year and stick to that budget.  For me, I take out enough money to cover my basic needs and a little extra fun money, but I still leave enough to let my windfall continue to grow.  It can be easy to go over the budget when looking at your bank balance, but this is where a lot self-discipline comes into play.  This has serves two purposes: It prevents you from buying things frivolously and over time eroding your windfall.  And it also creates an artificial constraint where you begin to want to earn money.  As I said earlier, having such a large windfall has made money less of a motivation for me, but when I feel a constraint on spending, even an artificial one, it makes me want to earn money with my own skills.  The only exception I make is for important medical related things.

Developing some sort of professional skills is good and I really recommend any sort of skill that can be freelanced if you struggle with full time work.  It has been important for me to acknowledge that I wouldn’t have been able to pursue this kind of career path had I not received my inheritance.  Feeling like I am still having to use my own skills to earn additional money has given me quite a lot of personal satisfaction.

6) For the final point of not feeling like I can have my own problems. People are judgmental.  It’s a fact of life.  And people tend to look at those who have been very fortunate as not being allowed to complain about things or have their own problems.  But that’s not true.  Are my problems as stressful as someone who has to worry about not making rent and barely being able to feed their family?  Hell no! But someone having a more stressful situation than me doesn’t make my problems any less problematic for me.  So it’s okay for you to struggle with the guilt and other emotions that can come with having received a large windfall.   

**Conclusion**

I hope some of the things I have written can help you a bit to navigate the emotions with receiving an inheritance or windfall.  I would be interested to know in what other ways you have felt guilty or other ways in which you were able to manage some of your guilt.",financialindependence
980,10 Years: From disability to half a million,,776,5xe7vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5xe7vj/10_years_from_disability_to_half_a_million/,1488588417.0,"

Howdy folks,

I recently logged into my investment account to get tax forms, and I noticed I’ve hit a personal milestone.  I just wanted to share with somebody.

I have cerebral palsy.  10 years ago I was in college, living off a disability check of $620 / mo.  I won’t lie, I wasn’t *really* unhappy, but getting by on so little was stressful.  There was this constant overhead of tracking every little purchase.  Me and my folks weren’t on the best of terms, but my mom always sent me leftovers home when I visited.  Still, I ate so much pasta that to this day I dislike Italian food.

Fast-forward to graduation.  I’m off disability and I’ve landed my first ‘real’ job!  I cannot describe how freeing it was to walk into the store and be able to afford any groceries I wanted without having to keep a running tally in my head.

As my income expanded, my spending staid low.  I’ve tried to loosen up a little over the years, but habits forged in poverty stay with you for life I suppose.

I realized that I didn’t really want a fancy house or car.  All I really wanted was the certainty that I’d *never* be that poor again.  This was the first step in my journey for financial independence, though I didn’t know the concept then.

Today, my investments stand at a little over half a million.  A 3% SWR would net me a bit over twice as much as I ever collected in disability, and it’s a damn fine feeling.  I really need to thank all my math teachers that had such patience with me over the years.  I don't think anyone, (myself included) expected I'd be where I am today.",financialindependence

How did my second year of RE go amidst COVID-19 and everything else that happened in 2020?  Read on to find out! :-) 

As usual, I've provided the TL/DR up front, but encourage you to read the qualitative details in the body of the post as I think that a story is so much more than just some numbers and bullet points.

For those who aren't familiar with my story, here are links to the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/)  from early 2019 and [1 Year Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/f261kn/update_1_year_in_and_loving_it_35_11m_luck/) in early 2020.

TL/DR:

* Net worth increased from $1.40M to $1.61M
* Spent  $30,600 which is under my budget of $33500. This was despite donating an unbudgeted $5400 to charitable organizations
* Cancelled most my of travel plans and adapted to COVID shelter-in-place orders
* Got an article written on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanderousseau/2020/03/05/36-year-old-retiree-5-years-without-paying-housing/) about me
* Invited to a WNYC radio program about finances, but it didn't materialize because of COVID.
* Joined the board of directors and became an officer at one of my queer summer camps
* Didn't meet any of my goals I set out for 2020
* Played A LOT of board and video games online

Next parts I'll break into sub-headings if you want to go to specific parts:

* Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

# Life in a Time of Covid

2020 will almost certainly be remembered and defined by COVID and the changes that came from it. I have a friend who was already ringing alarm bells by mid-January about its possible impact, so I had some time to process and mentally prepare for things once the shelter-in-place orders actually hit in March.

Despite being a fairly low risk to severe impacts of COVID (relatively young and no conditions that pre-dispose myself to severe complications), I chose to take what most would consider to be low risk approach for reasons including, but not limited to, wanting to minimize my potential risk to others and that the long-haul effects of the virus are still very unknown. I have the privilege of not needing to work and put myself at risk and I want to ensure that I'm not contributing to the risk of those who don't have a choice and/or are vulnerable.

*Note: Everyone has their own situation and I'm not attemtping to shame anyone for their personal choices. As someone who is part of the queer community, I think the AIDS crisis is a good, but imperfect, analogy and lesson at how shaming does not work and discussion of harm reduction is the most effective tactic. The limitation of that analogy is that you are effectively only putting yourself and your sexual partners at risk, whereas with COVID, you could really be harming a lot more people who haven't opted in to your risk profile. In short, there are personal decisions that people need to make like seeing their family or having some companionship, but I will in no way condone egregious actions like large unmasked gatherings.*

As an extroverted person who would host regular board game nights, go rock climbing with my climbing partner at the gym, see theater productions, go to board game conventions with thousands of people, and travel to multiple international destinations each year, this year has certainly been difficult. It isn't the year I planned, but I have tried to make the best of it as possible.

How have I adapted to varying shelter in place orders and tried to salvage a pretty bad year?

* Created a couple of Discord servers to maintain contact with various friend groups
* Played board games online using Tabletop Simulator with Discord - I logged over 450 hours on Tabletop Simulator alone!
* Played video Games - Logged 350 hours of Civilization 6 and 175 hours of Hades
* Got a crash pad and been rock climbing outdoor (past two months)
* Movie nights over Zoom/Discord
* Volunteer work online - phonebanking for elections, virtual summer camp activities, virtual workshops.

Basically - Discord and online video/board games have been keeping me sane.

# Major Life Events

Content/Trigger warning - Death and suicide mentioned in the next set of bullet points

* Became a first time uncle but unfortunately couldn't visit my niece. Hoping it will happen sometime by the end of 2021 or early 2022, depending on when I can get a vaccine.
* Had an acquaintance/former coworker take his own life at the beginning of the pandemic (stock market falling, depression, and pandemic stress all contributed).  This particularly impacted me because unlike the next life item, I didn't have the chance to say ""goodbye"". When I officially quit my job and turned my laptop in January, I was going to see him in the office, but I was running late to another commitment. I thought I'd be able to catch up with him some other time, but unfortunately that wasn't meant to be. My fondest memory is when we went to see a World Series game together. It was a bucket list item for me and while no one else was wanting to shell out the cash, he gladly joined me and we had a blast. We got to see Game 2 of the 2010 World Series @ AT&T Park with Matt Cain pitching a gem of a game and a wild 8th inning where the Giants scored two runs via walks and exploded to a blow out victory.
* This summer I had my mom call me and ask for me to hop on a plane to visit becuase my grandma was in the hospital and only had a few more days to live.  I packed up my stuff that night and took the first flight out in the morning. My grandparent passed away (not COVID) about two weeks later and luckily all of our family was able to spend time with her at a family member's home in pallative care and got to say our goodbyes in person.  Note - family visited while masked and socially distanced. She lived a very long life and was able to pass away with family around her, which is about as much as I could ask for given all the other heartbreaking stories I've heard this year of family members not being able to say goodbye.
* I was voluntold (I was happy to help out though) to be the coordinator/project manager and to delegate tasks and facilitate decisions between my grandma's 6 children. THIS WAS STRESSFUL. My grandma didn't even have any assets to squabble over, but decades of emotions and inter-personal conflicts surfaced. Additionally COVID created a complicating situation where, at the time, the church allowed a maximum of 30 people for the service. Problem is that my grandma has 24 direct descendents and counting spouses and step kids that put the number at 35.  This doesn't even include family friends and/or her extended adopted family (she was among one of 6 adopted children). In the end, everything ""worked out"" but not without a ~~bit of~~ LOT OF stress working through the guest list.

# Finances

**Net Worth:** Increased from $1.40M to $1.61M

**Income:** Dividends + Capital Gains: $18,100  (The Capital Gains were via distributions, not sale of investments)

**Spending:** $30,600 out of $33,500 budget. My budget at my current net worth would represent a 2.1% withdrawal rate

The linked image provides my 2020 [Budget, 2020 Actual Spend, and Differences](https://imgur.com/a/MjnLZEq).

You'll note that there are some big differenes in planned versus actual, namely my travel spend was virtually non-existant and I decided that I wanted to donate more to charity this year given that I have more than enough and there were many people and organizations that didn't have enough. Below lists out my notable notable big ticket expenditures for the year.

* Charitable Giving - $5400
* Laptop - $1600
* Rowing Machine - $1050
* Various REI Purchases - $1200

My food budget shrank significantly as I didn't eat out and rarely did take out - it was only $3500 out of a $6000 budget. I still ate well, but did a lot more home-cooking and simpler food - a lot of stuff that my mom would make for me as a kid. I fully expect that my food budget will go up once COVID restrictions lift, but I imagine that they won't go back to pre-COVID spending levels.

For 2021 I will keep my budget the same at $33,500 but will likely come in way under it with my non-charity expenses, but I will probably end up covering the difference by contributing more to charities.

**FIRE Actions:**

* Converted $12,555 from my Rollover IRA into Roth IRA as part of a Roth IRA ladder ($12,400 standard deduction but slight variance at end of day)
* Was vigilant and didn't take any buy/sell action despite the dip in the spring! I briefly lost my two comma status and I got a little bit of anxiety at the trough, but stayed firm with the buy/hold Bogleheads strategy.
* Less of a FIRE action, but more of a reduction in my FIRE risk - CA AB1482  went into effect 1/1/2020 which is effectively a state-wide rent control which limits rent increases to inflation plus 5% per year. I was conservative in my withdrawal rate knowing that a sudden rent hike could happen and I needed to account for it. But now having additional protection via this law, it means I'm EXTRA safe with my withdrawal rate.

**Lean FIRE ""Trial-Run""**

If there was one silver lining 2020 with respect to FIRE, 2020 showed me that a realistic lean FIRE number for me would be around $23,000, which were my expenses this year excluding my charitable contributions and my two big ticket purchases. At my current net worth, this would represent a 1.43% withdrawal rate. I don't plan to spending less money than my FIRE budget of $33,500 - but it shows me that I have a lot of flexibility to adapt IF I absolutely needed to.

# Notable experiences since my last update:

Despite 2020 being a pretty awful year in general, there were a few notable things non-financial experienices/accomplishments that are worth mentioning:

* Became a board member and officer for one of my queer summer camps.
* Participated in virtual queer summer camp and got the ""Golden Unicorn"" (MVP) award!
* Beat Hades and got 49/49 achievements. Highest heat beat is 22.
* Nearly finished our Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 campaign.  Our group of 4 has played S1, S2, and now S0 together and it has been a wonderful shared experience.  I'm glad we could still make playing Pandemic Legacy a reality in a the midst of a IRL Pandemic.
* Visited WDW/US for 10 days total (Pre-Covid) and got to ride Rise of the Resistance... twice. OH MY GOD that ride is AMAZING. It mixes some amazing jaw-dropping visuals, fast paced action, and a tad bit of ""immersive theater"".
* Camped at Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and a few state parks in WA.

# Reflection of 2020 Goals and Forecasting 2021 Goals

2020 Goals

* ~~Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.~~
* ~~Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).~~
* ~~Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).~~
* ~~Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor. I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.~~

As you can see I didn't meet any of my goals for year 2, but that's COVID for ya.  I would still like to do the first three goals at some point (probably not 2021 at this rate) but realized that I no longer would like to do NOLS/Outward bound. So what are my new goals for the upcoming year? I have to temper it given that I am pretty low on the list to get vaccinated and the world is probably going to still be uncertain. The basis of these goals is based on if they can be done solo and/or with people without specific skillsets (hard to find people with the right skills to pod with and have similar risk profiles) and don't require me to be vaccinated (assuming that for the in-person interaction, it will still be masked/socially distanced).

* Continue to serve on my board and find volunteer opportunities for both queer summer camps, hopefully in person at camp.
* Get involved in local youth outdoor activities such as ICO ([https://www.sierraclub.org/ico](https://www.sierraclub.org/ico)), which has more flexibility than something like NOLS/Outward Bound. I'm also hoping to create/lead a rock climbing program for queer POC youth in my area.
* Do more local outdoor activities (climbing, hiking, biking).
* Camp at a few ""local"" National Parks - Death Valley, King's Canyon, Sequoia
* I have the least control on this last one, but as soon as I'm vaccinated I would love to take an international trip by the end of the year, ideally to Brazil or Laos.

983,A Few Graphs about Whether to Invest at All-Time Highs,,772,eh64c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eh64c1/a_few_graphs_about_whether_to_invest_at_alltime/,1577627495.0,"tl;dr - **Don't trust strangers on the Internet to write correct code. AH! I should have been more suspicious when the results didn't come out exactly the way I expected. The upper bound on David's parameter is probably less than 5%, not 15%!** Making new plots now. Sorry about that!

MAJOR EDITS: There was a bug in how I coded up David's strategy, and it made his results much better than they should have been. I discovered it while implementing /u/Bigholebigshovel's suggestion of a modified DCA, where you DCA unless there is a dip, in which case you dump everything in.

I don't know the proper etiquette when a post needs to be changed so much, but has already been up for several hours, with lots of comments. I'm reluctant to delete it, but if the mods want to remove it, I'd be TOTALLY fine with that. If this was a paper I had submitted, I would retract it. But I don't want to retract the discussion in the comments.

Anyway, here's a (probably) correct version of the original post:

~~tl;dr - In a mild surprise to me, waiting to invest new cash when the market is at an all-time high is a perfectly fine strategy.~~

tl;dr2 - h/t /u/HealthCare2FIRE_Blog ""Between dumping and DCA, go with what helps you sleep at night.""

It's a new year on Wednesday, and I bet most of us will be putting $6k into IRAs and investing Thursday morning. Over on r/investing /u/SuperCaptainMan asked the [question](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/egl0a4/given_the_current_rally_will_you_be_contributing/) that is probably on many people's minds: Is it really safe to invest right now given the huge rally in 2019?

As the top comment over there indicates, investing every year on Jan1 (and in general, investing as soon as you have money to invest, regardless of market conditions) is a great strategy. I'm a Schwab fanboy, so I'll link [Schwab's assessment](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/does-market-timing-work) of 5 investment strategies. Obviously Peter Perfect (who always invests at the low point of the year) comes out ahead, but Ashley Action (who invests immediately) almost always comes in second place. Dollar-cost-averaging, like Matthew Monthly, is not much worse than Ashley, and is forced on many of us who get our salary gradually throughout the year instead of all on Jan 1.

Schwab's last two ""strategies"" of Rosie Rotten always investing at the yearly high point and Larry Linger only holding cash don't seem realistic. That is, they are an extreme version of being nervous about Jan1 during a rally, and imo too far to the extreme to be relevant. So I made up a new character for our story, David Dip, who waits for an X% dip off the all-time monthly S&P500 high before investing. If you are comfortable looking at graphs without explanation, [here they are](https://imgur.com/a/V4PzFpQ).

I coded up David's strategy (and the other 5) in Matlab to see how they compare. ~~I'll post code in the comments.~~ I got the data from [ERN's SWR spreadsheet](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/). I didn't do any extra vetting of the dataset, and apparently it's slightly different than what Schwab used, so take this for what it is--casual data visualization by a random stranger on the Internet.

David's strategy is unlike the other 5, because it takes a parameter. How big of a dip does there need to be to invest? I ran every integer percentage value from 0% (which should and does match Ashley exactly) to ~~20%~~ 15% (which is obviously too much, as you'll see). I expected to show that David's strategy is just like Ashley's when the parameter is low, and worse than Ashley's when the parameter is high. ~~What I saw is slightly different than that, but only slightly.~~ Edit: In the buggy code, it looked like the parameter could be as high as 15% and David was still doing fine, even slightly better than Ashley. In the corrected code, I see exactly what I expected. For values <5%, David is just like Ashley. But for values >5%, David is worse, and by 10% or 15%, MUCH worse.

EDIT: In the comments, /u/Bigholebigshovel suggested that I not use Ashley as the baseline, but instead use Matthew Monthly (DCA). So I implemented a ""Shovel"" strategy that does DCA while waiting for a dip. So this looks like David, but Shovel will never hold cash more than 12 months. This turns out to be a very good strategy, assuming I haven't bungled things again.

First, let's replicate Schwab's results to make sure my code is mostly correct:

https://imgur.com/DYQb8wi

Pretty close. My numbers are consistently higher than Schwab's, and I don't know why. Perhaps ERN is reinvesting dividends and Schwab isn't, or something like that. The trend is spot on, so I'm not going to worry about that.

Next, I ran David's and Shovel's strategies over 78 periods of 20 years each. I computed the mean and median normalized return, where ~~Ashley's return (or David with parameter 0%) is set to 1.~~ Matthew's return (or Shovel's with parameter 100%) is set to 1. On average, Ashley does 2% better than Matthew, so you can imagine a horizontal line at 1.02 representing Ashley. David's line starts exactly at Ashley's value. ~~The result shows that David outperforms Ashley by an average of ~1% when the parameter is set perfectly.~~ The result is that while Shovel is fine at any parameter, David is only OK as long as his parameter is very small, <5%.

~~[Not going to link to the old, wrong images, though they are still in the album]~~

https://imgur.com/QtLdI6S

~~Remember, that's 1% over 20 years, meaning a few basis points per year. But actually, I think this result is very encouraging! If psychologically you can't bring yourself to invest during a rally, don't! Just make sure that as soon as there is a dip of 5-10%, you invest. If you only wait for headline-making dips of 15% or more, your returns will suffer.~~ 

I think the right way to interpret this is that if you can't stomach the thought of lump-sum investing on Jan1 when the market is at an all-time high, do DCA instead while you wait for a small dip.  Also, David and Shovel *never* sell stocks once they buy in (and neither did Peter, Ashley, or anyone else). In other words, this strategy only applies to new money.

What market conditions cause David's strategy to be especially bad? Well, a very long rally with no dips, obviously.  Here's one example:

~~[Not going to link to the old wrong images]~~

https://imgur.com/9bmuM0j

~~[I removed a lot of irrelevant commentary here]~~

How about the market conditions where Shovel doesn't do well? Well, to be honest, it looks like random noise to me, and I don't see any trends or patterns that predict when Shovel won't work well. This is a good thing, by the way.

That's all I've got. I made a couple plots of the PDF of David's return, so maybe I'll tidy those up, label them, and add them to the imgur album. I thought this was an interesting and mildly surprising result, so I wanted to share.

Happy (almost) New Year!

984,six months into early retirement,,771,7gutwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7gutwk/six_months_into_early_retirement/,1512133482.0,"**Introduction**: This post is part of an ongoing monthly early-retirement series that will continue indefinitely, provided that the voting reflects the view that it is still seen as relevant to the community. I suppose that this is my way of giving back to a movement that helped me tremendously on my journey. A background summary is offered in the final section and repeated every month. Please check there to find answers to potential questions.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772 with a withdrawal rate of no more than 3% ($30,773 per year in 2017 dollars). I have decided to recalculate a new 3% withdrawal rate maximum value at the end of each year based on the new year-end balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $30k/yr withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not how your holy Trinity works, but since 3% is well within historically safe territory for indefinite portfolio survival, and since our withdrawal rate has actually averaged below 2% thus far due to additional income, we have some flexibility. Side Question: Does this spending model already exist, or am I required to name it as its creator?

**Spending**: Living expenses for the month ($4092) were $1528 over the 2017 monthly targeted amount of $2564. Our spending was 59.5% over budget for the month, now 16.2% over for the year. We generated $792 of income from my wife's part-time fun job at the library and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $3300 this month, thus our pro-rated annual withdrawal rate is 3.66% for the month and 2.19% for the year. Without the additional income stream, our pro-rated annual withdrawal rate would have been 4.79% for the month and 3.49% for the year.

**Investments**: The portfolio went from $1,080,121 to $1,101,683 (a 1.99% increase for the month), which dropped down to a new total of (drum-roll) $1,098,383 after paying the bills. This is a 7.1% increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772, even after withdrawals of $11,601 for living expenses over six months. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full-time employee generating $80.97/hr of labor income. VTSAX (60% AA) went up 3.0% this month; VFWAX (21% AA) went up 0.4%; VWLUX (19% AA) did what it was supposed to do.

**Reflections**: Our investments are once again at an all-time high, smashing the $1.1M mark ($1.5M net worth) yesterday and tempting me once more to ease out of the domestic stock market. Spending was up quite considerably due to xmas shopping (some of which will be reimbursed since the in-laws have this weird tradition of buying your own presents and getting money back), marathon entry, two massages, a spike in charitable giving this past Tuesday, a $300 pair of Nike Zoom Vaporfly 4% shoes, and $1000 in Home Depot charges for the cabin lumber. This was not at all a typical spending month, and finalizing the decision to adjust our withdrawal amounts based on new year-end values makes the spending seem inconsequential (unless the market corrects 10% in December).

**Experiences**: A harmless hillbilly opiate junkie showed up on my porch in a drunken state while I was decorating Walden Cabin. I held him at gunpoint (because I could) with the shotgun until officers arrived. Someone requested a picture of the [cabin](https://imgur.com/a/5hJxx) last month; I do not have any pictures of the junkie. Incidentally, this is the fourth time in seven years that we’ve had to call law enforcement due to trespassing (two intoxicated junkies, one panhandling con-artist, and one drunken hunter) in addition to another complaint against a driver who tried to make us think he was going to run us over while jogging. This is the cost of LCOL in the South. The total bill on the cabin was just under $1000 ($700 PT lumber, $100 shingles, $100 stain, $100 brackets/screws). Someone also asked for a picture of the [house](https://imgur.com/a/WzB6L) we built (seven years old, looks different now). In the discussion section of the previous month, we were talking about the phenomenon of having dreams about forgetting to go to class even though we graduated years ago, and I had one the very next night. Marathon training hit its peak with runs of 20 and 21 miles. I planned two vacations upcoming in 2018 (Middle America and Japan). I played Final Fantasy V (PS1) and read Tale of Genji, but I abandoned both due to a lack of interest. I’m currently playing Chrono Cross (PS1) but don’t know how much further I’ll continue. I renewed our healthcare policy through the exchange and received over $13,000 to pay for subsidies (see below).

**Upcoming**: The full marathon is December 9. My secret lifetime goal made almost five years ago was to run one in under three hours. All of my preparation efforts suggest that 3:01-3:02 is a best case scenario, but we’ll see. If I can manage a sub-three, I’ve considered becoming a volunteer running mentor for people who are just starting. I’ll be spending a lot of time in theaters because good movies are actually released this time of year.  There are two more PS1 games (Xenogears and Dragon Warrior VI) that I would love to play before the end of the year. We’ll be making a trip to the tree nursery and getting a lot of stuff to plant once everything goes dormant in a few days. I have some xmas shopping and tax planning to tackle. I’d like to inactivate my facebook account as well. I’ll also be doing whatever the fuck I want.

**Background**: I am former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors and doctorate before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years, entirely with CVS. $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k), and massive help from my parents ($90k).

I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My model places no dependence upon supplemental income (future employment?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (no heirs), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

Our healthcare premiums are covered entirely by ACA subsidies. I do not care what you think of this. The law requires me to have a policy, and I answered all of the questions on the exchange website honestly. My former employer and I paid over $100,000 for health coverage during my career, and we used less than 5% of that. Insurance in the US is no longer a system of protection against unforeseeable, unpreventable circumstances. If it were, I would refuse the subsidies out of principle. The vast majority of healthcare costs are a direct result of a large portion of the population being self-centered irresponsible gluttons without the discipline to maintain a healthy lifestyle. These same individuals want the most expensive care possible and expect the cost to be spread to everyone else on their policies. I find this to be the equivalent of a mandatory insurance program for homeowners in which a large number of policy holders are pyromaniacs trying to burn their own houses down. I will be attempting to recoup my previous losses on health insurance for as long as the ACA exists.

I am bored to tears with most discussions on SWR, COL, UBI, ACA, SSI, Trinity, insurance, what-if scenarios, financial doomsday preppers, crystal balls, investment strategies, side hustles, lifestyle inflation, market corrections, frugality tips, tax avoidance, my former life as a pharmacist, and even the acronym FIRE. When you’re new to the topic of early retirement, all of that stuff is very exciting. When you’ve run the race and crossed the line, not so much. This is a public forum, and I’ll likely read what you have to say, but please don’t expect much in the way of a response if it’s a question that I or someone else has answered a million times, especially if you’re just offering an unsubstantiated claim about my personal situation that demonstrates willful stupidity. It happens every month. I am however willing to clarify anything and discuss topics that I find to be of more interest. I genuinely appreciate all the congratulations and well-wishers.

985,Do most people plan to retire?,,773,geunbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/geunbh/do_most_people_plan_to_retire/,1588805921.0,"Usually money is one of those taboo topics that just doesn’t get brought up with friends/family, but I posed a question to my friends the other day:  “If you could retire now, what would you do with your time?  Would you volunteer, take on a venture you’re passionate about, take up a hobby, etc”

My friends, who are all career professionals in their late 30’s -early 40’s, surprised me with their answers.  Not a single one had plans to retire, not just today but any day.  One said he had never thought about retirement or what that looks like, two said they didn’t think they’d be able to afford it and two said they couldn’t imagine “not working.”

I get most of us here have a different view of working, but I’m shocked that of 5 people nearing the halfway mark of their career, not one is giving any long term thought about retirement.  And while only two said they didn’t think they’d ever be able to afford it, the cynic in me wonders if the others haven’t thought about it or can’t imagine it because of financial feasibility as well (I just can’t imagine doing a 9-5 until I die).

When I started hearing their responses, I didn’t pursue the discussion further as it was not my intention to make anyone feel bad or uncertain about their financial security but its left me curious (and concerned).  Is it really that rare of a feat to be able to retire in the US?",financialindependence

We made the choice to be quiet about our financial situation because he especially has had family take advantage of him in the past. We aren't mean and do help family members out but we perfer to keep our money situation private.

Because we are minimlist, don't have a fancy car quite a few people around us think we are much poorer and then patronise us and talk down to us about how great they are doing and how we need to work harder even a relative I know is up to her eyes in debt is like this all because we don't drive a flash car or live drapped in designer goods.

993,Forget million-dollar homes: The millennials chasing a different dream.,,764,9g0s3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9g0s3p/forget_milliondollar_homes_the_millennials/,1537010953.0,"They don’t feature in the smashed avocado-laced headlines, and you won’t see them living the high life on Instagram.

And while they may be as equally impacted as other millennials by the high cost of capital city housing, they’re not succumbing to the (understandably) crushing fear that they may never own a house in a trendy suburb.
And, sorry Generation X, but they intend to retire before you do, too.
They’re the group of young Australians who self-identify their financial circumstances and plans by the acronym FIRE -- Financial Independence, Retire Early.

Yes, the full phrase is a little clunky, but that’s not stopping them. And they intend to have the last laugh.

FIRE enthusiasts, if you can call them that, are a small but vibrant community of twenty- and thirty-something Australians (and their overseas cousins) who are committed to achieving financial independence as soon as possible, with the goal of retiring from work -- or at least having the freedom to choose to -- decades earlier than their parents and grandparents did.

**Work hard, live frugally, save aggressively**

Refreshingly, these aren’t the ‘How I bought 108 properties by 23’ crowd. There’s little-to-no financial engineering and not much -- if any -- debt. Instead, the FIRE crowd is taking a leaf out of the book written by the Boomers’ parents: work hard, live frugally, and save aggressively.


And it feels like the movement is growing. What’s perhaps most stark about this movement is that it’s a neat, if uncomfortable, counterpoint to the generally accepted view of the hopelessness of the financial challenges faced by millennials. Not that those challenges aren’t real -- it’s just that those following a FIRE philosophy are making hard choices to take control of their financial futures.


Talking to a couple of investors, Tristan and David, who are pursuing a FIRE strategy, a couple of themes kept recurring.
According to Tristan, “The idea of working to 65, commuting two hours a day and not being able to access retirement money until we were old didn't sound too fun. We liked the idea of being in charge of life by being financially independent enough to do what we wanted.”
Dave agreed: “I was motivated by the thought of having to work my whole life in a job I didn't like. Or just for the money to pay bills, while having no control over how I spend my time.
""Looking around and talking with other people in the workplace and society in general, they didn't seem all that happy about it and just seemed to accept it. Doing the same unsatisfying thing with no end in sight. I quickly decided that wasn't ok for me and there had to be another way.”


FIRE-followers are often the ones moving out of the big cities, or at least to less expensive parts of them. They’re eating at home, rather than going out (the data are fuzzy on the at-home consumption of avocados), and they don’t drive new cars or travel.
“It's really about finding a happy life for you, that doesn't consume your entire income, because that's going to get you nowhere”, according to David, while Tristan identified some of the lifestyle adjustments, including what you do and buy and how you travel:
“Spending significantly less than you earn is tough if it means (probably) renting on the outskirts of the city, solely using public transport, mostly eating Aldi-bought food and so on. It's an extreme version of long-term patience reaches the goal, which doesn't suit some people.”


When I asked them what advice they’d give people considering the move, David summarised the numbers nicely: “The amount you need to save and invest is directly in line with how much you spend. Put another way, the less you spend, the less investments you need to support that spending, and the faster you'll become financially independent.”

Tristan agreed, adding that being part of a community helps. “Find people on the internet who have already achieved FIRE, or are on the way to achieving it, to see how they're doing it.”


**Foolish takeaway**

Foregoing consumption today allows FIRE followers to achieve financial independence earlier, thanks to the miracle of compounding. And there’s a real freedom from mastering your consumption and taking control of your financial life.
But it does require sacrifice. It’s a lifestyle that’s not for everyone, but for those who embrace it, the rewards are early retirement and, yes, financial independence.

This NYT article seems aimed at showing the range of middle class incomes and how seemingly minor things can make a normal life feel impossible.  I pulled in all the numbers from the article (some were combined so comparisons could be made between families). A few things jump out quickly.  In terms of expenses:

 * ~~Savings rates are painfully low (0-30%)~~. **SEE EDIT BELOW**
 * Rent is 15-35% of take-home pay for all families; you might get paid more in a big city, but home costs reflect that
 * Financing more car(s) than you can afford can ruin you.  F1 and F2 spent 12% and 17% on transportation alone!
 * It is critical to understand that DEBT IS AN EMERGENCY.  F3 has 768 in left over cash, but has a 340 cc debt payment
 * Kids are insanely expensive until they are in public school. F2, F3 and F4 spent 25%, 33% and 18% of their takehome on kids
 * Your cellphone bill barely matters
 * Only F4 is saving for retirement seriously
 * Few are taking full advantage of the tax benefits available to them (FSA, Dependent Care FSA, Retirement Savings).  F2 could fully cover their student loans with the tax savings from a Dependent Care FSA.

None of this is particularly surprising, especially in an article designed to make a point, but it seems like each family has a major thing they can fix:

 * F1: Debt consolidation and pay off that CC debt ASAP.  That, and they need to get on some kind of health insurance ASAP, since that is a ticking time bomb.
 * F2: Change their car situation drastically.  $1000/month on vehicles is insane.
 * F3: 2800 for childcare for 1 kid, Holy shit.  They can save a bit on this through Dependent Care FSA (pre-tax childcare savings) or other [CA state incentives](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/child-and-dependent-care-expenses-credit.html).  
 * F4: They are doing well but could definitely crank up savings and their use of tax-advantaged accounts.

**EDIT: Since people are complaining about me being too harsh with my language around savings rate, I added a couple more rows.**  

SR is total savings rate (Retirement, savings, F4 extra mortgage and ""remaining"") divided by total income (takehome, pretax costs).  Intentional SR is the same but without the ""remaining"" amount; I assume that that flex in their budget isn't well-organized.  The intentional SR for F1, F2, F3 is <10% which I think is painfully low.  F4 is saving 20% intentionally but I think they can do better.  The point of this was not to cast judgment on these people but more to highlight how little people value savings as an end unto itself.  If this sub has taught me anything, it's that you need to protect what you have when you have it, because another recession could be just around the corner.

I think everyone on this sub gunning for FIRE are smarter than average and realize that these bloggers have supplemented their incomes with blogging. How much is the question? I've also seen many people that were genuinely curious at the detailed breakdown of blogging. Whether this is because it's been your childhood dream to blog about something you're passionate about, or you think it is your way to salvation to your FIRE dreams (it's probably not), i think there are many people that want to know how much bloggers make and hopefully this post helps.

Most of these bloggers hit their FI numbers long before they really started making money from their blogs but nonetheless, they are earning passive incomes from writing online. How much this amount is rarely shared and i think people speculate wildly and of course some bloggers are much more successful than others. I've also seen many people on this sub keen on how people started up blogs and how they've managed to monetize their blogs. As someone that is almost FIREd, here is a rundown on my website and how much I made in 2019. This post will be a summary but if you want the detailed breakdown with charts and stuff, you can visit my page (link at bottom of post)

It's not easy to make money from blogging so please don't think because I created something that generates money, it is an easy move for you. I wanted to shed some light on the subject and I know plenty of people here are keen to create a blog of some sort before or after FIRE so hopefully this will help or inspire!

&#x200B;

**Blogging is not factored into my FIRE #**

Full disclosure, I am almost at FIRE (probably in the next year or two) but it is completely separate from my blogging activities. I work a full time job (Earning 200k+) and the blog was merely a hobby started many years ago and only recently started to generate noticeable amounts of money. I don't count the blogging income into my SWR as it is still a relatively new profession and past success does not guarantee future returns. When I FIRE, my SWR will be purely from my investments.

Nevertheless, it is something i truly enjoy doing and whether I FIRE with $1m, or $10m, I would continue to blog regardless. The extra cash is just a nice perk on the side. I'll use the extra cash for fun spending money, reinvesting in the markets or taking punts on single name stocks. Who knows?

&#x200B;

**What is my blog about?**

My blog is not really related to the topic of FIRE but rather a travel blog. I guess these things kind of go hand in hand like Gocurrycracker. I started it when i was living abroad many years ago to document my experiences and just kept writing stuff over the years about places I've traveled to. I've also written a bunch of posts about how I take advantage of US credit cards and fully engage in hustling the crap out of them for travel benefits. I've not written much in the sense of FIRE besides making a spreadsheet tracking Net Worth (which you can find if you google ""Net Worth Spreadsheet"", it should be one of the top 5 results).

So in summary, it is a blog about 5 years old that is about travel. Blogging takes a lot of work if you actually want to monetize it. I feel lilke people here think ""oh they're a blogger so they must make lots of money"". It couldn't be further from the truth. Sure there are plenty of bloggers that do make money but the vast majority never do. It takes a long time to write quality content, consistently while at the same time optimizing your SEO. Nowadays, it's very easy to make a blog look nice because of all the premium themes out there but it can't make up for quality content which takes a long time to write. I've written about 250 posts and each post is somewhere between 2000-3000 words. This means I've written almost a million words and who knows how many pictures.

I never had the intention of making money in the beginning because I enver thought it would become anything. However, the money generated is just a nice affirmation that you have created a product on all your own that is ""worth"" something. It's a nice feeling to get compensated for something you enjoy.

&#x200B;

**How much traffic do i get?**

Traffic is of course wildly important for generating income on a blog. It's pretty linearly correlated; the more traffic you get, the more money you can earn. In 2019, my traffic increased significantly as the year went on so saying what the average over the year is not so accurate. So i'll use the last quarter's traffic as this is a better indicator for future traffic. This is not to say my traffic won't decrease because of certain factors, but it would also increase too.

For q4 of 2019, I had roughly **1,500** unique visitors a day and roughly **2,200 page views** per day. This translates to 50,000 unique visitors a month and 70,000 pageviews a month. With this amount of traffic, you can start earning some cash. As of the beginning of 2020, I have been getting almost 2000 unique views so hopefully it keeps growing.

**How do I earn money from blogging?**

Before I write a single word, let's preface it by saying EVERYONE has different ways of making money. How I mak emoney is not how another blogger would. There are probably much better ways to monetize that I've not been exposed to but this is merely how I made the amount of money i did for 2019.

* **Advertisements: S**elf explanatory. Running ads through Google Adsense and Ezoic, which is an ad optimization service that has really beefed up my ad revenue. This is probably the easiest way to make money if you have enough traffic because you just set it and forget it. Of course, running too many ads (which I probably do) reduces the readership experience and likely to increase your bounce rate (percentage of people that leave your website reading only one page). Nevertheless, I'm still relatively new at this so will adjust this accordingly.
* **Sponsorships:** This is probably how the big bloggers make most of their money. They don't need to run ads anymore because they have such a big following that big companies will pay said blogger to advertise a specific product. I get some of these from small travel agents. I also post sponsored post which is a post I may write about a specific travel topic and I'm linking it to another company that then pays me for said post.
* **Affiliate Programs:** I use booking.com as my affiliate program. When someone clicks a link that I have on my blog with my affiliate ID, makes a booking, I get a percentage of that booking. Other people use Amazon affiliates where they can link to a product on Amazon and if they reader buys it, they get a percentage commission. These are great for people running fashion blogs, tech reviews, etc. but I just never really got into this.
* **Social Media:** Everyone probably knows about those people making crazy money on Instagram these days. That is not me. I enjoy social media but could never be bothered to really build it up. I make no money from Social Media but i know many travel bloggers that make a killing. Youtube is also another huge revenue generator for some people but just never something I've invested enough time into.
* **Bespoke products:** This is just certain services and products you offer your readers. This can be things like selling e-book, photography services, social media management, e-courses etc. For me, this is travel planning. i've planned out numerous honeymoons to Africa in the past year. I've not charged anything for it but just asked the couples to book their accommodations using booking.com which then i generate commission (see bullet above). I plan to start charging a nominal fee for this in the future.

&#x200B;

**How much did I earn in 2019?**

So now that you know how I made money on blogging, this is how much I made:

Advertisements: **$5,500**

Sponsorships: **$3,500**

Affiliate Programs: **$3,000**

Expenses: **($100)** \- This is primarily costs from hosting and a few premium Wordpress plugins.

Total 2019 Profit: **$12,000**

If you want a detailed breakdown of that number with charts,you'll have to go to my blog. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Projections for 2020**

2020 is looking good. Ever since I moved to Europe for work, there's been lots to write about and i've seen a pretty solid growth of traffic in 2019 that was probably more SEO related than content, but nonetheless I hope that trend carries forward into 2020. If i extrapolate my q4 2019 to 2020, I should hopefully make around $16,000-$18,000 or more in 2020. Let's see what time brings!

&#x200B;

**How much do the big guys make?**

So there you have it. How much I made in 2019 from a blog that you'll never have read before. So someone writing about financial products like FIRE bloggers with the type of traffic that gets sent their way by the press, reddit etc, it is easy to estimate they could make well into the 6 figures for blogging. Of course, not everyone is MMM. He was first to market and really capitalized well on the movement in the beginning. He is an outlier along with many of the other FIRE bloggers. While I will never make 6 figures blogging, I am totally content with growing my little mini presence online and making a few bucks doing it.",financialindependence

Single income earner with 2 kids. My salary for the first 10 years was in between 50K to 80k. I read about FI around 8 years back and realized my salary was not enough to become FI. I completely focussed my attention on getting job that paid well. Luckily I was working in IT so it was easier to find ways to make more money including technology and companies to target.
I started studying and practicing for interview in December 2012. In February 2013, I found my dream job paying me 130K for a big 5 consulting firm. I stayed in the company for a year, all the while continuing to practice and study. In 2014, I landed another job for 170k. I was happy but I knew I could do better. So, continued study and found my next job for 200k in 2016.
I hate my job but funny thing is I hated my job even when I was making 50K. So for the greater good of getting to FIRE, my plan is to continue working for the next 3-5 years and then FIRE with $2M. I blame myself for not saving enough in the first 10 years but better late than never.
Thanks for listening. I do not have anyone else whom I can share this so sharing here. 


My expense is currently around $6000/month( varied from $2500 to $6000), invest everything else in VTSAX. Also started investing in AAPL since 2014.

2000 - 2012 : Salary between 50k to 80k

2013 - 130k 

2014 - 170k

2015 - 185K

2016 - 200k

2017 - 200K

2018 - 200k

2019 - 200k


I am currently at $1.3M. I know a lot can change in the next 3-5 years including I can loose my job, obamacare repeal, I can get burnt out etc etc..I will change my plan and even my location when that happens.

FYI, this is my first post, please forgive my english. I hate writing just like my job :). I know my salary is higher than most others folks but please do not treat this as bragging post. I do not think I have done enough to brag. I am really a nobody and have nothing to brag. I still am only 60% of my target, rent my apartment and drive an old corolla, nothing to brag. I hope someone finds my increase in income inspirational and tries something similar.

Edit1: my expense varied from $2500(single with no kids) to $6000(married with 2 kids). And no, I do not have any crypto and never received any inheritance. Its all hard work and saving.

Edit2: In one of my humble days, I promised myself that I will help at least 1500 people. I am not there yet to provide monetory help but would love to help provide guidance to anyone who is trying to increase his salary. Remember, if a lazy bum and a job hater like me can do it, anyone else can do it. Even if you are not in IT, research based on your education and experience, what job pays well and then go all out. Think and work on it night and day and you will succeed.

Edit3: I have not stopped trying to increase my salary more. My next target is $250K to $300K. If all goes well and I can motivate myself, I will get there by March of next year.

Edit4: I have been a good saver my whole life even when I was making $50k. But of course, when I look back I think I could have saved more and invested. Thanks to my Parents who taught me how to live a happy life with modest income.

Edit5: All of you who reached out to me for suggestion via DM, I promise I will respond to each one of you. My purpose in life is to retire and then spend my life helping other fellow human beings. Thank you for reaching out.",financialindependence

Previous post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7ak6w3/fire\_with\_autistic\_child/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7ak6w3/fire_with_autistic_child/)

Here is our update:

* We ended up moving to California.  I can honestly say the move was one of the most stressful and difficult things we have done but we felt like it was the right thing for our situation.  I took and passing the bar.  I really enjoy my new job and now make $175K, which is much higher than my prior salary (though the COL is also much higher).
* We lived with my in-laws while we figured out what we were doing with our lives.  Not something I thought I'd ever do in my 30's, but it was a necessity for our situation.  Sometimes swallowing your pride is necessary.
* We were able to rent our old place and buy a new place in CA.  The net effect is that we ended up with an additional rental, which has juiced our savings and FIRE journey.  
* We are THRILLED with the services our daughter is getting.  She is able to participate in programs which either don't exist in smaller communities or else are not covered by insurance.  The level and affordability of care is VERY different from place to place, and we're so happy we decided to move to a place where we could get good care at a price we can afford.  
* We just crossed $500K NW, which is much sooner than we thought we would get there.  This is a combination of converting our old house to a rental, living with in-laws, and the general rise in real estate/stocks.

And it comes out the company has offered both of us a neat early retirement package. Although we don't need it, it looks like a good exit point.

I told her that we have more than enough -our current yearly expenses are 1.5% of our savings-, but she is a cautious person. She was leaning towards having one of us continue working. 

So we went to check with a financial adviser. He put the numbers in the magic program that gave us a 99% chance of having enough money, even doubling the expenses. I was not very surprised. My wife reaction was: ""I retire, you do whatever you want"".

I'm a little torn myself. Thanks to financial independence my job has become more comfortable because I work on my terms, and I have chosen some interesting assignments because I could take risks. On the other hand it looks like my job could disappear soon, and a few years of work will make no difference on the quality of the rest of my life.

We want to find some other jobs though, which at 50 years old will not be easy. We will see.

* ""I make money, but it's not what I love.""

I recently stumbled on the graph below and it definitely explains a lot of these feelings and puts it into context.

This site has the [Venn diagram](http://www.performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/finding-lifes-meaning-quest-discover-ikigai-pen-august-2017/). 

* What you love is either a ***mission*** or a ***passion***.

* What you are good at is either a ***passion*** or a ***profession***.

* What you can be paid for is either a ***profession*** or a ***vocation***.

* What the world needs is either a ***vocation*** or a ***mission***.

* What you love & what the world needs is a ***mission***.

* What you love & what you are good at is a ***passion***.

We all strive for ***ikigai***, but most will not find it. However, if you find a **vocation** or **profession** during your years working for financial independence, then you can focus on either a **passion** or **mission**, since you do not need anyone to pay for it. Effectively, you have created your own ***ikigai***, over a lifetime, rather than simultaneously.

If you had a *profession* during your earning years, you will likely be searching for a *mission* later. If you had a *vocation* during your earning years, you will likely search for a *passion* later.

As a CPA (working in finance), I'm squarely in the *profession* category. The world doesn't, really, need us, I'm good at it, I get paid for it. I do love parts of it. There are days when I *feel*, ""satisfaction, but a feeling of uselessness"" on the days I love it. Other days, I *feel*, ""comfortable, but a feeling of emptiness"" when I'm doing work the world needs, but I don't love. Therefore, I'm constantly searching for a mission. I know what I want to do post-career, that will negate these feelings.

I can't speak to the software engineers here, but I imagine, you're in the section between profession & vocation in terms of feelings. Depending on where you work, you may even be between the mission & vocation. Therefore, you're likely searching for the passion, post-career.

Hopefully, this idea, and chart, can help people answer this question on the sidebar:

>Discovering and achieving life goals: “What would I do with my life if I didn't have to work for money?""

I believe it also speaks to this portion of the sidebar:

I really admire those of you that can track every dime you earned or spent for the last 15 years. Some of you talk about 3.x percent as your SWR. Close examination of fine details is not my personality, nor how I live my life. I am more of a big picture person, and I am comfortable with unknowns.  Before I FIRE'd, I tracked expenses and net worth and aimed for na 4% SWR.  But my calculus was back of the napkin compared to you all that have years of spreadsheets.

So what got me to close on retiring from my career (9 years of training, 18 years in practice)? Pulling the trigger and retiring is not easy. It is always going to be a leap of faith. I think folks here convince themselves that there is little or no risk by having the bullet proof safe withdrawal rate, but there is always risk.  

For me, I had zero ambivalence about quitting my career.  It was 100% the right thing for me - I was going to die younger if I kept sitting in a chair and I am very passionate about living my best life. My SO and I were on the same page about the plan we had together. Finally, I got comfortable with my loosey-goosey back of the napkin FIRE math by building a side hustle and demonstrating to myself that part-time, I could earn as much as I would ever need in a worse case scenario. 

Now I am FIRE'd for the last 18 & 1/2 months. I just got a 1099 from PayPal indicating that last year I grossed ~$50k in my part time side hustle (about 40k net). I am taking a month away to explore Japan - one of the few bucket items I have had since my early 20's. 

I am really glad I retired and did not let the uncertainty of that decision force me into additional years of career work. I love putting in the time trying to live my best life, instead of selling my time to a job. I hope this doesn't come off braggy, I don't mean it to. Rather, I just want to let others that are like me know that you can FIRE imperfectly and still be OK.

That's exactly how I feel. The problem is I'm in my early 30s.

Now on the FIRE path I'm doing pretty good. I'm in a LCOL part of Europe, have been working since 16 and now work in tech, so if I stick with what I'm doing for another 15-20 years I should be golden. I really don't know if I can though.

So I'm wondering if anyone has made a big career switch while pursuing fire. I know of barristaFIRE, but that's not really what I mean. If I switch I'd probably need to work longer (I'm in tech now, so it would probably be a big paycut), so I would want to do something I really enjoy that makes me happy.

1009,What's Your Biggest Financial Regret/Mistake?,,751,9etqkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9etqkp/whats_your_biggest_financial_regretmistake/,1536634632.0,"I've been thinking about FIRE a lot lately. I'm a little late to the game though, and I fear that one enormous financial mistake in my past will keep me from actually retiring early.

I got a 6-figure job right out of college. I started renting an apartment almost immediately. It wasn't that expensive for me, which was great because I was putting a ton of extra money into my student loans every month. However, my mother as well as my coworkers kept telling me how I was throwing away money on rent.

Finally, I caved and decided to buy a condo. I bought right at the peak of the market. Even worse, I put $50k worth of renovations into it. I honestly thought I'd be living there for a long time. I was single. I figured that if I met someone, they'd move into my place. That's how I justified the expense of the renovations.

Life doesn't always go as planned. Three months after moving into my condo, I met the woman I would later marry. Of course, she was living and working 70 miles away. After 2 years we got engaged, and I found myself in the position where if we were going to have a life together, one of us had to move. I could easily transfer my job to where she was living, but she couldn't do the same. Therefore, I put the condo on the market less than 3 years after buying it.

Long story short... I took a beating on it. The market for condos in the area crashed. I ended up selling for $43k less than purchase price. When you throw in the $50k worth of renovations and include things like condo fees and property taxes, I ended up blowing $100,000 on the stupid condo.

$100,000... poof. 

Thanks to my salary, I was able to build my savings back up. However, I can't stop thinking about how much better my financial situation would be if I had that money. Think about how much compounded interest I missed out on.

I've been through a divorce and being destitute several times (not the divorce part)  after leaving home young.  I grew up in the 80s and 90s middle to upper middle class.

  I am trying to return to a middle class lifestyle and retire early.  Basically I plan to r/leanfire without an rv. I estimate I need about 300k to retire on the lifestyle I want. Maybe less. I'm hoping to retire by about 45. I can keep working if I want as I love what I do.  I purchased (financed) a house this year with money I saved up over a 3 year period.

Anyway, I've been plugging away at this since just past 30. Basically the moment I learned this was a life option I jumped on it.   My SO while he's made steps in the right direction and I'm proud of him. Is financially in his infancy and has only made the changes due to years of prodding . He Doesn't seem like he's going to come around to this whole financial thing.

I've already made clear that we can stay together but I will not marry him with his finances like this and that I will not combine finances or credit with him.  I gave him the opportunity to go halvsies on the DP for the house to make it truly ""ours"" and he came up with $0. Literally.  So it's in my name only.

 He complains that he doesn't make enough and never has money left over.  We split the bills (he reliably pays) and he makes about 10k a year more than me. I put about 50% of my income away and he has none left. I don't see hoards of items or anything. I've tried figuring it out but I think it's all going to man toys and tools and food.  He's also paying some of these things off via credit. Its not a huge amount, I think a couple grand but at our income level that a lot and the interest rate I'm sure is insane.

I've tried talking to him about saving money and not paying interest and he agrees he should but he insists it's a ""I don't make enough money"" thing when I can show him it's clearly a lifestyle choice.  He feels deprived just thinking about not buying stuff. He shops when he's depressed or bored. Its gotten better but it's still there.

Has anyone been in this situation? What happened?  He pays his share, and is a great companion but I'm concerned as to what happens with our increasing gap in wealth. I'm not planning on traveling the world or anything like that once retired but maybe I'm not thinking of something. 

Please, I ask not to bash him unfairly in replies. Hes a good person but he's stuck in a bad place. We align on most other things. 

 I am fully aware he is not going to change and I'm just looking for stories of others in similar situations.


I can clarify things if needed. I wanted to keep the original post short.  Thanks

EDIT:  it looks like people have used this thread to attempt to pick apart my financial plan. I'm on mobile and people are not reading my previous replies so I'm going to put this here once and stop replying to posts

Yes I understand that is about 15k a year once the house is paid off. YES i can live on that including repairs, cars and medical. I will continue to work part time to maintain my medical if needed. I can rent out rooms if things get stupid. I know how to flip things and can come up with money quickly if needed. 


I live a very frugal and resourceful lifestyle and lived on 8K while saving for the house. In southern California.  While I was living in Orange county...

 Thanks for the concern but I am done explaining myself that not what this thread is about. People on reddit said I'd never have a house EVER 3 years ago when I posted my plan and income and look how that turned out. So again thank you but I'm confident I can pull this off.

Check out r/leanfire guys. I'm not the only one who is doing it this way.

Edit2:  I'm going to push for counseling and use some of the other tips you all have kindly shared. I'm still interested in hearing personal experiences though. That's the reason I started this thread. To hear your story on this. Thanks everyone for sharing


and because people asked for how I did it. Here ya go.

1011,Saving for its own sake,,754,jai66i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jai66i/saving_for_its_own_sake/,1602610331.0,"Over the weekend I finished Morgan Housel's new book, *The Psychology of Money.* There were several great chapters, but I think the point that I've thought the most about since, is Housel's beliefs on saving.

Morgan Housel says in the book that he saves a higher portion of his net worth (I think it was 20%) than most people his age (30s). In the chapter about saving, he talked about the fact that most people see saving as a task unto a specific expected purchase: a down payment, a car, etc. He argues that saving is good enough on its own merit -- doesn't require a specific goal -- because having a large liquid net worth gives you more protection and options.

I really liked this way of thinking. It sounded so familiar to everything I hear about financial independence that I thought it might spur a good conversation here. Is 20% of your net worth too much to keep liquid? What do you think of the idea of saving for its own sake, as opposed to always having a ""job"" for every dollar?  


**EDIT:** Really enjoying everyone's responses. I thought I'd clear up some confusion. **First**, it's a great book and this was just one chapter that I was unsure about. But I recommend the book overall and really love Housel's work.  


**Second**, I realize my language was a little confusing in how I described ""saving."" What I meant to say: Housel talks in the book about keeping 20% of his net worth in a savings account. ",financialindependence

So I am 55 and have achieved all my goals towards FI. We are debt free with a net worth of over $2.2M. About half of that in stocks, a quarter in cash and laddered CDs, and a quarter in real estate investments and properties.  It is just my wife and I now and we have been tracking our expenses over the last couple of years. We can easily continue our present lifestyle on $35,000 per year, $30,000 if we cut back on some unnecessary expenses. We live simply and we raise much of our own food and I could do even more if I didn't have to work.  I have structured our finances to where we could weather just about any downturn in the markets. Even without social security we are well under a 2% drawdown rate and that doesn't include any of the passive income from the real estate. We are, as my dad would say, ""Shitting in high cotton.""

I have worked hard to get ourselves to this point where I could retire and focus on other things.  I am ready.  The problem?  I have realized that **I am a fucking coward.** I am *terrified* of taking that final step into retirement. Leaving my job would be a one-way trip. I have a good job that pays well, but it is a young man's game now and the only reason I am still here is because of my reputation for what I have done in the past. I could never come back into this field at the same level I am at.  I enjoy what I do for a living, but I am getting tired of the politics and trying to keep up with the new technologies. Much of what I know is outdated and will probably be totally obsolete in 5 years. My choices are to work even harder to catch up or walk away and do something more rewarding.  *Everything* is telling me that it is time to retire and focus on the things I want to do but I just can't seem to take that step. Whenever I think I have built up the courage to walk away, I hesitate and think of every single thing that could go wrong and slink away again with my tail between my legs.

I'm not even sure what I am afraid of to be honest. Fear of the unknown, I suppose. Fear of watching the numbers possibly start to go down instead of up. Fear of not being able to afford healthcare. Fear of having an ""oh shit"" moment where I realize that in spite of all of my planning I missed something important. I plan *everything* because I don't like surprises. I like predictability, and I suppose this is a leap of faith that all of my planning is good enough. But is it? What if I missed something? Even now the thought of retirement give me a sinking feeling in my stomach. Why, dammit, why?  Because when it comes down to it, I am a coward.

Sorry for the long boring post. This is screaming r/humblebrag I know. I don't mean for it to be. I am like a nervous bride having second thoughts just before walking down the aisle. I've done all of this planning, but have I done *enough*?  How do I get past this fear?  How do I learn to have faith that I have done things correctly?

How can I not be such a **fucking coward**?

Edit: All of you are **awesome**, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. This mass group therapy session has really helped me to see what the problem is, and it wasn't what I thought it was. I'm not afraid of running out of money. I'm afraid of losing an identity that I have spent decades building. I can already feel the fear dissipating as I come to grips with that. I have some deep thoughts to think on for the next month or so as I map out what post-retirement me looks like and how I, as someone put so eloquently, write the story that I want to become.",financialindependence

Many of us talk about taking time off and striving to spend when retired, but it seems there are pockets of millennials who would rather do a long sabbatical while they are young since they feel resigned to work until their 60s or 70s anyways. Another common theme seems to be workers who leave careers without anything lined up due to anxiety/stress or an emptiness in their work.

1014,Has your viewpoint of your own financial independence changed by traveling to third world countries and seeing incredible poverty?,,750,8y23fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8y23fv/has_your_viewpoint_of_your_own_financial/,1531333574.0,"After I inherited lots of money and combined it with my savings and investments from 25 years of putting money away, I looked at my bank and brokerage accounts and became very philosophical.

I decided I wanted to see the world, and specifically third world countries.  (Also called developing countries).  Yes, I had traveled before, but mostly to Europe and resort destinations. This time my wife and I took off on a round the world two month adventure.  We wanted to see how people lived in places where surviving was a day to day challenge. We expected that while we could not save the world- it would give us a perspective on poverty and charity.

What an experience!  We saw places of incredible beauty but also incredible ugly scenes.  We interacted with lots of desperate people who lived day to day. We saw hillsides of shantytowns and smelled unbelievable filth. Everyone we talked to wanted to move to America so they can become millionaires.

We returned home wondering why God allowed us to live in wealth when most of the world lives in poverty.

I don't know if this experience will encourage us to try to be better investors with our money or just accept what we have.

How has exposure to poverty impacted your view of your own financial independence?

(Added after reading the 333 replies to date:  I find a few things really interesting in peoples comments so far:

1)  People try to link the poverty in America to the poverty in Third Word Countries:  OMG!  There is no comparison.

2)  Lots of posters tell us that because of love and family in the third world countries even the poorest people seem happy.  Maybe true, but maybe the satisfaction many people in those countries have even though they are extremely poor is the reason they will stay poor forever. 

3) Many posters say that after seeing poverty overseas, they have cut down on materialistic spending.  Sounds good in theory, but it is the spending on things Americans really don't need that keeps many factory workers overseas alive another day.)",financialindependence

If you are doing well financially, be careful about evangelizing to or dispensing advice to people around you. I think there can be a tendency to assume that if you’re killing it financially, you must be the only one who is, or you’re the most advanced one, and everyone else just fell off the turnip truck. I think there’s even a tendency when you’re financially successful to assume that you have the best recommendations/advice to give about other topics as well (like consumer goods, relationships, travel, diet, etc.).

SO and I are almost certainly on equal financial footing to this other couple we know, but we don’t have any visible markers of success like they do (e.g., homeownership). I wouldn’t say they talk down to us necessarily, but they definitely give unsolicited advice and offer us help a lot, and it’s really awkward. It just rubs me the wrong way and I hope you all (and myself) never behave this way.

I've been waiting to post [this](https://imgur.com/a/BpKE9) since late last year. The truth is, depending on how you cut it, I hit this milestone quite a while ago. I wanted to be stingy with the way I calculated my net worth. By that I mean:

 * I calculated the net worth of my investment property based on how much I have if I sold it (after mortgage, realtor fees and sales cost, recaptured depreciation, and taxes.
 * I didn't include vehicles
 * I didn't include money that was/is owed to me

**Balance Sheet**
I currently hold a HUGE cash position. My assets are roughly broken out like this:

 * $360k cash
 * $20k in Lending Club
 * $400k various stocks using diversity through obfuscation strategy
 * $250k real estate investment

These are all super rough estimates. On a related note, unlike a lot of people here, I don't track much. I just generally try to follow the strategy of only buying things that add value to my life.

I have about $10k in credit card debt (basically, all my monthly expenses) and ~$30k in mortgage debt @ 4% to 4.5%.

**How I feel**
I am very proud of my accomplishments. I worked persistently over two decades to get where I am. Financially I'm miles ahead of almost everyone I know who had even a remotely similar background. I wasn't taught to be financially savvy by my parents and got a lot less financial support than many people. 
 The largest financial help I had was a scholarship that paid my full tuition but not room/board (which is huge, no doubt!). Bottom line - I worked hard and it paid off.

On the other hand, we're in a huge bubble, damn near everyone is a millionaire these days. My original goal (though I use the word goal loosely) was to not be working at all by now. Being a millionaire doesn't mean what it meant when I was a kid. I can't quit my job that I'm not passionate about. It's not even realistic to move to part time. That's not to discount the things it does afford me - I can go back to school or find a new career with less focus on money. I don't worry about making any financial commitments. It would not destroy my life or credit if I quit my job today.

**Oopsie Daisy**
By far the biggest financial mistake I've made is holding onto cash rather than investing in the market or real estate. You could make a strong argument that I continue to make the very same huge mistake documented in my last sentence, though the market seems to have completely disconnected from reality based on the ridiculous amount of free money pumped into the economy. It was really eye opening reading this sub when the market dropped 10% and people were like _I'm so committed I didn't even sell everything and freak out._ and it reminded me that many people, even in this sub have never experienced a legit recession or even market downturn. That's crazy. Keep in mind, I'm not giving advice here - just noting my thoughts. If someone else posted this, I'd probably tell them to just dump it in the market. Funny how that works...

**Goals**
I plan to move out of my current profession (surprise, it's software) to start a business or a new career. The focus will be on learning new things, finding new perspectives, and trying to be more of a ""Renaissance man"". Maybe I'll be a plumber or CFP.

This accidentally got long.

**Edit:** I'm almost 40. Thanks for your perspective and encouragement. I'm double checking with my accountant, but once he gives the green light, I'll pay off the mortgage.",financialindependence
1019,Two Months Into FIRE,,746,6qwp5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6qwp5d/two_months_into_fire/,1501598898.0,"I've decided to continue the monthly updates for now because they help me mentally sort things out, provided that the are still seen as relevant to the subreddit.

Two months into retirement at 38 with a planned 3% SWR on a starting value of 1,025,772. That works out to 2564/month, or 2064/month with $6000 yearly in lump expenses. (2k vacation, 1k property tax, 500 professional license tax, 500 christmas, 500 car insurance summer, 500 car insurance winter, 1k unexpected)

This month's spending was $2640 (up from $2352), including $500 from the yearly column for ""summer car insurance."" So we're 3% over budget for the month, but 3% under for the year. We brought in $1127 thru my wife's job (which she likes and would do for free) and some old book royalties of mine. Our withdrawal was $1513 this month, which is effectively a 1.74% pro-rated SWR (1.46% pro-rated SWR average this year).

The portfolio appreciated again this month from 1,039,471 to 1,056,090 (a 1.60% increase), which dropped back down to a new total of (drum-roll) 1,054,577 after paying the bills (2.8% increase in two months, after expenses). If the year-end value is higher than the starting value, I might recalculate a new 3% SWR value and go forward from there since 3% is in historically safe territory. Or I might reset the clock at the end of the year and set aside everything over one million as a separate fund to draw from without guilt, while maintaining a 3% 30k withdrawal goal.

Spending was a lot higher this month, and I can't really see a good reason, but I'm not too concerned given that I don't have enough data yet and that the market is doing well. I don't budget per se, just monitor. Accomplishments for the month include more reading (especially paleontology and astronomy), more housework, more yardwork, more cooking, more running (now up to 25 mpw with a goal of a 1:25 HM in Oct and 3:00 FM in Dec), more weightlifting, completing the vast majority of my CE requirements for my profession, faster Rubik's cube solves, seeking out volunteer opportunities, learning to play the taishokoto, continued daily journal, visiting old places from my childhood that I had not seen in thirty years, first ever river kayaking, first ever barbecue as the grillmaster, doing my first painting (the startup supplies for this were expensive now that I think about it), and planning upcoming vacations. On the downside, I played way too much Diablo 3.

I again only spent about 5-10 minutes on the subreddit this month due to a lack of interest. I'm too busy with life. I have noticed that my stress levels are way down. A friend of mine said the sense of dread from my face was now gone.

She added: **""I’m basically living on credit now.""**

...

>Steve Reaves, the president of the union that represents FEMA workers, said Friday that he was getting four or five times the number of calls he ordinarily received from his membership. “The worry’s mounting, the stress is mounting,” Mr. Reaves said. “Their concern is, what do we next? Where do we go from here? **How are we going to make ends meet and pay our bills?”**

...

> “It’s a real challenge for us,” said Cari Thomas, a retired rear admiral and the chief executive officer of a nonprofit that is the official relief society of the Coast Guard. “It’s about $150 million each pay period to pay the active duty and civilian employees of the Coast Guard, and our nonprofit does not have $150 million, as you can imagine.” She said she had been on the phone on Friday morning with **a senior member of the Coast Guard, who is not eligible for the aid and was in tears, worrying about whether he would be able to pay his rent on Jan. 5.**

>**“We spent money on Christmas and all that thinking that we were going to have a paycheck on the first, and now we were told today that it’s official, we’re not getting one,”** said Britaini Armitage, 30, whose husband is a gunner’s mate in the Coast Guard and is deployed in the Middle East.

I am no longer a government worker, but this happened to me a few years back and is part of what motivated me to work towards FIRE. If this happened to me today, I'd be sitting back enjoying the impromptu vacation, maybe working on some projects or hobbies I've been meaning to get around to.

While I know the majority of people that visit this subreddit are well prepared, I just want to reiterate to any newcomers that this is another reason why it is worth it to work towards FIRE, even if it seems like a goal you may never reach. Even a small war chest can be a lifesaver in these situations. Suddenly not knowing if you can pay rent or feed your family is one of the worst *preventable* feelings you may ever feel. Being able to walk away as you want, or remain standing if the world walks away from you, is worth every penny you put towards it.",financialindependence

It's really great to see all of these interpretations of my post. Seeing what each person gets out of it is super cool and kinda fun to see what part of the post they resonate with vs what they do not. I'll go ahead and give my clarification for what I meant, but feel free to continue seeing it as you do!  

1. For context, this came about after a break up where I realized my life had been stagnant and unchanged for multiple years. I was 21 when I started to work, and 26 when I wrote that post. In that time my life was very much the same. I lived in the same crappy cheap apartment, I worked at the same company (diff position for higher money, but still same place and city), I ate at the same restaurants ordering the same things, and I simply didn't have any life changing experiences in that time. I was still afraid of the ocean/sharks, I still had negative feelings towards bars and going out, I constantly scrutinized costs for everything, and more. This final point was a big piece of it for me, because I felt like I simply had stopped learning/growing outside of learning new skills for my job. The only thing that changed in my life was the size of my nest egg, which I used to obsess over but eventually I realized that more money wasn't generating anymore happiness, and my side hustle starting/growing (Twitch streaming).
2. At that point I realized how miserable I had become. I thought I was doing things right. Saving 75% of my income, starting a side hustle, having my gf, working out, etc. But I wasn't happy. I wasn't growing, I wasn't changing, I was simply sacrificing my time for money for the sake of retiring without knowing what the heck I was going to retire to. I had a very simple picture in my life of like ""well I'll do what I want"" but I hadn't even tried a lot of the stuff I was considering. And around that point I decided it was time to change sooner rather than later, because life is too short to willingly be miserable right now.  
3. So I sat down and wrote the email that I talked about in my updated post. I sought out others to help push me to grow and change myself for the better. I gave myself a happiness budget and accepted that I might work a little bit longer (it's shorter than you think it would be) in order to be happy now and to find what I want in the future. Maybe I realize I don't want any luxuries, maybe I find something that is a bit expensive but is WORTH working an extra month or two in my life for, I didn't know but it was worth checking out. Over the course of the next year I did everything I possibly could and faced as many fears as I could as well. And it grew me up. It grew me to realize how beautiful life is and that there are some things that I want to work for and that gave me a bit more purpose. Scuba diving cost me $2000 for a week long trip + $400 in gear. This was the most expensive of the activities but it was worth it to me because it started the chain of conquering my fears. Being 100ft down in this beautiful alien underworld staring a shark in the face reminded me of this quote: 

> I would rather be ashes than dust! 
I would rather that my spark should burn out 
    in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. 
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom 
    of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. 
The function of man is to live, not to exist. 
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. 
I shall use my time.  -Jack London's ""Credo""

4. I would rather be ashes than dust. It was the perfect summation for the last 5 years of my life. I was sitting there as dust gathering on my boring stable life. And as that moment passed I realized I would rather have gone SCUBA diving and had something gone wrong than been afraid of diving and living in fear of it my whole life. After that trip was over, I found myself not caring to add diving in as a yearly expense or anything as the price tag was a bit high for my enjoyment level, but I am 100% happy I took the plunge and did it once because of the life lesson and value gained from it there. This is something that I think a lot of people in this sub don't appreciate enough, the value of happiness and life lessons that may be gained from spending money in certain situations.  
5. After SCUBA was my ski trip which I have talked at lengths about but I'll mention again. I didn't want to go. I thought, ""I don't like the cold, it seems kinda boring, expensive, and tedious, and I could probably have just as much fun playing a video game or reading a book or something."" I actually told my friend I wasn't planning on going until she said something along the lines of, ""Isn't the whole point of this year to change your lifestyle and stop being a negative scrooge who thinks they know everything about happiness?"" So I went. And just like the SCUBA trip changed me for the better, so did the ski trip. First thing I realized was how little I knew about my true happiness and love for life. I would have bet anybody $1000 that I would not enjoy skiing before I went, but I would have lost it so easily. I loved skiing. Standing up at the top of 12K ft overlooking the Rockies was worth the price alone, but it was so much better than that. I loved the snow, the trees, the challenge, the speed, etc. I thought I would be miserable worrying about the money I had spent the whole trip but I simply was too happy to even care. Of course I had planned the trip on the best budget I could and found the best deals I could to keep it from being too expensive, so it was no longer time to worry. So I didn't.  And after the ski trip was over I realized for the first time in my life I found something beyond ""I want to retire because I don't like working and being in the rat race"" as a reason for saving money.  
6. The rest of the year continued like this. I listed the more expensive activities but many of them were free. Sometimes it was just driving to a new city and grabbing lunch, other times it was going out in a state park and hiking to a waterfall, and many times I pushed myself to try new things whenever I could. That $25 class was no longer just ""a wasted expense"" but a time that I could learn about my interests and push myself. At restaurants I would tell the waiter/waitress to order me their favorite dish on the menu without telling me what it was. If there was ever something I was afraid of doing I would go do it. My fears were irrational in many cases (as they many times are) and I started to see that my fear of spending money on anything had been limiting my life as well. And at the end of the year I had a giant list of new interests, foods, places, and desires that I never knew I wanted in my life; and with that came more happiness and confidence than I ever thought possible. The previous me would have laughed at the current me and said, ""What a waste. Sounds like someone who got roped into living a lavish lifestyle and now is gonna be a sucker to it for the rest of their life."" But it's just simply not that. It's 1000x better than that.  

8. I don't think money buys happiness nor do I think you need all of these luxuries in life, but I do think it's always worth pushing yourself and your barriers to continue growing and then trusting that you will make smart decisions in the future. Is it really so bad that current me has decided to budget for skiing in the future? Past me would think so, but that's silly! Current me is smart enough to weigh the value of more money vs skiing and determine if the happiness gained is greater than or less than the extra months of work. So trust future self to make smart decisions. We are all AMAZING savers here with some of the best money handling skills in the world. And this money spent didn't even really affect my FI date. I thought it would set me back years but it set me back like...1 month. And if I wanted to add in some expensive activity like a ski trip every year it set me back...1 more month. So it was simply a no brainer for me and it's ridiculous how I used to get so up in arms about things like this. And what's crazier is how I used to think I would let it spiral out of control. ""Well first I'll be okay with a ski trip, then I'll be wanting $5000 skis and I'll be flying first class to the Swiss Alps and I'll have completely lost myself!"" I had such a fear of losing myself to lifestyle inflation without giving my future self any credit for being responsible. Once again, I was living with an irrational fear. In the end I would rather be happy and working now than miserable and working 2 months less in my life.    

So that's where the phrase ""Build the life you want, then save for it"" came from. I don't just mean plan it, I mean start living it and experiencing it. Don't just build that list of stuff you want for the future, build it for the now too. Why do we pride ourselves so much on our ability to be miserable now? We always talk about how we ""sacrifice"" so that we can stop working faster. Why isn't living the happiest life while saving money our goal? It feels like we get so caught up in competing (with others or even simply ourselves) that we drive ourselves into a bit of that misery. And I don't speak for everyone, but I speak for the person I was before and for those I see around here who are in that same spot and mindset. For the people who talk about money not equaling happiness but watch/update their spreadsheets daily, check the market daily to see any gains/losses, and celebrate all the money milestones along the way. Because that was me, counting down the years for my life to start when all along I had the power to start it any day.

1023,How luxurious a life ought one aim for?,,744,gllx1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gllx1u/how_luxurious_a_life_ought_one_aim_for/,1589744671.0,"Of course, one answer is: ""Depends on the person."" But let's assume for the sake of this question we're avoiding that response.

I sometimes wonder if my life would be significantly better with more luxury. I have gotten to almost 50 living kind of like a college student. I drive a 2004 used car, have never owned a home, wear shirts that were Christmas presents from 20 years ago, essentially all our furniture is found or hand-me-downs, we eat out maybe once every three months, we rent a so-so house in a so-so area, I bargain shop and fret about purchases for months or even years, etc. 

Because of all this, I've thought of myself as more in the ""leanFIRE"" category and was glad to think I could get by without working fewer years. Imagine a childless couple getting by on $30k to $35k/yr on average (including rent cost). However, I wonder if I am being foolish in not enjoying the *somewhat* finer things of life at least somewhat more?  I'll never need a swimming pool, but a ""funner"" home (in a higher COL area), less bargain shopping, more musical gadgets, more trips, more restaurants, etc. may be worth working for more, at least some.

I'm a 24 year old who's been lurking around this sub for a while now - basically since I got my first job and realized I really don't want to work for the rest of my life. I'm super grateful to you all for getting me on the right track. I make about $85K gross at the moment, and my NW is sitting right around $95K. 

I've been working from home for the last 2+ months, and it's wearing on me, and really making me miss my extremely expensive hobby: horseback riding (jumpers, specifically, if there are any horse people out there). I miss riding terribly, ever since I graduated college and stopped. It quite literally is the only thing that has ever brought me that level of happiness/joy/passion before. But I don't think there is any way around the fact that it's completely incompatible with FIRE for me, unless I up my earning significantly (which won't happen anytime soon).

1026,Honest Question: How worried are you about busting your balls for Early Retirement only to drop dead with millions of dollars in the bank?,,744,5n5iat,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5n5iat/honest_question_how_worried_are_you_about_busting/,1484060829.0,"A few weeks ago a guest at our little boutique beach resort in Mexico told me that one of the big draws to choosing Gecko Rock was that he'd read about it in this sub and was intrigued at how our business related to Financial Independence.

I was surprised because (A) I am not a member of this sub and never posted in here about our business and (B) I have actually read through this sub on multiple occasions but didn't feel that the FIRE concept really aligned with my personal beliefs with regards to savings & life planning, etc. - which is why I never joined.

At any rate, we discussed the topic to great degree and while many of my life choices fall along a similar vein (i.e. creating a financial reality differing from the norm), I personally prefer to take some of my retirement every year while I am young and can truly enjoy it versus saving it all up for the end.

I just turned 40 this year and so while I still feel young, I look back at the last 20 years of my life and see a world of experiences that would be impossible (or at least improbable) to recreate in your 40s or 50s, let alone 60s and beyond.

I understand the basic tenets of yearning for FIRE but I can't help but see the major pitfall of giving up the best decades of your life in order to avoid work at a time in your life when you either can't or no longer desire to do certain things.

A friend of ours dropped dead at 58 last year with millions of dollars in the bank. He had just retired at 57...which isn't crazy young, but young enough when you're talking about retirement.

I realize that I'll likely get a lot of answers here about budgeting in enough money to enjoy life while still piling on the savings/investments but I am also curious if there are others out there who think like me. I don't mind working until I am 75 just as long as I get 2-3 months off from working every single year along the way.

**EDIT: Welp, this blew up :)**

Lots of interesting stuff in this thread and I'm not ashamed to admit that to a certain degree I was ignorant and didn't fully know what I was talking about.

I was definitely under the impression that most people seeking FIRE were hoping to call it quits with multiple millions in the nest egg. It never crossed my mind that someone ""retiring"" at 40 might only have $500-$600k in the bank with plans to live very frugally off 4% of the nut annually. 

On one hand that helps me to understand the concept more, while simultaneously raising a whole slew of new questions.

I would like to address the presumption that I am ""blowing all my money"" on frivolous material goods as this is not the case at all. I am not against saving for the future and when I said that I don't mind working until 75 I certainly didn't mean working a full-time slave-labor type job. I actually live a pretty frugal existence and by far and away my #1 expense is that I enjoy having periods in my life when I am not working and therefore not earning.

I was simply questioning the concept of saving such a high percentage of your income during the best years of your life (I still stand by my assertion that your 20s and 30s are pretty prime decades for living) in order to get out of the game at say, 40.

Just questioning, not judging.

1027,"Uncommon Opinion #1: You spend too much time cutting expenses, and not enough time growing your career.",,737,5dux3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5dux3r/uncommon_opinion_1_you_spend_too_much_time/,1479594243.0,"Hi all, I've been reading this subreddit for a long time and I've been FIRE-minded for even longer. I've seen many posts recently mentioning the lack of new content in this community. In response to this, I'd like to share some of the ideas I've reflected upon in my FIRE journey that I feel are underrepresented in discussion. 

People are all naturally inclined to focus more on what (they think) they can control. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in r/frugal, r/simpleliving, and yes, r/financialindependence.

Deterministic decisions (changing your 401k contribution percentage, changing your asset allocation, choosing to pack lunches, and buying your toilet paper in bulk) are all easy wins and the effects are quickly observable. These decisions all provide satisfyingly short feedback loops, but the rewards are limited. 

On the other hand, decisions that are more multi-faceted, more complex and more open-ended, such as starting a business, constructing a framework for an optimal path to promotion, determining a strategy for job-hopping to maximize salary growth, and finding the outside continuing education courses with the best ROI, are generally pursued less as they are more difficult and unclear. However, the rewards can be much, much greater.

If you really want to get to FI faster, I'm strongly of the opinion you need to spend much more of your time on the second type of decision. Rather than spending hours upon hours tweaking your FIRE model with ""your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine"" predictions and speculations, spend your hours at the library building the skill you need to get to accelerate your promotion schedule. Rather than looking at what coupons you can use for your next grocery run, refresh yourself on the opportunities in your industry with a networking session, a talk with a recruiter, or just a serious independent research effort. Rather than spending more than a few hours trying to save under $100, spend those hours constructing the path to increase your annual income by $5000. Rather than spending time retorting this argument lamenting about how your job is not meritocratic and that added effort will not lead to more income, find a job that is more meritocratic. 

None of these things are easy, I know, but that's the point. If you care about reaching the goal faster though, then do what is hard but right, not just what is consequentially closer and easier. This entire concept analogizes to the irrationality of being ""penny-wise, dollar-foolish"".

I recognize that side-hustles are brought up from time to time as really the one idea that focuses more on the income side of the ""raise income, cut expenses"" FI mantra. However, I find that most of the time, these are inefficient uses of time if the goal is strictly income growth. They generally operate completely separately to one's main career, and as a result, it becomes very difficult for a person to make meaningful progress in either the career or the side hustle. I can elaborate more on my position on this later, as I don't want it to detract from the main point of this post.

I apologize if any of this comes off as rude. I'm just passionate about this particular idea and I fundamentally believe it to be true. I frequently reflect upon how I'm allocating my time and I always strive to never spend too much of it on these ""penny-wise"" decisions. I know that if I continue to grow and develop myself in alignment with the plan I have for getting to the next level in my career, I will reach my FIRE goal much faster. FWIW, I went from factory work as a teenager, to multiple unpaid internships, to a good job out of college and eventually an upper 6 figure income.

EDIT: Quite the response! Glad to see that we've got some fresh discussion going. I'll respond to you guys when I have time. I have a few other unconventional FI-related ideas that I'm excited to share with you guys later.",financialindependence

I left the university in December, moved to the (bigger) suburbs with my family, bought a new house for half of what I qualified for, and put my son in a FAR better school system than what we had before.

The biggest surprise of the move was just how much less stressed out I am. While I work far more hours than I did before, with much less vacation, it wasn't until I escaped academia that I realized how emotionally invested I was in the job. Every piece of bad news, every student who decided not to come, every year with a no pay raise, every faculty member that left whose position wasn't filled, every budget cut... it all took its toll. No amount of vacation was going to make up for that for me.

All amounts are in USD, for just myself.

For me, 500k is basically LeanFIRE. I could return to the city I used to live in and spend 18-20k a year and be perfectly content. I hit 500k recently with the recent boom in the market. I won’t RE right now, but theoretically I should feel some kind of relief at this point because I am leanFIRE, but I don’t really.

Started working January 2015

2015 – 70k income, 24k expenses

2016 – 100k income, 19k expenses

2017 – 140k income, 17.5k expenses

2018 – 145k income – 18k expenses

2019 – 200k income – 40k expenses -> I moved to VVHCOL city here

2020 – 250k income – 40k expenses

Expected 2021 – 250k income – 36k expenses

Most of my compensation is base salary. A small portion is cash bonus. No stocks.

**Financial Anxiety**

You’d think I would feel better/relaxed now, but I don’t. You’ll notice a common theme in this post, and that’s anxiety. I have anxiety over spending money, saving money, investments, you name it.

It’s affected my relationships a lot. At times I have been overly controlling even about my partners financial habits. Pre-covid I was seeing a therapist to help deal with this anxiety, and it has actually helped a lot to improve my personal relationships, because now I can at least recognize and feel/touch the anxiety. Before it was just hidden, unknown emotions that I couldn’t place a trigger on. I never thought of myself as an anxious person until therapy. I am outgoing, well-spoken, have no social anxiety, and don’t get anxious about presentations or speaking engagements. I do get anxious though when I splurge on a single purchase because it feels like I’m slipping into lifestyle inflation and my whole world is falling apart. I do get anxious when my partner purchases a single splurge item because I extrapolate it to the extreme - to them having given up on FIRE, and therefore we are incompatible and should break up because ‘clearly FIRE isn’t important to them’. I do get anxious when my partner didn’t want to implement auto deposits every month, because they preferred every 1-2 months just going and manually doing it. To me that just felt like it was so easy to just let everything slip and fall out of control. But they had a method and it works. At the end of the day, our annual spending is very close and I really have no reason to complain or comment on anything that my partner does money wise.

Sounds crazy when you write it out, and I’ve improved a lot in this regard. Therapy has helped. My partner bought a $300 splurge item recently and I barely commented on it. My partner doesn’t do automatic deposits to investments every paycheck and it doesn’t bother me at all anymore. Therapy helped me understand that these were not rational reactions and I was actually reacting to the feeling of ‘losing control’ and ‘things just slipping’. I still often feel the financial anxiety, but the difference is that I understand the emotion for what it is – a mental illness. I can control my reactions, even if I sometimes can’t control my feelings. Before I didn’t realize it was anxiety, I thought my viewpoints were totally justified.

Hell, I even bought a PS5 recently for $500 and it didn’t bother me that much! I’m thankful to now understand how annoyed I would be if my partner made a huge deal every time I wanted to buy something like this. We are all adults and as long as our annual spending is reasonably in line with our goals we are fine.

So hitting LeanFIRE hasn’t really done much for me either. It doesn’t feel real at all. I’m still working and slaving away. I keep trying to tell myself that I don’t ‘need’ to work, but it doesn’t feel like that. I’m not sure if this is because I know in RE I won’t follow 4% rule, likely 3%, or if I will started to feel relaxed as I gain more NW. I basically feel the same as when I was 0 NW. It might also because I feel battered and exhausted from work. If anything, I feel more like a battered, nervous wreck than I was when I was at $0 NW. Back then I felt like I had energy, and enthusiasm, and wanted to take on the world of work. Now I just want to quit. **I shouldn't feel anxiety, but I do**. To be frank I'm extremely lucky and privileged, but sometimes it just doesn't matter. Rationally I know I am very lucky and in a fantastic position. Emotionally it doesn't feel like that.

**RE plans**

I plan to work for another 5-6 or so years, but that may vary depending on a few factors. My job right now causes me a lot of anxiety. The hours are not too bad, but the pressure is high, there is often conflict, tensions are very high, and I am judged on the basis of my decision making. If I make poor decisions it affects the whole business, and I am solely responsible for making a lot of decisions. I basically hope to hold on as long as I can. Every year I am adding 130k to my investment portfolio, with an after-tax savings rate of more than 75% (I pay a LOT of taxes), so I understand the value in trying to just keep working a little bit longer. I think my goal RE number is about 1.5M, which by normal projections I would hit by 2025/2026. I also have a partner who is on the same path but a little bit younger and so is a little bit behind me. Having more cushion in my number will help my partner’s situation as well and make them feel more comfortable about RE.

I might not make it 5-6 years. I don’t know. The last 2 years have been really hard. I’m just trying to hold on as long as I can because my income is high relative to my NW. On the flip side, I might work 10 more. Trying to be flexible.

My reasons for wanting to retire are multifold

1. My job affects my mental health a lot. I just feel so much better when I’m on vacation and away from the office and away from the work stress. I’m a much happier person, my partner notices it too and says I’m a much happier person to be around when I’m away from work. This has only gotten worse as I’ve moved up in roles. When I first started my career it wasn’t so bad. Now it even affects my sleep. WFH doesn’t help this either, it actually makes it worse. It’s not the hours, it’s the pressure to succeed and the stress. I actually enjoy my work when it is lower stress periods – although not enough to spend 40 hours a week doing it. I don’t like being forced to do anything. I would consider to voluntarily work 15 hours a week even if it was unpaid, but roles like that don’t really exist for me. I don’t have enough work experience to become an independent consultant just yet, but that might be something I do down the road.
2. I want to see the world and live abroad. When I retire I will definitely move around. Having financial cushion to be flexible there helps. I don’t know for how long, or where, but FIRE gives me maximum flexibility.
3. I have a lot of hobbies and other ways to spend my time. I could sit at home for 3 months straight and not be bored. That’s not how I plan on spending retirement, but I have lots of things I want to do with my free time instead of working.
4. I probably thinking about retiring every single day. I’m actively trying to not do this, after this post and responding to comments, I won’t be coming back to this sub often. I just need to get away and focus on things outside of work to try and be happy in my day to day life.

I want to work longer and not RE yet because

1. I want more cushion because of my financial anxiety
2. I might want to spend more down the road
3. I’d be nervous about my ability to re-enter the workforce if I left and the market doesn’t do well
4. My income to networth ratio leads itself to saying I should push through as long as I can. If I was only making 30k a year with this stress, good chance I’d just quit and/or work part-time on something relaxing.
5. I have a hard time because I feel like I've struck a golden lotto ticket. Billions of people would kill to be in my shoes and I just feel like a big whiny pants sometimes. Why would I quit when I have such a nice income and reasonable hours?

I don’t want kids and neither does my partner.

**Income**

My income has gone up a lot, and I’ve taken a different route than most people who have income jumps like this. I’ve stayed at the exact same company who has treated me well. I’ve worked hard and been promoted fast. I’ve negotiated comp three times, but not that hard. My comp might be 10k less if I hadn’t. I also compare my compensation to people at my level in the company, and I am similarly paid to them. I’ve also spoken to external recruiters, and I’m being paid fairly. I think the notion that you need to change jobs every 3 years to maximize comp isn’t true 100% the time. If you spend the time to negotiate, compare to your peers, and have a company who treats you right financially, there isn’t a need to move around. Every company is different. Some companies you may need to hop around because they will treat you poorly financially if you are there too long. I’ve worked on 3 different teams in the same company. Also, in 2019 I moved to a VVHCOL city, and my income jumped as a result. I knew the \~250k role was coming in 2020, so that’s why the expense increase was worth it. My savings rate went down, but my total savings $ went up, and I won’t retire to VVHCOL city.

I won’t be sharing my industry or my location or any other information.

**Expenses**

I discovered FIRE midway through 2015 and started being more conscious of expenses then. I also had a few extra expenses such as some student debt to pay off in 2015. I was always frugal, but became a lot more focused once I figured out I could retire early. The biggest thing I changed after discovering FIRE was just cooking more.

I didn’t go to school in the US so my education was significantly cheaper. I graduated with only a few thousand dollars of debt. My parents contributed about $8000 to my education, the rest was self-funded. Worked in high school, had internships in college, etc.

Now my expenses are high, but of the 40k total expenses, over 2k of that is my share of the rent. I share a 1-bedroom apartment with my partner. I live in a very expensive city, but I could easily drop my expenses back down to the \~20k level by moving.

**Investments**

I’m roughly 50/50 VTI and VXUS. I believe in global diversification. The US has done very well lately, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will continue to do well in the future. My investment strategy is basically to mimic the ETF VT. If US becomes a larger proportion of the global stock market, so will my portfolio. Basically what I am saying is that I don’t rebalance. I purchase ETFs every paycheck, and my strategy is just to buy to get myself closer to the VT proportion. VT is around 50/50 now, so I almost just alternate every paycheck buying VTI and VXUS. I don’t need to do anything large because as my ETFs move up and down in value, they are automatically moving towards my goal asset allocation, because my goal is a moving target. As well, my post-FIRE plans lead well to holding high amounts of VXUS as I want to have larger exposure to different currencies.

I didn’t change anything during the brief covid recession. Just kept plugging along.

Real estate is too much work for me. I don’t want to be a landlord. I don’t own the home I live in because I want to move often and 5 years isn’t enough for it to be worthwhile.

**Other ideas**

I’ve toyed with just moving abroad now, and quitting my job and accepting a lower paycheck. That might happen if someday I just can’t hold on any longer. It would be hard for me to take a lower paycheck at this time, maybe if I had a larger NW. I love where I live but I also want to see the world and live abroad.

I’ve toyed with finding a different job that is lower stress, but I’m not sure it exists at this compensation range in my profession. I also enjoy that my hours are reasonable at my job. Sometimes I miss the days of 2015 where I made 70k a year and had no real responsibility. I worked slightly more hours back then, but I wasn’t the one who was ultimately responsible, and my work stress was significantly less. But I’d rather work 5 more years at 250k than 15 more at 70k.

I don’t have a networth tracker. Sorry! I have no idea. They’d be guesses.

**Summary**

That’s it. Feel free to AMA. I was a little bit afraid to make this post because I didn't want to just be another ""High income earner reaching FIRE at a young age"" post, but I think the other aspects of my situation hopefully make things more interesting. I definitely recognize rationally that I've had a fortunate upbringing and am lucky to be here.

FIRE can't control your life. Easier said than done, but I know what I need to do. I need to do things to make my daily life happier, stop daydreaming about retirement, and just be happy. I will only have my 30s once.

Also - therapy is amazing. If you tried it before and didn't like it, try it again with a different therapist! Took me 3 or 4 to find one that clicked.",financialindependence

Under the recommended **Books**, there’s a **Philosophy section**. There it lists a few including a Stoicism book, “A Guide to the Good Life” which I enjoyed. It took me to r/stoicism which I’ve been getting more recommendations from lately. 


Now to the point of this post: Something I’ve read which I really enjoyed was [“A Man’s Search for Meaning” by Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning). He was a neurologist and psychiatrist who survived 3 years in concentration camps during WWII. He wrote a two part book, the first detailing his experience in the camps, and the second summarizing his “Logotherapy” philosophy. 

I think it would be a worthwhile book to add to the list. It’s a pretty quick read and he has a simple writing style that lets you finish it in about a day. 

Just as well, he happens to mention money at least once…
>“Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money.""

It would be good to read if someone is getting a little carried away in the FI part of their life while forgetting to plan for a life to live after reaching it. I know I found it helpful!

This seems to be on a lot of people's minds these days in this community.  I have heard and read a lot recently that if your portfolio cannot handle a 30 percent drop, you are not ready to RE.  Is this 30 percent being thrown around for any specific reason other than it is close to what just happened in the markets?  Before COVID-19, rarely if ever was the FIRE community posting these recommendations.  This for me is a great prep/case study time period to ensure when I pull the RE trigger, I definitely have a cushion.

Main question:  Why 30 percent cushion, why not 50 or 15?  Is there any data around this or just a nice sounding padded number (30)?",financialindependence

I am absolutely loving it.  I have never worked harder but maybe something about getting back 3 hours of my day ( getting ready, commuting, settling into the office) has made it so satisfying, inspite of the hard work.

A permanent change that I believe will come about due to the pandemic is a much bigger expansion of WFH (work from home).  It’s like this will change working conditions for most folks, especially in tech.

For me personally, RE is a little less important than maybe 2 months ago.  FI is still as important.  Not sure if this feeling will change in 6 months.

1038,I became FI!! Story and details...,,733,dct4wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dct4wb/i_became_fi_story_and_details/,1570119489.0,"*TLDR: reached FI through combination of hard work and luck. FI ain’t everything. Warning: lots of humblebragging ahead!*

I’ve been running after financial security since I was a wee lad. I figured I had no inheritance (not a wealthy but a hardworking family). I grew up in India, and nepotism was a reliable strategy there to get to a better station in life – and I didn’t have those connections either. I wasn’t poor and certainly didn’t feel poor, but might be considered such by western standards (family income was less than $500/month – which is actually not that bad in 80s India!). Anyway, I thought my only ticket to a comfortable life was to work harder than others around me.

The wheels to FI were set in motion when I became a teenager. I got serious about studies and went from near-last in class to first in one year. I remember studying by candlelight (my town had chronic electricity issues), and picking my skin to point of blood in order to stay awake. I would mark the pages I knew by heart by little smudges of my blood (I know, gross, but I gotta paint a picture here!). There is no-one besides my wife that knows this crazy stuff. Didn’t let up on the gas and ultimately got a full scholarship to a US college. I owe a lot to US colleges investing in foreign students.

About 5 years ago I sat down and thought seriously about FI. Didn't know about this community or the fire movement then, but I've dreamt of ""financial independence"" at least since I entered the workforce in my very early 20s. I just hated depending on ‘the man’. Based on no math whatsoever, I figured my goal was to get to $4M by age 40, and then I'd feel financially secure. I think there is a tendency to overshoot when SWR math is not known, and I was certainly guilty of it. Plus the symmetry between 4-M and 4-0 seemed pleasing, so it must be the right number!

I hit the financial goal I had for age 40 years ahead of schedule! This deserves some explanation. I didn’t get here by IPO, crypto, tech route. If you think I’m envious of those – I am. If I could get here by less suffering, I would have.

After college I worked in management consulting (think MBB). I lived extremely frugally and saved money. However, I did save it wrong (traditional savings account earning 0.0x%…ouch!). Growing up I was told stock markets were ‘gambling’…my dad lost money in the Indian exchanges. It took me until my early 30s to deprogram that shit and start investing. I carried the blood-letting studying ethic into my working years. Spent (misspent?) my 20s on work. Like Forest Gump, I gumped my way to long hours year after year trying to get to the top of my field. I never stopped running. I was so afraid of failing. A lonely and scared immigrant pretending to live a normal life. Working 18 hours days...and going back in the wee hours of the night to my 300 sq.ft apartment. I did this for years. A decade in fact.

However, I didn’t get to my goal just by saving my salary (which is great, but not *that* great). I got there by creating a solution for old industries to modernize by leveraging advanced analytics – winning huge contracts and getting rapidly promoted to profit-sharing role. What they say is true, in many scenarios not including hi-tech/medicine – W2 comp alone is not going to get you to the very high numbers.

Speaking of numbers. I discussed with my SO and we figured that we need around $130k pre-tax to account for our foreseeable annual expenses. What precipitated this post is that I realized that I am expecting my dividend & investment income (100% passive) to be a little above $130k in 2020!

Here is how that is generated:

1. House: $700k (no income)
2. Equities: $5.5M (about $110k passive income). Mostly in index funds, I dabbled in individual stocks and I'm now selling them selectively (e.g. when total return is negative) and shoveling into index. Bogle is investing gospel.
3. Bonds+money market+cash: $1.3M (about $25k passive income)

Now, for the final part. Having gotten to ""FI"",  I realize that it's not everything. Don't get me wrong, it is **awesome** to not stress about money. It is **incredible** to have FU money and so I don't stress about work either. It's just that goals change. There are some things I want to work on now. These are health, cultivating new friendships, and if I'm being brutally honest - rediscovering who the fuck I am after years of chasing financial security. What am I interested in? How do I want to live my life? How do I want to contribute (without running a concurrent analysis of the $ I'm getting in return)?

No regrets though. My journey made me who I am. I am looking forward to who I become and incredibly grateful to have the FI tailwind in my sail. I was lucky, I worked hard, I fucked up but then got up.

**Edit#1:** More (useless?) practical details: I use Schwab as my main brokerage. Love their customer service and low cost. I was using Robinhood too, but for various reasons just ported that account over to Schwab (can explain my decision if you ask). I'm trying to make sure all my index funds have gross expense ratios much smaller than 0.1% (my biggest holding is SCHB with 0.03%). In terms of money market funds, vanguard has some really good ones such as VUSXX (no state taxes, good for states with high taxes and for high-income years) and VMMXX. They pay similar to Ally, which is my HYSA. I keep FDIC-covered about $250-300k in Ally, rest cash in these money market funds.",financialindependence

1040,Have any of you taken a year off saving for retirement?,,734,h95fha,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/h95fha/have_any_of_you_taken_a_year_off_saving_for/,1592181432.0,"I am currently 34 and plan to retire around 60. At my current rate of saving, I could have my house paid off by 41 and FIRE at 47, but I like my job.

A combination of three things is making me consider taking a year off retirement investing. First, I have a toddler who *loves* to be outside, and a second kid on the way. Second, we've been largely quarantined for 3 months now. And these two lead to my third: I really want to invest in our backyard and make it a really nice place to spend time.

I'm not yet maxing out my 401k investment annually, but if I reduce my 401k investment to just the amount my company matches, that adds around $3k in 2021 to our cash balance. Add in $12,000 not going to Roth IRA accounts and the ~$1500/month extra we have for general savings or investing and we could knock out a ton of outdoor living improvements next year. Right now, we have a fence that's falling over and an open lawn with no shade such that afternoons and evenings (until the sun completely goes down) are miserable.

What I'm wondering is, from your perspective, is losing that year acceptable? I'm really torn on it. On the one hand, we're going to live in this house the rest of our lives, our kid (and from what I can tell, all kids) loves to be outside, and we would benefit from being able to really enjoy our yard more and sooner.

On the other hand, it's not the financially responsible decision. I can't really figure out how much taking 2021 off from retirement savings would decrease our net worth at retirement... but it kind of looks like, if all I did was meet my company's match and leave our Roth IRA to appreciate for the rest of my working life, we'd still probably have more than we need. Resuming regular retirement savings in 2022 should jump us back up to likely having more than we need.

But we also can't know the future... so I don't know. I appreciate any input or feedback you all have.",financialindependence

1042,I am a lawyer who FIRED.

I recently quit my job as a partner in a large east coast law firm after practicing law for about fifteen years.  I'm going to be spending the foreseeable future traveling.  

I don't think we see too many lawyers that FIRE, though I could be wrong.  The profession tends to attract people who are very conservative, not politically, but in their lifestyle.  Law school is viewed as a ""safe"" path.  So people that go down that path often are not interested in strange things like FIRE.  It is also a job that requires a very large initial investment:  seven years of very expensive college.  And, contrary to what many people believe, most lawyers do not make a lot of money.  So, in many ways, it is not really an ideal profession for FIRE.  But there a few lawyers, primary partners in big law firms, that can make quite a bit of money.  If you work very hard, go to an elite law school, get top grades, and are very lucky, you can land a position in a big law firm.  If you work hard and are lucky again, you might become a partner and make  lot of money, and FIRE very quickly.  I have seen partners in big firms get paid anywhere from $100,000 a year to $10 million.  I was very lucky, but not approaching anywhere near that high end.  

Pretty much every lawyer I know, however, experienced extreme lifestyle inflation as their pay grew.  I avoided this and maintained a comfortable, but very reasonable lifestyle.  My spending, in fact, was pretty much always well below that of the typical first year associate.  Even before I went to law school, I always knew I intended to retire early.  So I saved aggressively from day one.  

When I told my partners I was leaving and not to go to another job, but just to relax and travel, the majority thought I was completely insane.  A few expressed some jealousy and gave me (unsolicited) reasons why they could never do the same thing  (e.g., alimony owed to ex-wives, kids in expensive schools, etc.).  In some ways, it probably is insane, because the potential future income that a partner forfeits by quitting is enormous.

As for the practice of law, I was successful at it, but I never enjoyed it and, frankly, there are aspects of it that I was quite bad at.  The hours and stress are extreme.  It was great to me financially, and I do not regret it.  But it is not something I would want to do for the rest of my life.

If anyone is interested, my portfolio is almost entirely stock index funds, more or less mirroring the world market.  I'm aiming for about a 2% withdrawal rate, not because I think that is necessary, but simply because I saved more than I really need.  I can afford to basically live off the dividends.  I will leave what is left when I die to charity.

If anybody is a lawyer or is thinking about law school, feel free to ask some questions.  And definitely feel free to tell me to fuck off.",financialindependence

Here’s the thing though. She’s 35 and her parents still pay her rent. As a former nanny and now a dog walker, she doesn’t earn much, and she also doesn’t seem motivated to work very hard. (Probably like 20 hours a week is her max, and then she feels too stressed out.)

We’ve been dating for about 2 years, serious for a year and a half of that. Almost a year ago I shared my plans for financial independence and told her how important it is to me that she learn to live within her means. She said she was going to work on it and even saved a couple thousand dollars but then she reverted back, spent her savings and started getting defensive when I brought it up.

Two years into the relationship, I am feeling like I need to make a decision. She is amazing and I love being with her.  But I can’t count on her to be a contributor for FIRE, and she might even be a liability. I don’t make much but I’m good at saving, and she isn’t a big spender but can’t get it together to break even.  Do I settle down and try to make it work or move on and try to find someone who is more compatible in this area?

**By the numbers:**

I make about 60k a year and save 2,400/mo. Between my 401k and VTSAX I’ve got about 110k. (Puts me on track for FI/RE in about 10 years). She makes enough to cover her living expenses but doesn't have health insurance or take vacations.  Her parents pay for her apartment (about $1200/mo). Neither of us have debt.

Its worth noting that her parents have offered to put a down payment on a house for us (50k max) and contribute to her savings. Neither of us are attached to having children, but it would be a shame if it wasn’t an option at all.

What do you think? Can I commit to this partner and still have the life I want or do I have to choose between them? 

Are these serious red flags or could we work as one of those relationships where I’m just the person who handles the money stuff? 

How do you talk to a new romantic partner about FI/RE when they aren't earning enough to cover their basic needs?

All my money is from me working, saving, investment gains. I live in Kansas City. I don't own property but I live with my elderly parents who are almost 80 years old. We are from Calcutta so it's not that odd for unmarried adult kids to live with parents. They are very independent both financially and in everyday life. My monthly expenses are barely $1000 since I don't pay rent. My parents absolutely refuse rent. But on their birthdays and holidays, I give them each a stack of cash, $1000 or so and I have to force it onto them, they don't want my money since they are FI but I just want them to have it. I spend probably $20k a year including those cash gifts. 

I will stay with my parents until they pass. I refuse to ever put them in a home.

I don't hate my job but I hate wasting 9 hours of my life here every day. I am an analyst on my company's finance team and I earn $85k gross. I want to get a part time job where I work 3 days a week to get health insurance and spending money. I think Starbucks or Costco. I'd like to let my $500k grow to $1m in about a decade, then completely stop working. Why? Because 4% @ $1m will be enough to cover health insurance and spending.

My other idea is to get contract finance jobs where it's only a 6 month term, make $25k to cover spending + health insurance, then I have 6 months off. 

I think I'm ready. I want to quit. I have my resignation letter typed up. I'm so scared. My plan is quit, decompress for a couple months, then go visit India for a month (I haven't been there since we left when I was 3 years old) then maybe start looking for part time work. Like I said, I have $50k liquidity set aside to last me a couple years. 

I'm going to think more over the weekend then quit on Monday.",financialindependence

Have to pay taxes on some retirement accounts and some unrealized gains still.

**College**
I worked and paid my way through most of college. 
 I graduated in May of 2013 with roughly $40k in student loans and a net worth of -$38k.  I received a signing bonus of $5.5k shortly after.  I used the money to buy a generous gift for both my brother and sister and then invested the rest into a roth IRA.

**Job**
I work in finance for an insurance company.  My salary started at 67k and has increased to roughly $90k.  My bonus over the years started at $0 (besides signing) and has increased to $10k.  I switched jobs in January of 2016 and consolidated my pension and 401k into an IRA.  Both companies I worked for offered a generous 401k match 6% then 5% and both contributed to a pension.  My average salary was around 80k but was likely closer to 90k with bonus and retirement benefits.

**Expenses**
I predict my average savings rate is likely 70%.  Rent averaged around $850 a month and was pretty cheap because I only spent 1 year living alone.  I always had roommates and more recently moved in with my girlfriend.  My net worth may take a hit in the near future as I plan to get married in the next 2 years and probably have kids shortly after.  I did kind of splurge on a car, but I really do get a lot of enjoyment out of it.  I also spend a bit more than I should on eating out.  However, I never spend money on clothes, I always ask for this for Christmas and my birthday.

**Investments**
Personally managed investments have seen great success, I predict they are between 15% to 20% annualized returns.  However, I know these high returns are not realistically attainable forever, so I am continually moving a larger percentage into passive funds.  I hope to break into real estate investments at some point in the near future as well.

**Other Comments**
I never actively sought out financial independence, I more so had an obsession with saving and investing.  One mistake I probably made was paying off my student loans instead of maxing out my 401k right out of college.  I also fear that I made a mistake by contributing too much to a roth 401k instead of a traditional 401k.  I am mostly conflicted on this due to the potential for a conversion ladder.  I definitely want to retire early, but am not sure what my savings goal is yet and imagine that will change a lot once I am married.

**Edit:**
I calculated savings rate incorrectly.  If I do after tax and include bonus and retirement benefits my average savings rate is about 63% and not 70%.",financialindependence

So I made a post about a year ago that was received well and I figured, since I hit my 3 year work anniversary today at 26, now would be a good time to do another update.  [u/RuSHiinIDaYLiTe](https://www.reddit.com/user/RuSHiinIDaYLiTe/)  also made a similar post recently which inspired me to do mine.

Old post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dmzgfe/2\_years\_of\_net\_worth\_tracking\_a\_promotion\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dmzgfe/2_years_of_net_worth_tracking_a_promotion_and/)

2020 has been a historical year. With the coronavirus, job losses and the stock market crash, we certainly witnessed some life changing events. The market crash was the first one I have ever experienced and it was wild seeing 10%+ drops in a single day.  But I knew this was what I signed up for and I stayed the course. Luckily, I remained employed throughout the year, which was a good reminder why I chose to pursue engineering in medical devices. I even negotiated a 7% raise in March which really helped me invest aggressively. As the stock market recovered, I couldn't help but feel guilty seeing my portfolio soar while others were getting laid off. It's a good reminder to never take your job for granted. This was a good experience to have, as I sometimes dread coming into work.

Onto the financials...

I started 2020 with about $42k net worth, which was made up of $9k in cash, $38k invested and $5k on my credit cards. My cc balance is never this high but I splurged on a watch at the end of 2019 to celebrate my success. I always pay my cc in full every month. Throughout the year I have been on track to max my retirement accounts for the first time while also saving additional cash on the side. This is challenging to do as I decided to go all Roth for my 401(k) and IRA. Many people have asked why I do all Roth and simply I just want to pay taxes now and be done with it. Tax-free growth is awesome, I can afford to do it, I don't know what tax bracket I'll be in during retirement and I don't know what tax rates will be in the future. I am totally fine locking in my current tax rate. I also like looking at my account balances and knowing that (almost) every dollar is mine (with the exception of employer matched funds).

Today I hit my 3 year work anniversary and am now fully vested in my 401(k), which locked in about $4k in assets. My current net worth is sitting over $80k at 26. It almost doesn't feel any different than $40k. This is because I have that FIRE mindset where I'm always living below my means and saving saving saving. My lifestyle never changes. To break down my assets, I have about $16k in my IRA, $49k in my 401(k) and $18k in cash. My net worth is now greater than my gross base salary. This progress feels great. While I don't have a lot of money, I certainly am beginning to feel more free. It's a nice taste of financial independence. Just knowing that if I lose my job I'll be totally fine is a great feeling.

So if we zoom out 3 years, I was in a much different place. I basically had no assets and $74k in debt. My parents did pay about a third of my debt and allowed me to live at home until I paid the rest off so that was a HUGE help. So in three years I was able to increase my net worth by about $154k and that was while compound interest was working against me! I can only imagine how powerful compound interest will start working for me as I reach $100k, $200k net worth and so on. The crazy part about this progress is that I am not depriving myself. I live on $1680 per month and that includes $300 to spend on whatever I want. Sometimes I bend the rules, like last month I bought a gaming laptop just because I felt like it. I don't feel bad about purchases when I have assets. But I am really able to live well on about $20k per year.

What are my goals? Well I still really want to buy a house. My fiancee and I saved up about $23k in cash combined. I'm thinking we'll need at least $50k to cover a downpayment, closing costs and a 6 month emergency fund. We are in no rush to buy a house and want to make sure that we set ourselves up for financial success before we settle down on a property. I am really excited to hit $100k net worth. If the market stays stable I think I could do it before the end of the year. If the market crashes again, so be it. My strategy won't change.

That's all I got! Thanks for reading and feel free to ask me any questions or share your progress. Happy Friday.

He says it is so that he can RE and know he is still contributing financially to our lifestyle, which I understand. I'm curious how people here handle their finances if they are in a domestic partnership.

Edit #2: wow I wasn't expecting all of these responses, thanks for your input, it gives me lots to think about! I feel like some more details may have helped since lots of you seem to have an issue with the 50/50 split (but frankly, I forgot how unique our situation is). While my husband makes more money, I *choose* to make less in some ways because I choose my own hours. And while sometimes that means I work 60 hour weeks, sometimes that means I work part-time for three months. And since we have both lived below our means to this point (i.e. our household expenses are currently under $2500/mo and we both make 6 figures), the 50/50 worked out fine.  We just bought a house in an HCOL area so things will be a little tighter, so an open discussion will need to be had.",financialindependence

Why?

&#x200B;

Because I have nothing, really to do. I have a series of tasks that I may or may not be asked to accomplish. Nothing to contribute, nothing to achieve. No sense of pride or personal value. I will do the same thing next week as I did last, and the same in 10 years. 20 years. And I'll mostly surf the web for at least 50% of my time. It's killing me to be so...unnecessary.

I'm wishing away my life so that I can 'retire', only by the time I get there, my kids will be moved out and I'll have had an empty life of misery behind me. So what was really the point? Am I going to restart at 55, or be to ruined from living 25 years with my brain switched off, and not have the power to boot up again?

&#x200B;

I sat in a meeting this morning while the power's that be argued about how to micromanage our time, and was literally thinking how I could go about breaking my own arm so that I could access a few weeks of paid sick leave. That's really not  what I want out of my working years.

&#x200B;

That said, it's totally stable and secure, and I'll never have to worry about money as long as I work here.

Full on FIRE isn't for me but I appreciate any strategy that involves breaking out of the system as we know it.

Having lived as an expat for the past 13 years with most of that time spent in developing countries I can admit that part of our long-term financial planning involves sticking to countries where we get more bang for your buck so to speak.

April will mark 6 years in Mexico, a popular destination for early (and late) retirees wanting to live a freer life on a limited pension and so I've met dozens of retired or semi-retired people here along every spectrum of income.

**And one thing is for sure: Not everyone finds the lifestyle they are looking for.**

We love living here. We prefer the pros to the cons and have discovered a happy medium between adjusting to the ""local"" way of life along with recreating what we're used to in a foreign land.

A lot of folk, however, discover that *Living Like a King* doesn't quite feel as regal (or affordable) as they expected it to - and to a great extent this is due to a misunderstanding of what taking your dollars overseas for the highlife truly looks like.

**The Biggest Mistake is Comparing Apples to Oranges**

The #1 reason people wind up disappointed in their newfound royal lifestyle overseas is that their vision of a King-like existence is quite literally, King-like.

The reality is that true luxury living is expensive anywhere in the world and that you're never going to recreate your millionaire vision on US$1500-2000/month.

What you can enjoy on such an income, however, is the type of lifestyle afforded to the top 2-5% of earners in your adopted home.

You can live VERY well & VERY comfortably - but this also requires that you shift your idea of what comfort looks like.

We like our house. It's perfectly nice. But we don't have carpets or a Lazy Boy, dishwasher, dryer and many other common amenities found in a typical upscale 1st world home. Our house feels like a nice *Mexican* house and the expats I know who wish their place to feel like a nice North American or European home pay through the teeth to make it happen - perhaps less than they'd pay at home but certainly to the extent that their lifestyle requires more than a couple grand per month in upkeep.

*Living Like a King requires a shift in perspective.* **Period.**

Most imported goods meant for the affluent will cost you more in the developing world than you pay at home - part of living like a King means adapting your tastes for more local delicacies.

**But that's not to say the benefits of moving to a cheaper country aren't real. They are real. It's just that these benefits are not applicable across the board.**

Labor/services are crazy cheap. Should it strike your fancy you can never take your own garbage out or lift a finger to clean for the rest of your life. Same goes for gardening or pool maintenance, etc.

But cheap labor also comes with caveats as staff not always understand what is expected of them, even when you speak the language.

Same goes for car repairs, plumbers, electricians and on and on.

And health care costs a fraction of what you pay at home (at least for Americans), too - perhaps it's not ""as"" good but in most circumstances you're fine.

Eating out is cheap.

But a $3 meal in Mexico comes with $3 surroundings. Nice enough but it's not going to be as comfy as Tony Roma's or Sizzler.

Going to a properly nice restaurant still costs real money. Less real money but real money nonetheless.

My point is that living as an expat can be amazing and I absolutely love that we have the freedom to control how much we work/earn by virtue of how low the cost of living is here but our day-to-day living looks little like it would if we lived in the US. 

It's not better or worse, it's just different. So if your plans involve beating feet to the 3rd world as soon as you've got half a million dollars in the bank, just remember that *Living Like a King* really means *Living Pretty Damn Well on Little Money* and not tossing money out the window of your Cadillac like a rap star.

**EDIT:** 

So...quite a few people are misreading my intent here.

I am not saying that a dishwasher, recliner and dryer are unattainable luxury goods in Mexico. I could buy these things if I so desired. I could go into town today, buy a dishwasher, put it in the truck, drive home, plug it in and wash the dishes.

I could lay carpet from wall-to-wall...buy a vacuum...and then fight vacuuming up beach sand for the rest of my life.

I am not saying that Sizzler is the pinnacle of dining excellence. I am saying that a $3 meal in Mexico won't be eaten in an air-conditioned building on a padded chair...a $10 meal will.

I am not trying to paint a picture of a floral-shirted white guy squatting over a bucket in third-world squalor in order to save a buck or two.

What I am saying is that life as an expat is different. 

If we look at the situation more abstractly, let's say that there are 100 factors of comfort/convenience that the average middle class North American/European enjoys...and that on average, a middle class Mexican enjoys 75 of these same amenities.

That leaves 25 amenities that you can choose to upgrade or choose to adapt to the local style. 

If you choose to take all 25 upgrades you won't be living on $1500/month....but you can do, say, half of them and still live well on, say, $2000 (approximate numbers).

Perhaps for you being able to dry clothes in a machine versus hanging them on the line is more important than having an XBox One & flatscreen in your bedroom...for us, we prefer to have the Xbox, something that costs a LOT more to buy in Mexico vs. the US.

Perhaps for you it's worth spending double on food stuff every month in order to eat only imported food that you know and recognize but you couldn't care less about having a fluffy USA-style sofa. Maybe someone else pays for the American furniture but eats nothing but local food.

It's a game of picking and choosing what's important to you...not a dearth of goods/services.

My point in this post is that if you want your life to look/feel EXACTLY as it does at home, then you're unlikely to see HUGE savings in cost of living. 

My point is that the ""Live Like a King"" lifestyle requires that your vision of royalty be shaped according to your surroundings...with enough sprinkles of ""home"" to be the icing on the cake.

Here are perhaps some better examples of shit you've got to get used to unless you want to pay out the nose:

**Our hot water heater and oven run on propane.** 

I quite literally have to connect a propane tank, just like you do with your BBQ (and yes, we own a BBQ, too)...when the gas runs out it stops working...I have to disconnect the tank, connect a new one and then put the old tank in the truck and drive to the gas depot or hardware store to change it for a full one. Sometimes this happens mid-shower...sometimes it happens mid-meal...sometimes you get to the hardware store and they are out of gas.

It's a pain in the ass. It's not as convenient as having an endless supply of natural gas pumped into your home. It's not as convenient as having an electric oven that you can set to an exact temperature.

You can either get used to it or you can find a middle-ground solution like buying 3-4 extra tanks to store in the garage or you can pay a lot of money to get a giant tank installed and have a propane truck come periodically to fill it.

Each of these options carry different price tags, from zero extra dollars up to thousands depending on where along the spectrum you want your convenience.

**Gravity is the standard method for producing water pressure in the home**

Most Mexican homes have a tinaco (tank) on the roof that is filled with a pump from an underground cisterna (bigger tank, haha)...all water pressure comes from gravity...meaning that a one-story home won't have a shit ton of pressure.

You can (a) get used to it or (b) install a water-pressure system....which will cost money and possibly cause problems with other plumbing fixtures in the home that aren't designed for that much pressure.

When I go back to the US and take a shower it's abso-fucking-lutely amazing...like I'm at a water park. It's phenomenal. Bigly. 

But it's not worth the money/headache to recreate my Yankee-Doodle shower here in Mexico - I clean just fine with less pressure.

**Power goes out more often**

It's not THAT bad but the power goes out (at least for a minute or two) often enough that I stopped using a desktop computer for my freelance writing work and we never set the clock on the coffee maker or microwave because some time within a week or two we'll lose power at least long enough to send it back to blinking 12:00.

Internet goes out more, too.

Not THAT bad but enough that it's not the same.

I'm not trying to say that living as an expat involves a massive reduction in quality of life...shit...not at all. We have a killer pool and a sweeping ocean view that would cost two million bucks to have in So Cal. Eating out is so cheap we don't even consider price when thinking out whether we want to go to town or eat at home. Going to the cinema costs a few bucks...going out drinking is stupid cheap...and labor is so inexpensive that you could, in theory, do almost nothing yourself. It's like $4 to have the car washed and vacuumed, Armor All on the dash and tires, while we go to a coffee shop and pay $1 for an amazing coffee made with fresh organic beans grown 2 hours away in the mountains --- but the chairs are shitty, uncomfortable stools and not big green Starbucks loungers.

I think expat life is incredible and even if I win the lottery this summer (I buy a ticket every time I go back to the US) we would still live somewhere that was neither my wife or I's homeland...we'd likely move to Spain - but that's another story.",financialindependence

I started using YNAB for the household budget, and implementing some basic MMM philosophies. Within a few months, we couldn't believe/understand how we lived/survived beforehand.

* __2012:__ we established ROTH IRAs with Vanguard, and ""MMMed"" our budget. Switched the cellphones over to H2OWireless and cut the cords. My husband started taking additional graduate courses to move up ""lanes"" in his public school salary schedule beyond his Master's.


* __2013:__ we paid off my graduate student loans and refinanced our mortgage from 4.99% to 3.625%. I finished grad school. Maxed out our IRA contributions for the first time. Our monthly expenses are now $3800 and stay there through the present.


* __2014:__ we saved for and took an amazing 2-week trip to Alaska over the summer, while upping our pre-tax retirement contributions.


* __2015:__ we saved for and took an amazing 2-week hiking trip to the Alps. Paid off my husband's undergrad loans (they had been at less than 2%) and our car loan (the other car was already paid off pre-2012). With all the additional graduate credits, husband is now at Masters +45, the highest ""lane"" he can achieve. I started at a new school, part time and 45 minutes away, but with a base salary that was 50% higher than my previous school. I supplement with a few adjunct jobs at local universities.


* __2016:__ I'm offered a full time position at the new school, effectively giving me a $35,000 raise over my 2014-15 salary, and I quit the adjunct positions. We immediately set our 403(b)s to the max. Husband leaves his school district for a new public school less than a mile from my school, so it's time to move closer into the city near our jobs. We sell the house over the summer and opt to rent in the same neighborhood we teach in. The rent is higher than our mortgage (PITI), but other factors make our monthly outflow about the same. Husband starts walking to work (10 minutes), while I drive (5-10 minutes). Husband's new district also offers a 457 plan, so we contribute his entire remaining paycheck to the plan for the rest of 2016 while supplementing our income from our house sale proceeds, and dump the rest into a taxable brokerage account.


* __2017??:__ Annual combined salaries will be ~160k. We'll be maxing out our ROTHs, both 403(b)s, and his 457 for a total retirement savings of 65k/year. Planning a 2-week trip to California (Bay Area, Yosemite, Sequoia, Big Sur) that will mostly be covered by credit card points. Net worth should hit 500k in the next few months. Husband also has been paying into the MTRS pension system, but we consider that money to be gravy (and it'll probably be quite substantial).


  

Obviously any future kids would impact our FIRE plans a bit, but we could potentially be good to go in about 6 years.

I see a lot on this sub from engineers, etc, so I thought it'd be nice for a discussion from teachers or other middle-wage earners in high COL areas. It is totally possible to achieve!

I’m hoping to buy an apartment soon so I can at least put rental income towards the mortgage/build equity.  But still, it’s a ton of money when you think about it and calculate it, which I do from time to time :/

EDIT: in response to a couple of great thoughts below, I expect that me and my future spouse split all expenses 50/50 (I’m a woman in case that matters) and I expect to work until retirement. So I think it’s reasonable my individual expenses will decrease, plus tax advantages of being married (if I’m not mistaken). 

Also, I agree kids will be an additional by far nontrivial expense but that is a separate question from expenses I’m incurring now (at least there’s the additional benefit of having a family). 

I don’t have an option of living with parents and roommates yes - definitely a great pout. It after multiple less than optimal experiences, coupled with the fear of living with strangers (founded or unfounded) and it’s a choice that I’m making.

1064,"A tale of three siblings: Privilege, Values, and Lessons Learned",,718,ios2tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ios2tg/a_tale_of_three_siblings_privilege_values_and/,1599565540.0,"I feel like there were recently some interesting posts about privilege, family, financial education/values and the impact these can have on people's likelihood to or desire to FIRE. I was just thinking about my own family and thought it'd be an interesting case study to help us better understand other's perspectives.

&#x200B;

Background: One parent is from well off-ish family (by the time I was born the wealth was more of a memory than a reality for the vast majority of this side). One parent is from a war torn third world country and moved to the US as a teen with very little support. We (siblings and I) grew up in a middle class to upper middle class town with good public schools, low crime, and mostly professional families. Our parents emphasized educational achievement (probably too much), provided an above average financial education, and demanded obedience. Offered to pay what they could for college.

&#x200B;

Parent 1 ended up a semi-disabled drug addict who lost control of their severe mental health issues and became abusive towards everyone in the family. Parent 2 ignored/tolerated/enabled this behavior from the time I was in elementary school until parent 1 died of an accidental overdose when we were all adults. Just hoping to point out that it we had some advantages and some disadvantages, like most people.

&#x200B;

Sibling 1:

Likely inherited some of the family mental illness and also bore the brunt of parental abuse. Kicked out of the house as a minor, but parents still supported financially as they lived with relatives and finished high school. Graduated at the height of the financial crisis of 08 and their college fund, which was still invested, took a major hit. They enrolled in an out of state public school, did very poorly three semesters in a row, and transferred to a less expensive school once the college money ran out. Continued to struggle in school until dropping out after 6 years and working odd jobs with a lot of student loan debt ($40k). Grew up a bit, learned some independence, and returned to school to finish up a degree after a few years. Currently working in a semi-related field making decent money ($45k), working on getting the loans down ($20k today), and saving up for a house in a LCOL area. Current NW \~-15k. Lessons to be learned: college isn't right for every person right out of high school, addressing mental health and previous trauma is really important to moving forward, and you can totally make mistakes early in life and turn it around.

&#x200B;

Sibling 2:

After sibling 1 was kicked out, parental abuse turned towards sibling 2 who dealt with it by working enough to support themselves and then heading off to college on a full ride, disconnecting from family (probably a good decision). Started roth IRA in high school and has always been a saver. Decided to go to expensive professional school funded by a now more robust college fund (having grown for several more years in a bull market), scholarships, and working. Graduated with significant debt but also married a high earner and all debt was paid off within 2 years. Currently in training making about $60k with pay expected to increase significantly after training is complete. Current NW \~$150k.  Lessons to be learned: sometimes success is found by removing the things that hinder you. The right spouse can really help FIRE move along!

&#x200B;

Sibling 3:

Largely ignored by parents. Went to in state college on a 50% scholarship, some covered by parents, some loans taken out ($20k total). Turned out to be very good at math, completed a bachelors and paid off masters before moving into corporate job making \~$85k. Paid off student loans quickly and was saving good money but also fell into life style inflation and some vices that had a negative effect on work. Also had some mental health issues to work out and was generally pretty unhappy in life. Recently decided to quit corporate and go back to school for a PhD with the hope of staying in academia. Current NW \~$80k (expected to go down through grad school as stipend is very low!). Lessons to learn: While NW is relatively low, it was enough for a single young person to essentially say ""FU"" to work and pursue something new.  Money doesn't give you happiness but it does give you choices and hopefully you can choose to pursue the life you want.

Have any of you similarly seen really divergent financial lives from people with similar backgrounds? How has your family/community shaped your FIRE journey? What have you seen to be people's biggest obstacles in reaching their ideal life (whether that involves FIRE or not)?

EDIT: I am sibling 2, but you all seem to love sibling 3 a lot haha!",financialindependence
1065,Bankruptcy-proofing your assets. Why don't we talk about it?,,725,82fk72,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/82fk72/bankruptcyproofing_your_assets_why_dont_we_talk/,1520347503.0,"For some reason we don't appear to ever talk about this here.  But there's a tactic called bankruptcy that can obviously save your butt amidst unforeseen financial trouble.  

Did you know that roughly 1 million Americans file for bankruptcy each year?  Its not as uncommon as it may seem.  And from my research, not very expensive, and relatively simple process.

Reasons you might file for bankruptcy:

Lots of medical debt.  With insurance deductibles rising higher and higher this appears to be the number one reason people file bankruptcy.  Some of you advocate for budgeting absurd amounts toward medical expenses (probably wise to do.)  Bankruptcy can wipe away the medical debt.

Lawsuits.  Wage garnishment, and the whole nine yards can be wiped clean.  Umbrella insurance is a great hedge.  But don't forget about bankruptcy. 

Losing your job.  It happens, remember 2009?  If your assets are bankruptcy proof then there's an additional option.  

Divorce.  Yes, it happens alot.

Unexpected expenses.  We just don't know what the future holds for us.

My personal goal is that 90% or more of my NW is locked into bankruptcy proof assets - home equity, 401k's, IRA's, HSA's, 529's, etc.

You could potentially have 1 million dollars in 401k's and a paid off house and be able to keep 100% of it even amidst filing bankruptcy and wiping away any debt you owe.

Am I missing something?

I know bankruptcy is an odd thing to talk about in a Financial Independence sub.  But I can't help but view it as a fantastic last resort option.

I would love to hear your thoughts! ",financialindependence
1066,Has anyone actually coast fired?,,720,hzkxb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hzkxb6/has_anyone_actually_coast_fired/,1595963685.0,"My original post was taken down, so I am altering it in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation or some relevant advice. 

I’m a gym owner who is currently closed due to the pandemic. 

Pre-pandemic, my wife and I were bringing in $300k per year, for the last couple of years, through our gym (training). I have steadily grown my salary from $100k, over the past ten years. This did not come without cost; it cost me my sanity and almost cost our marriage. Quite frankly, anxiety and an unhealthy obsession with earning more is what pushed me to that income (my wife joined me as part of the business a few years ago). The day before the pandemic hit, I was on the verge of my tenth mental breakdown. 

We have just over $1 million in index funds. 
We have three years of living expenses saved. 

I understand I can most likely coast. If $1 million doubled in ten years, we could coast until then and reevaluate/FIRE. 

My dilemma is a mental one. Even in the current climate, once we can reopen, if I cut to part time, I can bring in far more income than I could if I started a new profession and worked 40 hours per week. We live in a low coast of living area. My wife could also go get a part time job and we can cover living expenses together. 

Problem is, I feel like a failure. I busted my ass for so many years to earn more and more and I feel my worth as a person comes from that success. Going backwards in salary makes me feel like I’m losing. The back of my mind says, “when you can reopen, bust your ass again and get your salary back up over the next couple of years. Earn big for five+ years and then fire early”.

36 years old and married; I’ve been saving before I even knew what FIRE is. We have approximately $950,000 in Fidelity between regular mutual funds. SEP IRA, and ROTH IRA. We also have a couple years living expenses in cash. We still owe approximately $80k on our house which has a market value just north of $200k. 

I’m a business owner who is depressed and miserable. My wife now works with me and she is equally as emotionally destroyed. Yes, I’ve saved, but I’ve lost my sanity and probably years off of my life in doing so. 

Our business has been closed since the mandated shutdown began and we’re collecting unemployment. You know what? We’ve never been happier! I can’t bear the thought of going back to my personal hell when this is over. 

I have two thoughts:

1. Go back to hell and keep trying to earn as much as possible with the goal of retiring in my 40’s. 

2. I think we’ve saved enough that even if we don’t contribute anymore, we could still potentially retire in 15 years. I’m considering cutting my business, to less than half, and working a part time schedule that covers living expenses. My wife could get a part time job elsewhere and bring in an extra amount that we could still put to savings. We could still potentially retire early; albeit, not as early, but we could keep our sanity. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and instead of trading peace of life for chasing more income they actually stepped back and were content to be OK as is?

* Vanguard Taxable accounts: 1.3m (mostly VTI)
* Savings: 100k (1.75% interest, will be reducing this amount shortly)
* Retirement accounts: 260k (mostly VTI)
* Home: 720k (paid off, no mortgage)

&#x200B;

My wife will continue to work since she enjoys the community aspect of going into the office.  It's also contract work, so she won't be devastated once the contract is up.  Our biggest takeaway has really been saving more than half of our income.  We maxed out our 401k, and then saved at least half of our base salaries, and 100% off all commissions and bonuses.

&#x200B;

We did make a few good decisions with real estate, including buying straight out of college near the school.  This allowed us to live well below our means the first 5 years out of school.  Many of our friends were still in grad school at the time so we could blend in with the crowd and not overspend.  By the time we were tired of living there, we rented out the home and bought our second closer to work.  This got us generating income from the rental while still heavily saving from our main jobs.  Once we sold those two homes, the appreciation and gross rental income accounted for 300k.

&#x200B;

Company stock also played a big hand.  I was able to ride it out with a tech startup and received a few payouts as investors changed hands.  We still would have gotten there without this, just not as high of amounts/home value.  It took a lot of grit to make it through those times and I'm glad to be off the ride.  There's really not a way to make the demanding requirements without sacrificing other life categories, and for me it was family (we chose not to have kids until later in life), friends, and health.

&#x200B;

We eventually shifted away from real estate and into index funds which is where we're heavily invested.  I realized that I'm not handy and didn't enjoy dealing with tenant complaints or with issues that arose.  Once our investments started making more than one of our base salaries for two straight years, I knew we were ready to pull the trigger.

Instead of learning some basic personal finance and creating sustainable lifestyle change they uproot their lives, burden their family so they can live rent free for a while and then complain how hard it is. It was incredibly unrelatable.  Where was the meaningful discussion on principles of index investing or a more detailed look at their expenditure. And all this talk of FIRE being some movement is so cringy.  Its just a cool concept that brings together some responsible personal finance and conscious consumerism.

Evidence of Income:

He is the top salesman in his company, inherited and now owns/runs a 60 acre beet farm/B&B and inherited another 1600 acre farm from his Aunt Shirley when she passed, bought and operates the Scranton office park. 

Evidence of Frugality:

Drives a 1986 TransAm during the entire shows run (2005-2013), wears cheap/presentable professional clothing, almost always packs his own lunch for work (and brings his own water), resourceful at home and work - digs his own ditches, slaughters his own meals. Was incredibly frugal managing the office park until Pam threatened to move: un-plied the toilet paper, put locks on the thermostats, added a revenue generating billboard. 

Has an F-U money mentality - resigned and went to work at Staples rather then having the office find out he was dating Angela. Curious that he didn't take any time-off if he had enough money, but was still willing to risk career for his moral stance


Evidence that he is not FI:

Has some expensive hobbies - paintball, weaponry, karate. Doesn't have kids but most likely supports Mose financially

Makes me think he was well on his way to FI if not there already. There must be countless other examples and some counter-examples.

Edit:

Dwight FI Quotes:

“Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.”

“It’s a real shame because studies have shown that more information gets passed through water cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage because I bring my own water to work.”

“Would I ever leave this company? Look, I’m all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I’m being paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued loyalty more highly… I’m going wherever they value loyalty the most.”

Channeling a MMM mentality?

“The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do this… Maybe they have something against living forever.”

“I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then, my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. Absolutely everything was the same…except I could fly.”

Side-Hustles:

“Now that I own the building I’m looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center? Muahahahahahahahaha…Well I guess it’s not an evil idea, it’s just a regular idea, but there’s no good laugh for a regular idea.”

But my experience over the holidays has made me rethink that.  I had time off over the past 3 weeks, and due to some circumstances, my wife and I spent it at home, without any family.  

It drove me crazy.  I found I could not easily relax and enjoy books or video games.  I picked up a bunch of projects around the house just so I could have something to do - something to make me feel *productive*.  Filling the days was something that began to stress me out.

Now I'm worried that my desire to stop working has been motivated more by ennui and dissatisfaction than it has by the desire to have more agency over my life.  Because, granted that agency, I didn't feel too good about it.

Don't get me wrong - I have taken long vacations before.  In fact, I was out of the country for 6 weeks this summer, traveling.  But the level of stimulation on such a trip is definitely higher than just spending time at home.

EDIT: I've thought about this some more.  I think the key issue for me is one of feeling productive.  I'm a 9-to-5er, and in my daily life, I have ample time to exercise, read, play video games, watch TV, hang with the wife and such.  One of my greatest joys these days is going hiking on Sundays.  I also manage to stay on top of a lot of housework, and get minor home repairs done.  However - during this 3 week period, I tried to expand all of these things to fit all my waking hours.  What this came at the expense of was the feeling of productivity - doing something, moving things forward, building, creating, removing entropy from the world.  More gaming and hiking and reading didn't help me with that.  Home improvement projects did, but there's a limit to my interest and expertise there.

So I think the core issue for me is that I need to find some hobbies that allow me to build and create, rather than just 'be'.",financialindependence

1:45PM, May 2nd - Rather fascinating update actually...I realized the model was assuming all contributions and expenses made throughout the year were accumulating return immediately, but this would not be the case in reality as they would be spread evenly throughout the year. I adjusted the formulas to account for this by multiplying all new contributions by half the return rate for the year added. This dropped the net worth at age 50 in the model from $2.054M to $2.004M, and from $3.503M to $3.420M at age 65, which is a great example of how even minor changes in the length of time one allows their investments to compound can have a material impact on long-term returns.

Obviously, the thoughtful folks on this sub are building the life they want to live. I consistently see articles like this in the popular media which is frustrating given that the FIRE philosophy is designed to avoid some of the traps detailed below.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------

Most people look forward to retirement, a reward for decades of hard work. But like many other pleasures, it may be bad for your health. It may even kill you.

How can that be? How can working longer be good for your health? After all, many people dream of—and plan for—retiring early. Strenuous, stressful work can wear people down and damage their health. On the other hand, retirees can relax and reinvigorate themselves. They have time to follow their passions and pursue activities that enrich their lives.

But in our rush to leave the office, we don’t realize that retirement also has a downside, especially over the long term. Many retirees indulge in unhealthy behaviors. They become sedentary and watch too much television. They eat too much. They drink too much. They smoke too much. Without the purpose of fulfilling work, retirees can feel adrift and become depressed. Without the camaraderie of their co-workers, retirees risk becoming socially isolated. Without the intellectual stimulation that work can provide, retirement can accelerate cognitive decline.

The problem for researchers is measuring which is the more powerful force—the joys of a more leisurely life or the downsides. An experimental study, in which researchers randomly force some workers to retire and others to remain in the labor force, would provide the best evidence, but that kind of experiment is impossible.

Instead, researchers have turned to statistical models that rely on factors that affect work but are unrelated to health—like Social Security eligibility ages, tax breaks for older workers or mandatory retirement rules. Researchers then can determine how health changes when these milestones are reached.

The result: Many of these studies clearly show that health problems intensify after workers qualify for retirement benefits and abate after policies encouraging work are introduced.

**MORE IN ENCORE**

## When you’re 62

Consider a 2018 [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272717302037?via=ihub&mod=article_inline) by Maria Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and Timothy Moore at the University of Melbourne, which used administrative data covering the entire U.S. adult population to examine how mortality rates change at age 62, when people can first begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits. After all, death is the definitive indicator of poor physical health, which itself is difficult to measure.

Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Moore found that men are 2% more likely to die in the month they turn 62 than in the previous month. This mortality surge is driven largely by increases in deaths from lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and risk factors for these conditions include smoking and lack of physical activity—both of which become more common when people retire. Mortality rates at age 62 increase less for women than men, and the relationship is not as clear-cut, perhaps because age-62 mortality is much lower for women.

## More evidence comes from looking at a Dutch policy change in 2009, which introduced a tax break for older workers. It provided workers a 5% bonus at age 62, a 7% bonus at 63, and a 10% bonus at 64. These incentives, which were eliminated in 2013, spurred work by men ages 62 to 64, and had smaller effects on women. Using this temporary policy innovation as a type of social experiment, Alice Zulkarnain and Matthew Rutledge at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College [concluded](https://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/?mod=article_inline) that delaying retirement reduced the five-year mortality risk for men in their early 60s by 32%. As in the U.S. study, the impact was smaller for women.

The evidence also suggests that retirement can accelerate cognitive decline. The mental exercise that work provides seems to keep people sharp. Learning new skills seems particularly important. By establishing “cognitive reserves,” such activities may help the brain become more adaptable and better compensate for age-related erosion in cognitive ability.

Economists Susann Rohwedder and Robert Willis used data spanning the U.S., England and 11 European countries to [show](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.1.119&mod=article_inline) that retirement significantly reduces cognitive function. When people retire, they typically get less mental exercise, because work activities are generally more cognitively stimulating than home activities. Retirees may routinely play bridge or do crossword puzzles, but that isn’t as intellectually challenging as many jobs. A 2014 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791704?mod=article_inline) of half a million retired self-employed workers in France found that dementia was significantly less common among those who retired later than those who retired earlier.

## The social network

Another risk for retirees is that leaving the workforce can cause them to be socially isolated. Most workers interact extensively with their colleagues, providing camaraderie and often social support. Although you would think that retirement provides people with additional time to nurture social ties, Eleonora Patacchini at Cornell University and Gary Engelhardt at Syracuse University [found](https://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/work-retirement-and-social-networks-at-older-ages/?mod=article_inline) that retirement *shrinks* social networks and the frequency of social interactions. The impact is especially large for women and college graduates. Smaller social networks and social isolation tend to reduce life satisfaction and impair physical and mental health.

It’s important to point out that a paying job isn’t always necessary to reap the health benefits of work. About one-third of Americans age 55 and older regularly volunteer for community groups and other organizations. Such unpaid activities can involve levels of physical, cognitive and social engagement similar to those in paid employment. Many studies, including a 2019 [evaluation](https://www.nationalservice.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/volunteering-helps-keep-seniors-healthy-new-study-suggests?mod=article_inline) of the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion programs, find that unpaid work, like paid work, reduces depression and loneliness and improves life satisfaction for older adults.

## These studies aren’t definitive. More research is needed to establish the pathways through which retirement affects health, and to identify which types of workers are most affected. For example, the health benefits of work aren’t generally shared by people with especially stressful, boring or physically demanding jobs. Workers in blue-collar jobs, for instance, accumulate health problems more rapidly as they age than workers in less physical jobs and usually experience health gains when they retire.

## Financial fitness

Retirement, meanwhile, doesn’t just threaten the physical and emotional well-being of people. In fact, perhaps the biggest downside of retirement is financial. Social Security replaces only about 40% of a typical paycheck. Employer pensions are much less common today than in the past, and relatively few people have saved enough in 401(k)s or elsewhere to guarantee a financially secure old age.

By staying on the job, workers can redeem their retirement prospects. Workers who extend their careers can save part of their additional earnings for retirement, and they can accumulate more Social Security credits. What’s more, retirement savings don’t have to last as long when workers delay retirement.

My Urban Institute colleagues Barbara Butrica, Karen Smith and Eugene Steuerle have [estimated](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement-0?mod=article_inline) that an additional year of work raises future annual retirement income by 9%, on average. The financial benefits from continued work are even greater for low-income workers because Social Security’s progressive benefit formula replaces a higher share of earnings for low-wage workers than high-wage workers. The bottom fifth of earners gain, on average, 16% by working an additional year.

The good news is that many older Americans are working longer. For much of the second half of the 20th century, the average retirement age for men declined steadily, as expanded employer pensions and the introduction of Medicare and early Social Security benefits made early retirement increasingly affordable. Between 1950 and 1993, the share of 65-year-old men participating in the labor force plunged from 69% to 28%. But the trend then reversed, in response to declines in employer pensions and employer-provided retiree health insurance, increases in older adults’ educational attainment and changes in Social Security rules. By last year, the participation rate for 65-year-old men had rebounded to 46%.

The trends differ somewhat for women, reflecting changing norms about women’s work. Between 1950 and 1993, the participation rate for 65-year-old women edged up 5 percentage points, to 21%, as women of all ages moved into the labor force. The participation rate then surged to 35% in 2018.

Despite these gains, obstacles to work at older ages remain. One is psychological: Many people feel they *should* retire by a certain age (or earlier), because that is the way it has always been. We should be encouraging older workers to stay on the job for their own health.

What’s more, for many older workers the decision to leave a job is not their own. Instead, too many are [pushed out of their jobs](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-secure-employment-older-ages?mod=article_inline) before they are ready to retire, and end up struggling to find new work with comparable pay. Employers often seem reluctant to hire older workers, because of fears that they are too expensive, lack up-to-date skills, or will retire before employers can recoup the cost of hiring and training them.

Various policy changes could increase older workers’ employment. Federal law prohibiting age discrimination in the workplace could be strengthened after a 2009 Supreme Court decision made discrimination more difficult to prove. We could revamp our approach to education and training to prioritize lifelong learning so older workers can keep their skills up to date. And we could invest more in programs and benefits for older unemployed workers, who generally have trouble finding jobs and often stop looking.

By enabling more older workers to stay on the job, these reforms could benefit companies facing shortages of skilled workers. But it could do more than that. It could also save lives.",financialindependence

1080,No Financial Incentive to Becoming a Doctor vs. Engineer?,,703,b62skr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b62skr/no_financial_incentive_to_becoming_a_doctor_vs/,1553682498.0,"Hello FIRE community. I've been lurking here for a while and finally have a question I think is worth asking. My (24) fiancé (24) has spent most of her life with the desire to be a doctor. She pursued a BS and MS in Biomedical Engineering and is finishing an MS in Global Health. She has reached the point at which she needs to make a decision on when and where to apply to medical school. This exercise has caused her to question whether she really wants to commit another 7-10 years in school and training to become a physician or if there is something else she can spend her time doing that would launch an equally fulfilling and meaningful (to her) career.

&#x200B;

I'm posting here because part of our discussion has revolved around what our home finances would look like over the next 10-15 years in the case that she pursues medicine or something else. We ran some quick numbers on what the opportunity cost between three options was:

A) Begin career now as an engineer

B) Start medical school in one year

C) Start medical school in five years

&#x200B;

Our assumptions were:

\- Starting engineering salary (Bay Area): $130,000

\- Starting physician salary (taken from average in her desired specialty in CA): $315,000

\- Medical school cost: $50,000 / year

\- Residency salary: $50,000

\- Wage growth rate: 3%

\- Investment rate of return: 7%

\- Average effective tax rate: 33%

&#x200B;

What surprised us is how similar her expected lifetime income between the three career options is. If she starts school in a year, being a doctor doesn't return more than a career in engineering until she is 49 years old. If she starts school in 5 years, that threshold moves to 60 years old.

&#x200B;

Her decision depends on much more than money - she is deciding what she wants to do with her life. But, the financial side is important and needs to be considered, which is why I'm posting here. Has anyone here had to make a similar decision? How did the financial aspect influence your decision making, particularly on your journey to financial independence?

&#x200B;

Edit:

Thank you all for your considerate responses! We really appreciate your perspectives. I've included some more information below to answer the questions that have been asked a few times.

&#x200B;

\- Financial compensation is not the only factor in her decision to be a doctor, but it certainly needs to be part of it, which is why we've consulted this community to find shared experiences.

\- Given our experience thus far in the Bay Area, I see the $130k engineering figure as very conservative. I understand these absurd salaries are a point of contention on this sub and frustrate people. It is a very strange bubble to be in, but we are trying to capitalize on it. I'm working in FAANG and she would be trying to join one of these companies. For reference, Google L3 or Apple ICT3 (new grad hire) ranges from $110-200k depending on overtime (many positions are hourly first 1-2 years). Google L4 or Apple ICT4 (next level up) ranges from $130-170k. Annual RSU refreshes vary a LOT, usually between $30-150k. This is my perspective which I'm sure is a jaded from mostly interacting with people in the same boat as me. Others can confirm or refute this assumption. Either way, there is definitely a chance she doesn't land a salary like that! So, I've re-done the spreadsheet to assume a total starting compensation of $110k. The break even points move to 46 and 50 years old. 

[https://imgur.com/a/Ll3PqiI](https://imgur.com/a/Ll3PqiI)

\- Someone asked a great question - are kids in our future? They definitely are! We'd like to start having kids around 30 years old. This is one of the other motivators that I wasn't going to touch on in this post, but might as well with all the feedback we're getting. If we want to have a few kids in our early 30s, the added financial stability of front loading her income will make living in the Bay Area trying to start a family more achievable. We're hoping her parents will eventually move in with us to help care for little kids, but that isn't a certainty. Child care is remarkably expensive here. As an anecdote, my co-worker who has 3 young kids pays $7k / month in child care. Needless to say, if she wasn't producing income during this time and her parents aren't able to move in, we'd either have to relocate and recalibrate with new incomes and expenses or reduce our savings rate to near zero (yikes). There is also the important consideration that having kids while being a resident will be very challenging and if her parent's arn't available to help, I would likely need to reduce my work time input to allow more time for the kids while she pursues her career as a doctor.

\- There have been several comments about the engineering salaries later in her career being really high. I understand the numbers look big, but they need to be taken in perspective with the timeframe we're talking about. A $300,000 income for an engineer seems insane! But 30 year from now it will not. A $100,000 salary would have also looked insane 30 years ago. The assumed wage growth rate of 3% is just outpacing inflation and I hope she would be getting some promotions on top of that! This is the compounding math we use in FIRE predictions working in reverse, come on guys!

\- I've seen comments going both ways on the assumed medical salary. We don't have great insight into this and there doesn't seem to be a lot of confidence in future medical salary projections. This assumption is for an OBGYN in California. We could be wildly off in either direction!

&#x200B;

Again, thank you all for taking the time to respond and give us your feedback. We really appreciate it!

13 years later, I hit half a million in Net Worth, and I just bought my first investment property! (I will close on it in February)

https://imgur.com/a/aPsYg

Edit: I've had a few PM's and enough people ask what I did to achieve this.

Quite frankly, I treated debt like it was a plague.  I didn't get my first credit card until I was in my early 20's, and I've *never* carried a balance.  I never went to college, so I have no college debt. (This is probably a major factor in my success.)  I'm not going to knock college education, and I don't want anyone thinking that not going to college is the way to get this kind of money, but it was a major contributor to my success.  Not having a college debt, and just working hard and learning in a computer technical field (one of the few fields where college used to not matter as much unless you were a programmer) contributed to my success.  I focused on scripting languages, and became so good at them, that I built automated systems for companies.  
*I want to be clear on this.*  Experts say college degrees are still the best way to get ahead financially in life, and that people with solid degrees will ultimately do better than those of us without.  However, there is some merit in ""the plumber, the carpenter, the handyman"" and those types of jobs, where no college degree was ever had, but they build success on their own.  I think a lot of kids overlook these types of trades, and I've seen my share of very very successful people.  I also think sometimes carrying a college debt, and not nailing a great job as soon as you step out of college can be depressing, and this may impact performance in a work place.  I have no idea, but the experts say otherwise, so I trust them.  In the end, with compounding interest, there could be an argument that unless you get out of college with $X amount in salary versus $Y debt, it may take you years to catch a person who never went to college, with no debt.  It's like the math problem of an 18 year old investing $5000/year into the market from 18 until 23 years old, and then NEVER invests again, versus a 23 year old starting to invest $5000/year into the market at the same growth rate.  Go do the math.  Go see how many years and how much money it takes the 23 year old to invest to finally catch the investments of the 18 year old!  It's a fun math problem to do, and it's one of the biggest inspirations I've ever had.  Go teach your kids this problem too!

Simply put, I focused hard on system automation, and was very good at it.  This landed me side by side with ""degree'd"" engineers, earning the same amount of money as them, but without the debt of college. 

As far as investments are concerned, I started investing 12% into my 401k early on, and I invested heavily in Latin America stock, mostly PBR (go look it up).  PBR was also a luck factor, because it skyrocketed before the 2008 crash, and I (innocently and luckily) got out of it about 6 months before the crash.  I had no clue what I was doing in those days, and was just looking up stocks that had massive returns because I was stupid.  (Today I'm mostly in stable tech companies like MSFT and ORCL.)  Anyways, that massive boost early on from PBR really got my investments going ridiculously early, up to something like 60k in the first 2 years.  I also bought National City (the bank) just before they were bought by PNC, and that bump helped a little.  I really fumbled through stocks, dangerously in those days.  That helped me build up a small but decent net worth early.  I eventually moved to the ""100% - age"" model, and put a percentage of my funds into low volatility bonds based on my age.  At some point, I also increased my paycheck contribution to 14%, and never looked back.   

Why do I have so much cash?  I just completed a contract, and that cash is going towards that investment property I mentioned above, so it's not going to remain as such. 

I also dumped heavily into TSLA back when it was around $100/share. (Yes.. I know all you 'savvy' folks, I know), but TSLA really gave me a boost as well.  I've since sold out of it mostly, but I still hold some shares ""just in case"". 

But if I were to name the single thing I've done to help boost my net worth so effectively, it would be paying down debt.  You lose SO MUCH MONEY to interest.  I paid down my house with GOBS of extra cash on principal every month, and did a 15-year finance, instead of a 30-year.  I also bought a house in what is now luckily a growing area, and I didn't buy a very big house.  ""Experiences, not things"" is my motto to live by. So we try to not buy too many things, and that allows us to save for events, and the rest of the cash goes towards debts.    

The next goal is to close on this investment property, and begin the potentially risky venture into being a landlord on the side.  The area the house is in is in an area with one of the best elementary schools in the state, so the goal is to cater to young families that want their kids in that school.  I was able to negotiate a great deal on the property, and pull in a very low interest rate (for an investment property.. 4.5%), by putting 25% down on it.  (Part of that cash I mentioned earlier.)  

At this point, I simply watch the market for major ups and downs as a signal for collapse.  They say you can't predict the market, but I did a couple of times based on (probably stupid) ideas, like when China crashed hard in 2015, I pulled out of the U.S. market because I firmly believe these things do not happen in a vaccuum.  Sure enough, our market dropped 10% (go look at .DJI on google finance), and I got back in.  Things like that have helped give me boosts here and there.  But at the end of the day, contribute as much as you can stand to the market, live in a smaller home, carry as little debt as you can, and before you know it, your money will be growing.  That's really it.  From where I'm standing, it's honestly nothing special.  No magic formula, no major number crunching, just consistency.  I don't ""want"" things very much, so I don't give in to many temptations. ",financialindependence

In the example that's on there, an individual has $60,000 in a loan (perhaps a student loan) with 6% interest and a 20 year term.

By making a lump sum payment of $6000 they have in a savings account from working throughout college, and then deciding to put another $150 towards their loan each month, the sheet gives you a summary of what you'd be saving in this scenario.

In this case: - Saving ~$20,000 in interest - Paying off their loan in 11.8 years instead of 20.

This is a pretty primitive sheet that isn't really programmed to fit every conceivable situation. It's also not the most user friendly if you aren't familiar with using spreadsheets.

1089,Oversaving in a 529 is a much smaller problem than you would think,,701,hqexle,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hqexle/oversaving_in_a_529_is_a_much_smaller_problem/,1594645658.0,"It's a discussion we have periodically - some people are paranoid about the penalties if you oversave in a 529 and then it turns out your kid doesn't go to college, or goes to a cheap college, or any other circumstance you don't need some or all of the money for education. So they advocate for saving in a taxable account instead. 

What are the differences? Well, there's two big ones. Some states offer a tax credit for 529s, though many don't. In addition, in a taxable account, you have tax drag on dividends, and in a 529 you don't. I wanted to see exactly how big the difference was between the final, post-tax amounts, for the two accounts in the scenarios when 0%, 33%, and 100% of the saved amount was qualified expenses. Math is run just for a few representative west coast states. NV/WA stand in for states without an income tax. AZ and OR have moderate and high state income tax respectively - with a small tax credit that somewhat makes up for it. CA has no tax credit, high income tax, and an extra penalty for non-qualified distributions.

Assumptions here:

1) We have a high-earning couple (I picked tax brackets for a couple earning ~$200k, as that's not *that* unusual on this sub) that maxes out all other tax-advantaged accounts, thus the only options for college savings are 529 or a taxable account

2) They save $10k/year at the beginning of the year from birth until age 18. For states that offer a tax break/tax credit, our enterprising couple puts the full amount of the tax credit into the 529 along with the $10k (that is, if given a $300 credit, they put $10,300 in each year). I picked this as a fairly large # so that differences would be easier to see - but proportionally the biggest benefit to the 529 is actually going to be just enough to max the state tax credit ($4000 for AZ, $6000 for OR). For states without a tax credit, it is identical proportional benefit no matter the contribution as long as the tax brackets don't change.

3) Growth is 7%/year of which 2% is dividends. In the taxable account, dividends are taxed at 15% plus their state tax bracket. In the 529, dividends are untaxed.

4) Penalties on non-qualified withdrawals are the income tax rate plus 10% in every state except CA - which adds an extra 2.5%.

5) It's assumed that tax brackets are unchanged in real terms moving forward. Obviously this likely won't be the case for the next 18 years - but how that affects capital gains vs income taxes on state and federal levels is anyones guess.

6) To make the math easier, I ignored the growth from age 18 till the end of withdrawal, with the assumption that all of balance would be withdrawn at the current marginal tax rate and given to the kid regardless during/after that period.

All numbers in thousands (except the tax break, which is really just $180 or $300)

||Tax savings up front from $10k/year contribution|Capital Gains Tax Rate (fed+state) for couple making $200k|Marginal Income Tax Rate|Balance in 529 after 18 years|Balance in taxable account after 18 years|Post-tax taxable amount|529 if everything is penalized|529 if a third is penalized|What % must be qualified for 529 to equal taxable account|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|NV/WA|$0|15%|24.00%|$363.79|$352.49|$334.85|$301.30|$342.96|54%|
|AZ|$180|19.24%|28.24%|$370.34|$349.36|$327.28|$298.79|$346.49|40%|
|OR|$300|24.90%|33.90%|$374.70|$345.24|$317.57|$291.60|$347.00|31%|
|CA|$0|24.30%|33.30%|$363.79|$345.67|$318.58|$279.61|$335.73|46%|

So to read the table, our couple saves $363-$375k in a 529 or $345-$352k in a taxable account, with the biggest difference being the tax drag in the taxable account. But post-tax, the taxable accounts only contain $317-$334k - due to capital gains taxes. The full 529 balance is available for education. But what about if it's withdrawn entirely for non-education reasons? Well, after taxes and penalties, it's only 
worth $279-301k. But even if only two thirds of the 529 money is used for educational expenses - in all cases, it's more final post-tax money than the taxable account. In fact, with some simple algebra, we can derive that as little of 31-54% of the pot of money being used for a qualified expense is enough for the 529 to beat the taxable account overall.

So is it better to not oversave in the 529? Absolutely. It's better to have the exact right amount in the 529, not have to pull any from taxable, and put all the extra in taxable. But if there's even a 50/50 chance that you're undersaving, the math works out that it's better to have that extra dollar for the kid in a 529 than a taxable account. The benefits of the loss of tax drag are just that important.

And yes, even if you *completely* oversave in this scenario and use *none* of the money for qualified expenses - you might lose ~10% of the overall balance (taking into account both benefits and penalties) - but I think the potential 10-15% benefit (if it's all qualified) outweigh that risk.

Note: I made a copy of the spreadsheet I used to generate the above [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10HRCc8Ggg1ai6gFtZiLCWeBC8WAz93svqW083LZDyoI/edit?usp=sharing). You're welcome to download it and use the generalizable calculator for your own scenarios, including lower tax rates and contribution #s. Outside of the tax credits, the 529 benefits tend to be much smaller for people who aren't fairly high earners, especially if your capital gains tax rate is 0. Honestly, if someone is in the 0% capital gains tax bracket, I don't think 529 contributions higher than enough to earn any applicable state credits would be worth it.

Edit: streamlined the table a bit to try to make it more likely to fit.

Edit 2: Major hat tip to /u/App1eEater who [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hqexle/oversaving_in_a_529_is_a_much_smaller_problem/fxzuuvv/?context=3) that I over-estimated the penalties for the 529 if the distributions are paid directly to the beneficiary - the penalties in that scenario are assessed at *the childs* income tax rate, not the parents. That makes the 529 an even better deal! I'm not redoing the spreadsheet to take that into account now (too much work), but yeah... it basically means the taxable account almost always loses, and it loses badly.",financialindependence

I was in my last month of residency and my wife was about to complete her 2nd year of residency. We never had any retirement accounts at the time since we felt too poor with our tiny residency salaries (we live HCOL, inside Boston) and our crushing student loan burden. So, a year ago, we had ZERO investments, and 317K in student loan debt. Net worth of -317K.

Well yesterday was a huge milestone for us - we crushed her student loans. Paid off all of her 106K loans in a single year's time!

**Summary from June 2017 to June 2018:**

401K/IRA/HSA/403B contributions plus 1 year of growth: 122756.96

Total amount of wife's loans paid in the past year: 106250.78 (remaining amount: ZERO [https://imgur.com/a/2MAjcLt](https://imgur.com/a/2MAjcLt) )

Yeah...somewhat depressingly, our networth is still negative, and we paid well over 100K in taxes in the past year....but still, we're excited, we're only 28 years old, and once my wife finishes her training we estimate our household income to grow to well over 600K which will give another boost to our FIRE plans!",financialindependence

It is often asked, ""What if Vanguard goes bust?"" The hypothetical answer to the hypothetical question is ""your investments are still ok.""  For example:


[https://www.mymoneyblog.com/what-if-vanguard-or-fidelity-went-bankrupt.html](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/what-if-vanguard-or-fidelity-went-bankrupt.html)

This [scenario](https://www.vanguard.com.hk/portal/mvc/loadImage?country=HK&docId=30627) is happening in Hong Kong. 





Basically, Vanguard will leave the Hong Kong market and relocate to Shanghai. It is [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/a66bf3ee-8a98-4eea-ac17-f65c35581d02) that Vanguard's assets will either be acquired or simply terminated.





In fact, Bank of Montreal ETFs are also reportedly leaving Hong Kong, and their funds may be acquired by China AMC.


So I guess it's true that people's assests haven't turned into toilet paper or worse. But now that the funds may have different managers, the investment approach could become very different. Mangagement costs may increase. So the risk is there but more hidden.


Sadly, the remaining global broad market ETFs in Hong Kong have very low volume and small in size.  IMO that's a higher risk. You would feel sad that investors in the city have not much options for global broad market ETFs.

1092,A huge thank you to the FIRE community for saving me.,,702,beqxtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/beqxtq/a_huge_thank_you_to_the_fire_community_for_saving/,1555622657.0,"Two years ago I was 22-years-old in university with $500 in my bank account. I didn't even own a car, and rode a bicycle to my university, home, the grocery store. The state I live in tends to get very hot all year round with temperatures reaching 110+ during the summer.

After graduating and four months into my first job making $60,000 in a mid-cost of living city (I work in IT) I bought my first house with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. I rented out two rooms and lived practically for free with my tenants paying my mortgage - this was all at the advice of my dad. I hated being a landlord - at least a landlord that lived with their tenants. So after I fixed up the place and made repairs I sold the house for a great profit (lived there less than a year). At the time I didn't know anything about FIRE - if I did I probably would have continued house hacking.

This is when I was about to make a terrible mistake. I had never seen so much money before in one check (roughly $30,000) and wanted to buy a Japanese luxury car in cash with my newly earned profits. I asked around in throwaway accounts (I asked while sitting at the showroom floor of the dealership) on /r/personalfinance and /r/cars whether this was a good idea and got the go ahead from lots of people - I was already aware of the idea of living below your means and had saved up $65,000 from my job, selling the house, rent money, and other side gigs (I'm a professional model and provide consulting). There was one comment all the way at the bottom though that only had 1 upvote and they mentioned not to purchase the car while referencing /r/financialindependence - I asked on this sub and besides major downvotes - I got a big clear no. That's when I started researching what FIRE was all about and why everyone was against the idea of such expenses. 

That's when I made the decision not to proceed with the purchase. I had given the Finance Director my cashiers check and asked for it back. They tried very hard to convince me to buy the car because it was a sweet deal and they couldn't guarantee that someone else wouldn't buy it. It was very hard saying no because I had always dreamed of owning a car, and to be able to purchase a luxury car was a dream come true. When I was in college I would bicycle everywhere: to class, home, the grocery store so to be sitting there with the money was a dream come true, but, I said no. I realized I was only purchasing the car as a status symbol to impress people who didn't give two shits. I was jeopardizing my future retirement by blowing this money all for nothing - it wasn't worth it.

After reading several personal finance books and FIRE blogs, I have since opened an online high yield savings account and brokerage accounts. 

Today, this is what my portfolio looks like:

Vanguard non-retirement brokerage account:

VTSAX: $62,952

VTIAX: $3,623

Vanguard Roth IRA:

VTSAX: $11,915

Fidelity Employer Sponsored 401(k) - my company matches 8% if I put in 4%. But I max out my 401(k).

401(k) 2060 Target Fund: $5,011

Marcus High Yield Savings Account: $20,500

Chase Checking: $3,500

Robinhood: $1,021

Today at 24-years-old I have over $100,000 to my net worth. I drive my parents hand me down $2,000 Toyota Camry and pay them $500 rent monthly. If you were to see me in person, I look like I'm worth $500, just like when I was in university. I invest every dollar I can into stocks. I still ride my bicycle now voluntarily from time to time and I couldn't be happier with my decision. That luxury car I wanted to purchase was sold hours after I left the dealership and I hope the new owner can really afford it and is enjoying it. Me, I've got higher priorities now - and that is pursuing FIRE and pursuing my other hobbies and passions. 

Thank you /r/financialindependence from saving me from making a terrible decision. I hope someone else about to make a terrible financial decision reads this post and is inspired to instead ask themselves if making this purchase will truly make them happy. I know my answer was no.

&#x200B;

Background: When my wife I got married we were over $250,000 in debt (mortgage, student loans, car loans). We got into Dave Ramsey around 26 and I discovered FIRE about 3 years ago. I read all the blogs, listened to pod casts daily, and bought tons of financial books.  I was checking my accounts using an app every few days, my wife and I were eating rice and beans. I was glad we turned our finances around but the stress of massive debt morphed into stress that my early retirement goals werent happening soon enough.

&#x200B;

But after awhile the information just seemed repetitive, and around the same time about a year ago my son was born. Ive been so busy changing diapers, cleaning bottles and doing all of the baby stuff that I just realized I havent checked my net worth in months.

&#x200B;

Having automatic deductions setup has been a blessing, it has allowed me to enjoy more important things in life all the while my money is working for me. Looking back I dont feel like checking my NW daily or constantly worrying about how to create side income or reduce my electric bill by 1% did all that much to improve my finances. Our budget isnt as tight as it has been in the past, obviously kids cost money to raise but we also pay for conviences we didnt in the past just because we have less free time. This will certainly add another year or two of working to hit our retirment number, but I think once you understand the core values of FIRE and get into a routine its best to take a step back and enjoy life, rather than get caught up in the stress of chasing wealth.

&#x200B;

Ill get off my soap box now, just thought I would share some quick thoughts with those new to FIRE. Ill check back in with y'all next year, hopefully with a NW north of three quarters of a million and maybe a new addition to the family.

&#x200B;

\~Spart

&#x200B;

EDIT: Sorry for the confusion. Many are correct that my NW at time of marriage was not negative $250k, instead we had $250k of outstanding debt in the form of a mortgage, two car loans and student loans. If you took libailities minus assets at that time our actualy networth was probably closer to -$50k since the home and cars could have been sold and repaid most of the loans.

I'm married with 2 children, work in a sales position which has been my career for most of my life, except for the 6 years I spent teaching English as a second language over seas. From reading the posts and advice in this sub I kept seeing the same advice over and over again: ""Pay off your debts, build an emergency fund, save like you're possessed.."" 

I hit a milestone this week. I had set up automatic payments on debts using my base salary, not taking into account commissions which I earn randomly throughout the year. I had maxed out what I could afford to pay on debts per paycheck and still pay the bills. This required a lot of sacrifice; from cutting out the weekly case of beer, to not going out for dinner more than once a month, to reducing random expenditures (ie coffee at a drivethru.) It's been about 2 years since I really started to get serious, with only the past year where I had a decent enough income to afford some real investments towards our finances. Starting with switching our credit card to a low-interest card, paying that, then our line of credit, as we have already paid off student debt in the last year. My most recent pay check afforded me the opportunity to drop the last $600 to pay off our last bit of credit, and go debt-free aside from our mortgage! 

I have a few friends (Canada) that have been bragging about how great of a return they've been getting on investing in weed corporations jumping on the green rush coming. I was so tempted to take a chunk of cash and invest it, but realistically it would have been a huge portion of our finances. 

We will be celebrating with a nice brunch at our favorite local restaurant today, and I had to post this to say THANK YOU FI!! Being subscribed to this sub and reading the random posts from others in a similar position celebrating their achievements it helped to keep me motivated and focused on realistic goals. We now have a net worth of about $80,000, with no debts, older vehicles paid off completely, equity in our home, and looking forward to the next goal of saving our 6 months emergency fund. I know I could have taken a short cut with a few investments, but I really wanted to stay focused on the proper steps before risking anything. 

I've read before ""don't invest what you can't afford to lose,"" with this in mind I haven't let myself get upset over missing some investment opportunities. Even if I could be a little further ahead with some high-risk investments, I am happy that we've followed our own plan and stuck to it. Thanks folks, can't wait to post our next milestone.

A little over a year ago something happened in my life that made me rethink my career choice. I'm not sure if the job was the problem, or the life event that got me down and started changing my outlook on life, but all I knew was I wanted a career change, and I wanted to work doing something I love or something that actually had meaning to me. The only problem is that almost every career I could think of that I would enjoy would pay out bare minimum. On the other hand, the things I like that are in demand and pay well(i.e. programming), I would most likely not enjoy because I would be working for someone else on a project I may not even care about.

A little while ago I read ""Growing the Money Tree"" by John Svazic and the intro alone gave inspiration. Many people try to strike it rich quick and fail and end up have to start from the beginning all over. But I don't want to be rich. I want enough money to live comfortably.

I last posted 6 weeks into my work-sanctioned sabbatical [when I observed that I left my depression and frustration at the door of my job](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6b56jp/wherever_you_go_there_you_are_a_small_observation/).


Updating six months in to say that everything has been even better than I could have anticipated and I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. I can't imagine going back to work in an office at this time. There's no downside to keeping my official sabbatical status intact until the end date, but I'll be spending the next six months trying to rustle up some basic income so I can continue this life with low stress, since I'm comfortably over ""Coast/Barista FI"" but below what I'd consider my comfortable FIRE number.


I've spent the last six months living out of my van (/r/vandwelling) with a small amount of international travel. I've seen amazing natural beauty, the exciting cities of west coast US and Canada, and met up with and been introduced to wonderful friends. This has also been a great way to keep expenses down, though I've spent a good amount more on eating out and other entertainment than anticipated since I'm visiting folks a lot and the default is often to go out. If I needed to keep expenses down more I could, but I'm lucky to be in a financial position of strength.


That has all been great fun, but I'm ready for another chapter - one that involves running water and a stable routine (with occasional van vacays). All I need to do is earn enough income to pay my basic expenses and I'm aiming to subsist on income + dividends without touching principal (ideally even saving more!) which means I'll end up with significantly more than I started with after enough time has elapsed (the current market has already put me in the strong position of having more money saved than when I started my sabbatical!).


In short, life is really, really good. If you're anything like me and have a healthy attraction to jumping out of your comfort zone and figuring out how to ""make it work"" - don't wait until you're fully FIRE to do so. There's so much out there for the taking in both experience and income earning opportunities. It's not worth it to toil away being miserable. The energy and enthusiasm I feel for life gives me full confidence that I can make this work - and my savings cushion and low expenses make it all the more achievable.


The Financial Independence lifestyle and community is the best thing to ever happen to me. Best of luck to you all, and don't wait to live your life!

1099,100% Stocks without bear market experience?,,694,6bacja,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6bacja/100_stocks_without_bear_market_experience/,1494854539.0,"We are now over 8 years in to a global bull market that has seen very few pullbacks over the entire duration.  With a CAGR of close to 15%, and a total return of approximately 300% since the March 2009 market bottom, a huge swath of new investors (including many on this sub) have not experienced what its like to live through a bear market (myself included).  

&nbsp;

Assuming most people here do not earn real wages until they are 22 (college graduate), you would at this point need to be 30 years of age to have even been in the working world during the tail end of the 2007-2009 GFC and subsequent bear market.  To have had any appreciable nest egg at that point under normal circumstances, you would have had to have been working for at least ~4-5 years before 2007, now we're at age 36-37.  Using the 2016 survey data as a guide, I'd say that no more than 20-25% of users were at an age that they would have personally felt the financial turmoil caused by a 16 month 50% draw down.  In fact, many popular bloggers that I follow (MMM, RoG, GCC, frugalwoods, madfientist, etc) did not fully experience the down turn either.

&nbsp;

Now with all of that history/speculation out of the way, I come to my point.  From reading this board over the last few years, I would wager that a huge amount of users are at or near 100% equities.  I am not suggesting this is a bad idea, I am just questioning the prudence of such a decision without the first-hand experience of a full on bear market.  It is one thing to claim that you will 'buy on the way down', 'not panic-sell', 'see it as a buying opportunity', etc.  It is another thing all together to actually stick to your plan while you are losing hundreds or thousands every day, for days, weeks, months on end.  I am sure that many investors pre-2000 and 2008 also told themselves these same things, before cashing out at the worst possible time, and staying out of the market for years.

&nbsp;

I would love to claim that I am going to act appropriately through the next down turn, but with no personal experience to back that up, I do not know for sure what my true risk tolerance is, or if I'll be able to put my money where my mouth is.  I started investing in August of 2013, so I personally have less than 4 years of market experience.  This fact certainly had an impact on my personal asset allocation, and why I choose to hold more bonds/cash than many others my age (currently 53% stocks, 34% bonds, 12% cash, with an AA target of 70/30 at 28 years old).

&nbsp;

I have read many past accounts of what it was like during 2007-2009, mostly from old bogleheads.org posts.  Some renditions are truly frightening.  Many lost their jobs, homes or half their portfolios (some all three).  The financial media was full of doom and gloom.  Article after article predicting further disaster, economical turmoil, uncertainty, etc.  You would have needed an iron stomach to stay the course.  Many were able to, to their credit, and were handsomely rewarded.  Many more were not so lucky.

&nbsp;

I would like to hear some responses from investors that have experienced major market down turns, be it 2008, 2000 or before.  What did it feel like?  How were you invested at the time?  What did you do?  I would also like to hear from those that fall into the younger crowd that are 90-100% equity.  How will you insure that you do not make unwise financial decisions when your portfolio loses 30, 40 or 50% over the course of a year or two?

As Larry Swedroe opines, everyone has their own individual need, ability and willingness to take risk.  In not so many words, I am asking you to justify yours.  Thank you all.",financialindependence
1100,UPDATE: Being retired while my future spouse works toward RE,,696,eom4uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eom4uz/update_being_retired_while_my_future_spouse_works/,1579012952.0,"Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cdhsr5/being\_retired\_while\_my\_future\_spouse\_works\_toward/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cdhsr5/being_retired_while_my_future_spouse_works_toward/)

Original Post TLDR: I \[35m 1.5MM NW\] and my fiancée \[35f 0 NW\] are engaged. I gained my net worth by working abroad in Bermuda (8% income tax), housing expenses covered, high salary, great USD to CAD exchange rate. I retired just before getting engaged and wanted to stay retired while my fiancée worked toward FIRE at her own speed.

Options at the time of post:

&#x200B;

1. Homemaker while covering expenses allowing fiancée to save her needed 1 MM for retirement, estimated time to FIRE 10 years.
2. Work on a gig/ part time basis until we save another 1MM estimated time to FIRE 7 years
3. Work with her in our current country (Canada) to save 1MM, estimated time to FIRE 5 years

It has been about half a year since my initial post and my fiancée and I have come to a pretty happy, unexpected solution. I offhandedly commented how it was too bad she didn’t work abroad while I did otherwise we could both easily be FIRE already. She responded asking why we don’t just do that now. That is when I realized she might be marrying an idiot. Most people I spoke to/worked with, hated the working abroad life and my fiancée never showed interest in it so I assumed that it was never an option for us. As I have worked abroad in the past I have an established network so I could help her with finding a job abroad. My fiancée and I have secured positions abroad (starting in March) and this should speed up our estimated time to FIRE to about 2 to 3 years. We have decided to push the wedding back until we are FIRE but more importantly no longer living abroad just to make wedding planning easier. In the end I could make peace with the fact that I could leave retirement for only 3 years and we could secure our future.

Total Compensation as a couple and VERY rough FIRE estimates:

350k USD

Rental expenses covered by employer

Absolute worst case scenario yearly expenses 80k per year (again housing is covered but VHCOL)

This should result in us saving 240k USD as a couple after taxes and expenses which translates to roughly 310k CAD.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have gotten multiple DMs asking how I got the first position abroad and how they can recreate this. Unfortunately my experience getting the job was uneventful as I simply googled ""actuarial recruiters bermuda"" and applied through recruiting agencies. If you are looking to work abroad similar to what I did my only advice is to find locations where your professions are well paid search for recruiters relating to your profession and the region you are looking for and apply. Alternatively you can always work in a multi national company within your home country and transfer internally. This is really the only advice I have for securing a position abroad as this is all I did.",financialindependence

Retirees draw $1.3T in income, 42% is from Social Security, 30% is from ""traditional retirement plans and pensions"".  I wish they mentioned how much of that 30% is pensions.  We can only guess that over 80% of current retirees income comes from pensions or Social Security.

1103,I had one of those moments this week - when you realize that FI-style living has given you greater freedom.,,688,605lq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/605lq0/i_had_one_of_those_moments_this_week_when_you/,1489862007.0,"This isn't one of those ""I just quit my job to travel the world and enjoy life"" posts.

Rather, it's a story about options- and how being confident and financially secure takes the stress out of what might be one of life's otherwise most stressful situations, and opens other doors.

Last year, I got the highest paying job so far of my career. Unfortunately, things hadn't been working out. I was enjoying the work a lot less than the type of projects I had worked on in the past. My workload was too light - and multiple talks to my bosses (I've had four in one year) never addressed anything... because each boss was only around a few months, tops. Meanwhile, there was a lot of other churn in my department. Aside from the bosses cycling, nine other employees around me were suddenly fired and replaced.

It was a weird time, and a weird place. I kept my head down, tried to stay content, and kept putting away the paychecks. I resolved to stay at least a full year, for various financial incentives.

A week ago from last Tuesday was my 1 year anniversary there. That Friday, I realized it wouldn't keep working. I had a talk with my current boss to tell him about some of my discontent, and see if we could address those problems. He told me that he could tell I was burnt out- and that if I wanted to stay there, I needed to be ""drinking the company kool-aid 100%"". It's a fast-paced environment and he needs employees to be fully on board. He asked me to promise I could do that. 

It was clear that having expressed any discontent was a Bad Thing, and if I didn't want to be in the next round of sudden layoffs, I had to radically alter to fit the company.

I thought about it for a few moments, and then told him ""I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not going to fit in with the culture here.""

He obviously wasn't expecting that response, and asked me what I was planning to do. I offered to work another four weeks, to see out the current project I was working on, and said that I'd give official notice with two weeks remaining.
He got back to me last Wednesday with a pre-approved deal from HR: I'd give three weeks' notice that day, exit in early April, with health insurance for the whole month, and they'd give me an extra week of severance pay.

Last week was productive. I'm already starting the interview process with two companies I would love to work for.

Thinking about how this went, compared to prior tail-end experiences with employers... it's incredible how easy a decision this was, and how easy the exit from the company is shaping up to be. 

Ultimately, I can attribute it to the way I've changed my life in the last few years. I've become more frugal, with low fixed costs. I'm not attached to my living situation (I was on a month to month lease), have few physical things tying me down, and I've saved a quarter-million in the bank (well, Vanguard, but you know what I mean). 

I still need a job. I'm not anywhere close to FI yet. 
But I can afford to make sure I have a job I enjoy, rather than one I hate, and I'm parting with this company on better terms than I had expected possible.

So, thank you/r/FI, for helping me to realize that this kind of self improvement was possible in the first place.",financialindependence
1104,One Year After FIRE,,681,8wmk2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8wmk2p/one_year_after_fire/,1530902341.0,"I retired a year ago after becoming financially independent. The retirement was due mostly to inheritance from my father, but also from my own frugality and saving over 50% of my salary. I'm not quite lean FIRE, but I'm not living large either.

Financially things have been fine. Last year the market was very nice, and my retirement accounts are up 6.2% despite having paid all of my bills for the entire year. I have a 70/30 stock/bond ratio with a variety of index funds (including broad indexes and international indexes) and a variety of bond funds. 5% out of the 70% is invested in a precious metals fund. There's also a generous emergency fund and 2 year CD chain. That's my main retirement account. My IRA and 401K are not alligned with that, but I'm putting off rebalancing those until next year. I rebalance the main account every three months.

I started out with a 3% withdrawl rate last year. But in a year of dealing with my own issues, I have become rather disturbed with the amount of self-hate I have. I began to see that my frugality is partly a way to punish myself, and I wanted to try to be nice to myself. With my 2018 budget I bumped it up to a 3.5% withdrawl rate. I find I have trouble spending the money. My frugality is also partly a realization that things will not make me happy (except maybe my motorcycle). But I am saving the ""fun"" money that I don't spend, and few times I've gone over budget on fun and had to pull from the savings. And maybe I'll travel more than I expected.

When I shifted up from 3% to 3.5% the question came to mind, ""When am I going to shift down?"" Now, the 3% and 3.5% are based on my initial balance at the start of retirement. If you look at my withdrawls compared to my current balance, the rate is 3.29%. The plan I came up with is that if my withdrawl rate based on my current balance ever gets up to 4%, I will adjust my budget based on my evaluation of my situation at that time. Maybe it's something that looks to be short term, and I can just soldier on through. Or maybe it's something that looks like a long term recession, and I will scale back my spending. There was a thought experiment on r/preppers about what you would do if you lost your job for six months. I wasn't worried because I have a six month emergency fund, but it made me think about how I could cut my budget. I think worst case I could get it down to 1.5%. It wouldn't be fun, but I could do it.

I had one big expense that was not planned for. The water heaters in my condo building have reached the end of their expected working life, and several have failed. Not wanting to pay for flooding my downstairs neighbor's unit, I replaced the water heater for $3,600. Previous repairs had only been a couple hundred a year, so I hadn't planned on this. Some of it came out of my emergency fund (which I paid back in a month of diverting other savings), and some of it came from my ""insurance"" savings. I figure that extended warranties are a scam if you can afford the repair or replacement. But I always ask how much they are. Then I put that much into a savings account, along with a small monthly amount equivalent to renter's insurance. It looks like I may have another one coming. I know an estate lawyer, and said he'd help me put together a will. But he's been dragging his feet about it all year, so I think I'm just going to pay someone to do it. I don't know what that will run, but I may just sell some extra stock to pay for it rather than fudging budget categories.

I think I'm still trying to figure out retirement. I have a tendency to push myself to be productive, but I push myself too hard and stress myself out. Nothing that I expect is unique, but there it is. So I'm not one of these people who has no idea what to do with themselves in retirement. I'm one of those people who has too many ideas about what to do with themselves in retirement. I'm trying to find a balance between working on the projects I am interested in and just taking it easy. That balance is elusive.

The projects I am working on include a large programming project that I've been fiddling with on and off for years. I've managed about 11,600 lines of code in the past year on that. When I first posted that I had FIREd, I mention an interest in charity work. Soon after that I went to a Quaker gathering that had a panel discussion on the school to prison pipeline. I did some more reading and became totally dumbfounded at how messed up and racist our criminal justice system is in the U.S. I am now volunteering with a charitable organization lobbying for criminal justice reform at the state level (the federal level is dead due to the insane power a few people have in our so-called democracy). I am also working more on my Zen practice. I finally found a local teacher in my tradition, and I am at the Zendo at least twice a week, some of it working towards a Jukai ceremony at the end of the year. Finally, I am working on exercising more. After having to watch my father's decline in his old age I am trying to be healthier so I can enjoy my retirement long term.

In terms of chilling out, I was sick for a month. I had a massive allergy attack, followed by a screw up with my long term medication, followed by another massive allergy attack. During the second attack there were four days where I got no more than an hour of sleep at a time because I was coughing so bad. It certainly was not fun being sick, but it was really nice to just be able to take a month and deal with it, and not worry about my job or much of anything else. I just did the bare minimum I needed to do, and if I had any energy left over I did want I wanted to do, and spent the rest of the time trying to take it easy so I could heal.

The biggest thing I've noticed in retirement was my [suicidal tendencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoF_a0-7xVQ). I have had long term depression since I was a little kid and tried to kill myself at age 10. When I was working at my old job, I was having suicidal ideation every week or two, and serious planning every three months or so. At one point I was eating so little I collapsed after walking up a couple flights of stairs. Due to my history with depression (I actually passed out from not eating once in high school, too) I just convinced myself it was normal for me. A month after I quit my job I was like, ""OMG, I haven't thought of killing myself once since I left work!"" My depression is still there, but it's been like crawling out of a sewer pipe into a cool rain on a warm summer's day. And not being distracted by work has given me more time to be with my depression, to understand it better, and to deal with it more effectively.

So here I am and there I go, and I look forward to finding out where I will turn up next.

Edit: I'm don't need therapy. I'm doing fine without it, in fact I'm doing better since I stopped therapy and started doing Zen. Don't worry about it.",financialindependence
1105,My first year of tracking my NW. Two years into FIRE. Modest income. Lucky human.,,681,dlk3tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dlk3tx/my_first_year_of_tracking_my_nw_two_years_into/,1571760642.0,"&#x200B;

Let me start by saying I am sorry if this breaks any rules in the sub. I’ve been here long enough to know it will be removed by the \*new-ish\* mod team if it does. Apologies in advance if that occurs.

**This IS your typical “I’m on my way to FIRE. Here’s where I’m at”** post. I’ve gone ahead and tried to add more detail but if you have no interest in **another mid twenties person** rehashing the last couple years of professional experience and a FIRE-minded approach to life then I would simply stop here.

I started college in Fall semester of 2013. I was 18 and went to a state university in the NE region. I was granted merit based scholarships as well some subsidies for tuition due to a program known as the [New England Regional Tuition](https://admissions.uconn.edu/cost-aid/tuition/rsp). Some of my college was subsidized by my achievements and due to my choice in the discipline. The other part of my college was completely paid for by my parents. I cannot stress this enough. While I was in Uni, I was lucky enough to have all of my necessities covered by my parents or other means. I did work as a sophomore up until I graduated (undergraduate lab where I was published as a #2 author, gas station), but literally pissed all that money away on alcohol and drugs. I really am very lucky and privileged. I got to enjoy all my college years and graduate with no debt. I **could** **not** have done this had my parents not helped me and given me so much. There just would’ve been no way for me to balance the workload (I went to school for ChemE..it was hard because I’m a pretty average guy)

Well fast forward to graduation of college. I’m out of school with no debt. Again, most of this success to this point has been a combination of (alittle) of my skills & drive, and (a lot) of my surrounding support system). By this time, it is May 2017. I’ve just received my diploma and drive back home to have knee surgery (woohoo ACL tears!). By August 2017, I had my first job after living at home for 3 months (recovering + job hunting). My pay would be almost $50k a year. Once I got a job offer my parents gave me **$10,000** to put towards whatever I wanted.

**OK. That’s the story before I really started my FIRE journey. A lot of privilege. A lot of luck in the genetic lottery. Absolutely amazing self-less parents who I would do anything for. A VERY strong support system.**

Cue the start of my own (I mean really, my OWN) journey.

In November of 2017 my parents would sell the house I grew up in and move out of state. I lived in their old house until I was forced to move out. In Nov 2017 I moved into my friends duplex. He had graduated a year prior and co-signed with his parents. Myself and another friend were renting out rooms on the first floor while he lived in the master. He also had tenants above him (kinda sounds like the start of his own FIRE journey :p). This is around the time I started realizing I’m starting to stack up some sizeable amounts of money. This is also around the time I first dove into investing, retirement planning, personal finance and the likes.

Until 2018, I just kept absorbing information without taking much action. I wanted to be sure of myself. I think I put like $3k into my 401k in 2017 but I’m not sure I’d have to look. So once 2018 began I took things more seriously. I applied more effort to handling my money. From about 2018 until now, I’ve followed a budget close to the one you will see below:

**Monthly Summary 2017-2018 (note: in 2019 the income rose to \~$4833/month, expense constant)**

Income - $4000 (gross)

401k -  $1550

Taxes + Other deductions – $894 (S/0)

Expenses - $1015

Taxable Brokerage - $166

Roth IRA - $500

Savings = $2216  ($26.5k/yr)

Spending + Deductions = $1784  ($21.4k/yr)

You’ll notice this is slightly off – approx. $225 / month in the red.. That is due to the following:

1. Spreadsheet and taxes + deductions were updated to current numbers once 2019 started (got a raise to $58k..so I probably paid less than $894 / month when I was making $48k
2. I (foolishly, I admit) claim nothing on my taxes and get $1500-$1700 back each year. Might change this since it’s an interest free loan to uncle sam blah blah whatever.

So all things considered lets be conservative and say maybe \~50% savings rate? I know numbers are a little funky but it’s hard to go into alllllll the details here. I also don’t stress about the fine details much because lets face it – there will be things well out of my control that happen and have a far greater impact than actually only putting $18,450 in my 401k in 2018. I do what makes sense for me. Hopefully there isn’t too much blowback from the accountants on this board.

Now comes my favorite part…The chart and current investment thoughts.

As I mentioned, I really started thinking about FIRE in Nov 2017, or that was my first formal exposure to the idea, anyway. That is reflected in the following chart, which begins in Oct 2018 and ends Oct 2019.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/Wt0YEkP](https://imgur.com/gallery/Wt0YEkP)

Really the only thing to note is that in 2019 I got a big raise (I said gimme or I’m gone..thanks to having a huge E-fund and safety net (the one I built, not the one I was born into). I made the jump from $48k to $58k and a got a nice bonus with backpay.

**Investment Thoughts:**

21% cash (declining every pay period)

79% invested (Bogle 3fund)

Of my investments:

68% 401k (US Total Market Fund)

21% Roth IRA (95% US Total Market funds + 5% lotto tickets)

11% Taxable Brokerage (\~85% US Index funds + 15% EX-US Index Funds)

I am working towards an 80/20 (equity/bond) ratio with \~20-40% international equity weight. I just decided on the asset allocation a short time ago, so my current investments don’t reflect my desired allocations. I will be working to amend that by simply increasing my international funds. I don’t think I’ll re balance into that AA at this time. Bonds won't really be added until next year, at 25. I don't plan to be 20% bonds until maybe 35-40.

In Oct 2020, I plan to make a similar post. If you read this whole thing, I hope you enjoyed it. I look forward to any comments and discussion.

&#x200B;

Edit: I've really enjoyed all of these discussions. I think there are some interesting opinions about privilege and how it applies to FIRE.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Here are some facts about my college experience. I feel I should update because there is some misinformation going around. So..

1) I did not attend UCONN! New England Regional Tuition was \~$12k per semester or $24k per year. I was granted a merit based scholarship for $5.5k per semster or $11k per year. Freshman year I paid the full room and board costs + meal plan which was $12k per year. After sophomore year, housing costs went down to $3k per semester. Food went down to \~$4k per semester. The following can be used to summarize college expenses. Please note these are estimates

2) My parents provided both my sister and I with $160k for educational costs. Much of that money was passed on to them from their grandparents. All 4 of my grandparents fought in WWII, survived to tell the story, and lived into their 90's. I have a suspicion that their money is much of what was used to pay for my schooling. I hope to do the same for my kids, and many others.

**Year 1:**

Tuition : $24k

Room + Board: $12k

Scholarships: ($11k)

**Year 2-4:**

Tuition : $24k per year

Room + Board (off campus housing + no meal plan just buying groceries) : $14k per year

Scholarships: $11k per year

**Total Estimated Cost of College: \~$106k.** 

**Total Savings Available For College (From Parents): $160k**",financialindependence

While the article isn't about FIRE, I feel that #1, 2 and 5 are the ones that align with my own personal feelings on reaching FI and hopefully getting to early retirement.  I hope that I won't have these regrets when my time comes.

**I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me**

This one feels especially relevant, since we're taking a path less traveled.  My wife and I could be living a life right now that is a lot more extravagant if we weren't putting away half of our gross income.   The few people who know about our plans don't really understand it, but that's OK.  It makes me think of the Dave Ramsey line about living like no one else. 

**I wish I hadn't worked so hard**

This is probably one of the main reasons for us to reach FI.  I think I would certainly have this regret if I ended up working into my mid to late 60s and found myself on my deathbed before I'd reached 80.  Reaching FI means our life no longer revolves around needing to work, and frees us to live the way we want to, not the way we need to.  As I get older, working harder becomes more of a requirement, as I have to make sure I remain more valuable than the younger people coming up behind me.  

**I wish that I had let myself be happier**

Again not totally FI related, but it's a question we ask each other on occasion, about what makes us happy, and trying to balance being happy now and still securing our happiness in the future.  I don't want to feel like saving for the future means I have to live a miserable life now, but at the same time trying to ensure that I won't have to live a miserable life 20 years from now.

1111,Year 2 update: Resident Physician to Attending Physician with 466k student loan debt,,681,977n17,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/977n17/year_2_update_resident_physician_to_attending/,1534247050.0,"[First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4m1ln3/resident_physician_with_400k_medschoolgrad_school)

[Year One update]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tfii3/1_year_update_resident_physician_to_attending)

Hello everyone, I figured I would do a yearly update and crosspost to both [PF](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/977kvx/year_2_update_resident_physician_to_attending/) and the FIRE subreddit. 

**THE DEBT**

Down to 362K as of today.

I ended up refinancing my loans to a private lender. I debated long and hard about continuing with PSLF, but in the end, the risks far outweighed the potential benefit. There was no guarantee that my loans would be forgiven, especially as my employer was not 501c3 certified. Even though it is considered a non-profit and provides public health services (it is an independent physician group and is not technically part of the hospital), there is nothing to prevent the government from denying the forgiveness claim.  I ended up refinancing to a 3.8% fixed rate loan for 6 years. However, I have been paying biweekly instead of monthly, and that has shaved off a significant time off of my payoff period. 

Deciding to refinance was one of the toughest financial decisions I made. It may be possible that I could have gotten my loans forgiven had I stuck with it, but I simply wasn’t willing to take the chance of my loans ballooning to a massive amount (my average interest rate for all my loans pre-refinancing was about 6.8%), and then finding out I didn’t qualify for PSLF. Ultimately, I feel better about paying off loans at a regular interval, and watching the total principle decrease. Although it’s easy for me to say I wish I had started paying off in residency, hindsight is 20/20 and what’s done is done. I’ve made the commitment to get rid of my loans, and to be honest, it feels like a dark cloud has started to lift knowing that they are finally being payed off. 

Again, I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.

**PERSONAL STUFF AND EXPENSES**

My car now has 130k miles, but I’m starting to feel the pull of lifestyle creep. I can’t help but constantly look up newer model cars, and think about how much better my 15min commute would be with heated/cooled seats. I follow Doug Demuro on YouTube, and wish I had a car worthy of being reviewed for it’s quirks and features. I'm still leaning hard towards a CPO Tesla!

I’ve decided to update my wardrobe once a year, but only around great sales. This year, Macy’s had a great deal around Veteran’s day, where they had an extra 20% off coupon. Ended up purchasing a ton of dress shirts, pants, and shoes for less than $300. I’m subscribed to /r/frugalmalefashion which is where I can keep an eye out for these deals. 

I reduced expenses:

* Again called my ISP and was able to keep my 50/10 internet for $30. My modem and router have paid for themselves, so again, no rental fees :)
* Ended up joining my brother’s family plan. Cost was an extra $18 to his plan, which I pay off. Over the last 2 years, I've reduced my cell phone bill from $75->$55->$20!
* Kept my Costco executive membership and am using their credit card.  This combo essentially pays for itself through the combined 4% cash back, as well as 4% off their gas (which is already about 20c cheaper than surrounding gas stations). 

**THE JOB**

Received a promotion, with a stipend attached to it. It’s a little more administrative than I thought, but it’s providing me with an opportunity to learn leadership skills. 

**THE BENEFITS/INVESTMENTS**

* 403(b): 18.5k fully maxed out last year. For 2018 and going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year. 
* Non-governmental 457: 18.5k fully maxed out last year. Again, for 2018 going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year.
* 401(a): employer contributed. Finally qualified this year!
* Roth IRA: $5500 fully funded the beginning of every year. I have basically been setting aside $211 every pay period so that I can fund at the beginning of next year. 
* Emergency fund: fully funded. Ended up closing out my Ally CDs early since their savings interest rate was more attractive than the CD. 
* Taxable brokerage accounts: I ended up keeping only the Vanguard account open. I haven’t really been contributing as I have been saving up to purchase a home in the area. I do have 2 individual stocks I purchased near the end of last year which have done reasonably well. I’m a fan of index funds, but these 2 were “fun” stocks to play around with. 
* Cryptocurrency: I really wish I wasn’t greedy or had FOMO syndrome. I could have made a small profit had I sold at the peak. Instead, I only have about 25% of my original investment left. My only saving grace is that I did not pour too much into this, and can absorb the losses. Do I truly regret it, though? Not really…I was thankfully reserved enough not to invest too heavy, and I can treat it as a lesson learned (albeit a pricey one). 

**NET WORTH**

* Since I started calculating this in October of last year, my net worth has gone from -$311k to -$170k. Using excel’s trendline tool, I’m expecting to hit net 0 in September 2019. 

Here’s a [visual](https://imgur.com/a/tsD3VUi) of my net worth, debt load, and investment value since I started tracking in October 2017.


**THE PLAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR**

1.	Continue to max out 403b, 457, and backdoor Roth IRA. Once I save up 20% for a down payment, I’ll restart m contributions to the taxable brokerage account.  
2.	Continue to pay off student loans regularly. Currently I have under 5 years left on my loan repayments (I have been paying a little extra every month in addition to making biweekly payments). Having an auto-debit from my banking account has done a lot to ease my mind. Any extra cash I make will be used to pay off loans. 
3.	Continue contributing to nephew and niece college funds.  
4.	Since I have started making massive student loan repayments, I have been able to avoid lifestyle creep simply because I don’t have the money to do so. That being said, although I still live like a resident, I don't have to live like a hermit. I was able to afford a vacation abroad this past year, I continue to have dinners and drinks with friends, and am still able to afford the occasional nice bottle of Japanese whiskey once every few months.

1113,A Nurses Perspective....,,675,i5stog,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/i5stog/a_nurses_perspective/,1596860234.0,"30yr F. I put myself through nursing school (my second degree), both paid for in cash and have been a Nurse for two years now. I have barely six figures in savings (large majority in retirement). Ive never had any debt and my goal is to be financially independent by 35. Its really just an arbitrary number at this point but Ill explain.

Paying cash for both degrees was because I never even saw loans as an option I would accept. And I worked my fucking ass off to do it. I live off of $24k a year and the rest is in investments. In May of this year I quit my full time critical care, HIGH STRESS but high paying job. I landed a part time position at my previous employer but took a massive pay cut to do it. But still make more than enough. 

This year has destroyed me. Emotionally and mentally. Im just so fucking done. My plan was to just ""tough it out"" at the hospital for a few more years (the high stress job I quit) because the money was good. But your girl is tired! Ive worked so hard to put myself in the situation that Im in. Being able to tell the job I hate to fuck off because I can was the most powerful feeling in the world. 

Now, Im living a much more manageable lifestyle (stress wise) but the money will not get me to FIRE by 35. Part of me thinks that I deserve to lay low right now, I earned it. The other part of me hates myself because Im just being a princess and not wanting to bust my ass anymore. But isnt that what FIRE is all about as well? 

Ive seen some seriously fucked up shit in the hospital. And every time I did it would make me want to quit even more. Not because I couldnt ""handle"" it but because I knew I didnt need the money so why was I even working a job I fucking hate when Im not even guaranteed tomorrow. 

I seriously thought nursing would help my FIRE but now I just want to live my life how I want NOW. And not in however long it takes me to get there.

I knew he was leaving the company soon, so I asked him where he was going next, just making small talk. He said ""actually, I'm retiring.""

Turns out he's 48 years old and got into FIRE about 7 or 8 years ago when he got married - his spouse got them to save 50% of their income, and now he's done. He started telling me about the whole FIRE concept and I said ""oh, I'm well aware, I'm going the same route myself"" and we chatted about blogs we like to read, etc. etc.

I don't really talk about FIRE much at work, so it was a pretty cool random run-in with someone else who was not just going after the same goal, but who had reached it. The project manager, who is mid-20s, said something after the call like ""can we just talk about <VP> retiring at 48 and not thinking it's weird?"" and so we got to talking about FIRE as well - turns out she's already more than maxing her 401k, so a good start, and I pointed her at this sub and a few other resources. She now seems super into the idea, which is also neat.

1115,Passing on some fatherly wisdom.,,680,7ou2aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7ou2aw/passing_on_some_fatherly_wisdom/,1515365670.0,"Long time lurker here, my father dropped some insights on me today about his journey towards financial independence and the mistakes he made on the way and I felt I should summarize and share. 
___

A little background

My father came from a low income, paycheck to paycheck family. He watched both his parents work soul sapping jobs for measly pay and vowed he wouldn't live that way.   
He worked hard/made some smart decisions and reached financial independence in his early 30s and retired at 45 (He is 56 now). 
___
Sound like the poster child for financial independence right?

I thought so too but today he confided in me that he is unhappy and wishes he had done things differently. He worked hard to reach FI but felt he missed out on the prime decade of his life in the process. 

He gave me two guidelines to prevent his mistakes:

(Note: These guidelines actually run contrary to a lot of the wisdom on this sub but bear with me, it's not about throwing FI out the window it is more about leading a more balanced life.)

1) **Everyday be doing something that makes you smile or be thinking about something that makes you smile.** 

Some people love what they do for a living and that's great but most people don't. We spend a huge portion of our lives working, even if we do reach RE, and it doesn't make sense to to subject ourselves to misery today in order to reach happiness tomorrow. 

So, 

Do something that makes you smile everyday: If you hate your job and could be doing something you love, do it, even if this means earning less and postponing FI/RE. But, if you can't be doing something you love, which is the reality for many that's okay too. You still have to do something that makes you smile though. How you do this is up to you, it could mean saying fuck it and taking a sick day to go on a road trip with some buddies even if it means you can't save up as much this month.

Reality is different though, we all have rainy days or days we just have to grind and get the unpleasant things done. This however doesn't mean you can't be doing things that make you smile. A great source of happiness is progress towards your goals. A common goal of everyone on this sub is to reach FI/RE, problem is humans are inherently shortsighted and progress towards financial independence is to distant to generate happiness on a daily basis. How do you combat this? Set short term actionable goals that you can see and feel the results of. This could be your related to your FI goals (e.g don't go to starbucks this week and put that $20 bucks saved into savings) or it could be for other life goals like fitness or relationships, whatever you want as long as it helps you get through those unpleasant days with a smile on your face.


2.) **The often spouted phrase: ""Surround yourself with like minded people"" in order to be successful is bullshit. It is more important to surround yourself with friends and family.**

It depends on your definition of success though. If you think success means having a lot of money then sure go ahead and prioritize your professional relationship, but if you think there is more to success than that then don't neglect your social support network. 

My dad burnt a lot of bridges with friends and family in the pursuit of financial success, and it didn't come back to bite him until much later. The truth is the types of connections you make and nurture to aid your financial success are not the ones that stick around. What's the point in having financial freedom if you have no one to enjoy it with?

___

My main takeaway is that it is easy to focus to on the end goal (FI/RE) and forget about the journey. In the end your happiness is paramount.

1119,It's the work it took to get to FI that made me truly happy,,675,enpovr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/enpovr/its_the_work_it_took_to_get_to_fi_that_made_me/,1578847312.0,"I only started thinking about financial independence (FI) when I turned 30. From that point forward I was obsessed with that very thought of being financially free and not having to work for a living. I remember driving to work on weekdays and seeing some people playing a round of golf in my neighbourhood while I was focused on making it into work on time. Now I  do understand that not all those people were financially independent, but just the thought that some might have been was enough to get me thinking what it would be like having that freedom and I started working towards it.

Fast forward about 15 years …and I'm now at the point where I've reached financial independence (44yrs) through real estate investing and to be honest with you, early retirement scares me. I could be one of those people playing golf while watching those people driving their cars going to work and hoping they will make it on time. (full circle, it seems). This is a very short post, and I haven't gone into much detail about it but I've concluded that being financially free is great but it is not everything, I find that it's setting goals and working towards achieving them that makes me happy. Looking back I think that it's the work it took to get to FI that made me truly happy. Being productive and doing what you like, and I also understand that for some people, going to their work as an employee truly makes them happy because they are passionate about what they do. I've heard that this applies to about 1/5 of the workforce and I certainly wasn't part of that group.

I don’t know why but now that I've reached this FI point, it is not as appealing to me anymore, I don’t have the urge to retire early mainly because I want to set other goals. Perhaps this is retirement if you look at it this way. Doing what you enjoy while not having to work for someone else and having the time and resources to do it.

1121,Change my view : Nursing is a better FI route than being a doctor,,673,8l5grc,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8l5grc/change_my_view_nursing_is_a_better_fi_route_than/,1526946933.0,"This is going to sound biased because I am a nurse and money shouldn’t be the only reason for joining one of these fields. The main reason why I am stating this is because I think a large majority of people think becoming a MD is a good financial route. 

It takes 4 years to receive a Bachelors in Nursing and you can start working full time at the age of 21-22 if you started right after highschool. Nursing school will put the average individual 20-40K in debt. An average RN will make 50-60K a year starting. In my case, I will easily make 100K my first year because of overtime (50 hour weeks) and union pay. Their is a nurse at my hospital who works 80 hour weeks working nights and cleared 300K this past year. Let’s just assume that a nurse averages 65K for 8 years. That’s slightly over 500K at age 30 while an MD has barely started making money yet and is still in crazy debt. Many RNs have access to unlimited overtime so it wouldn’t be too challenging to gross 1M in 8-10 years. 

 It takes 4 years of undergrad and 4 years of med school to just get your MD license. The average med student will graduate 300K in debt. You then start your residency which is on average 4 years unless you are going into a specialty which will be 6-7 years. For those 4-7 years you are making 50K a year working 60-80 hour work weeks. This number is from the residents who I have spoken to at my hospital. After finishing residency, you will become an attending physician. Internal Medicine MDs will make about 220K starting and Specialty MDs will make around 300-400K. MD don’t start making real money till the age of 29-33 if starting right after highschool. 

An MD will also miss 8 years of being in the market meanwhile an RN will be in the market the whole time. Lastly, an RN can become a CRNA (certified registered nurse anesthetist) in 2-3 years of schooling and 2 years of experience. A CRNA can easily clear 200K a year starting. One can easily make the argument that an RN is a better FIRE approach than an MD. In my case, I should easily be able to FIRE by age 45-50 since starting working at the age of 22. 


EDIT: This blew up. My view has been changed. I think my argument lies more in that nursing CAN definitely be a better FI route in some circumstances (mine for example). From someone coming from a family where I would have had to take on 300K in debt to do med school it wouldn’t make sense. States such as CA or NY where nurses start at $40-$50 before OT can be more profitable in the long term. Obviously, ones reasons for joining healthcare should be far more important than money. I enjoy my job and wouldn’t change what I decided to do with my education/career. 


EDIT 2: I also think it depends on someone’s definition of FI is. If 1M-2M is your goal, a RN will achieve that quicker in average if starting directly out of college. If 5-10M is your goal, hands down an MD would win no matter what. 

EDIT 3: I think this title should read that nurses become FI quicker than doctors. That seems to be more accurate",financialindependence

I am a full time teacher.  Effectively I work nine months a year, which is great theoretically, but that means 25% of the time I am not working and not generating income.  I was looking for a side gig that would let me monetize some of this extra time in pursuit of FI.

First Attempt at a Side Gig

I wanted something different from teaching that was internet based so I could do it while traveling in the summer, or on breaks during the day.  I tried writing as a side gig at first.  It was a great change from teaching, but even after more than a year, I had trouble making it pay.

Playing to my Strengths

Since my experience is in teaching and I hold a terminal degree, I switched to looking for online teaching jobs to capitalize on my strengths.  Online classes typically allow students to turn in work electronically which can then be graded whenever the instructor has time, so these classes are very flexible.  This is great for students, but is also great for me as a side gig.

Seven Years Building the Side Gig

I wish I could say it was a quick and easy process, but it wasn't.  It took time and hard work.  The first year (2013) I was able to make about 3000 bucks teaching courses online at a University.  Over the past seven years, I have grown this side gig by searching for more jobs at more schools and by developing new courses.

What happened in 2018?

2018 was a bit of an outlier income wise because in spring I took over for a teacher who was out on maternity leave and taught her full time on-line load.  That was good money, but required three or four hours of work a day for those few months, and I would probably not do that again.

How My Side Gig Growth Powered my Investments

It took about five years, but in 2017 I was able to live off my sidegig, allowing me to invest the proceeds of my full time teaching job.  I have always contributed some amount towards a 403b and a 457b at work.  Since I was now able to live off my side gig, I was able to max out these accounts.

The workload

As I became more efficient as an online instructor, I was able to design courses that were more idiot proof, requiring me to answer fewer panicked emails from students, and requiring less manual grading and work on my part.  I probably answer fifty emails a week from students from six or eight different email accounts.   Currently my side gig takes about three hours a week, almost all of which I do on breaks during my day job.

Looking for Work

I am still teaching at the first University where I started, but the needs of schools fluctuate semester to semester and year to year.  I work at some schools where I get one course a year, and others were I get four a semester.  I worked at two schools for about two years and then did not get courses again at either one, perhaps because they hired a full timer to cover that work, perhaps because of lower enrollment.  Since some of my jobs are stable and others fluctuate or may decay, I spend a 40 hour week every spring during spring break looking for more work, sending out emails and resumes and applying for jobs.  I apply to about a hundred positions in that time.  Some years I gain another school with another course or two.  Some years I don't get any new work.

Taxes

My taxes are a total clusterfuck.  Last year I filed taxes in seven different states.  I always owe money at the end of the year because if I teach one course in a state for 2000 bucks, it looks like I am a pour, and they don't take much out in taxes, but when it comes time to do taxes at the end of a year, I am taxed at a much higher rate because of my overall income.  I have mitigated this problem by playing with my withholdings whenever possible.

Spreadsheet Anxiety

While it may not be a problem for some people, for a spreadsheety FIREy motherfucker like me, it is awful to get paid so often in tiny little amounts.  Between 11/29 and 12/6 I will be paid seven times.  I realize the desire to check everything is irrational, but I will check each and every one of those payments on the day they come in, which has me screwing around with my budget spreadsheet and thinking about small amounts of money much too often than I am comfortable with.  I realize this is a great problem to have, but it bugs me OCDly.

Churning

All these teaching jobs are all w-2 gigs with direct deposits, which means I have many direct deposits to deal with.  Direct Deposits are required for account opening bonuses at banks.  Last year I paid for a trip to Paris with bonuses from banks.

Fuck you money it ain't, but...

One unforeseen advantage to having so many different gigs is that I have almost no worry about losing a job.  I have so many jobs that I could lose several of them, including my full time job, and while it would suck, I would still not have to touch my nest egg.  This isn't quite the same as fuck you money, but this has had a subtle effect on me, making me more confident, more likely to speak up at my full time job.  It has made me less likely to pay as much attention to a student's  threat to go to the dean and get me fired because they got a bad grade.

Transition to RE

When I RE, I plan on keeping this side gig until pension/social security kick in. With luck, I can live on it and not touch my nest egg.  I can travel and work abroad as long as I have an internet connection every day or two.  After Social Security kicks in, I am likely to let this side gig decay naturally by not looking for new work as schools change or drop off my teaching list.  In addition, the online teaching industry is in flux.  I wouldn't surprise me if much of it were automated over the next ten to fifteen years, which is another reason that I can't necessarily count on this income long term.

Conclusion

I see people on this forum suggest that they will become a teacher as a sort of alternative to Barista FIRE to use to coast into retirement, and I have to laugh.  Teaching ain't working in a salt mine, but half of all teachers quit after less than five years, so it isn't for everyone.  To be successful at teaching requires a strange mixture of creativity, compassion and tolerance for administrivia.  That is the precise mixture that helped me in my side gig where I deal with seven different email accounts, seven different calendars and seven different sets of rules and requirements, not to mention designing online courses in many different on-line learning management systems.

One month ago I discovered the FIRE Movement. As part of my 'reducing expenses"" phase, I started bringing my lunch to work and eating out less often. I knew this would save me some money, but I didn't realize that it would also save me calories. My homemade lunches turn out to have less calories than the burritos or Subway sandwiches (foot long always) that I bought at lunch. In one month, I've lost 6 lbs.  I wasn't overweight at all, but could lose about 10-12 lbs.  So, unless I have some disease that coincidentally caused weight loss at the same time (work stress causes me to worry I have deadly diseases), I haven't changed anything else in my exercise or diet. Just making more homemade meals.

For a long-term retirement savings plan, an HSA is worthwhile to take advantage of if allowed by your health insurance plan. Fidelity is now offering a no quarterly fee HSA with no minimum. I think most all other HSA providers charge a quarterly fee or require you to keep a few thousand dollars of the account in a liquid cash account side (that pays 0.1%) before you can invest any additional money of the account into mutuals funds:

https://www.fidelity.com/go/hsa/why-hsa

I will probably open an account with them and stop adding to my employer sponsored HSA plan. Other than the tax free aspect of it allowing you pay medical bills, and possibly health insurance premiums down the road, it is a good vehicle to place investments that are not subject to a required minimum withdrawal after age 70.5 . For those of you who are in your 20's, 30's, etc. , you stand a good chance of living into your 90's statistically, and maybe past. Having investments that can compound for 60 years, with an initial tax deductible boost, is pretty good.",financialindependence

Bored?  Initially but weather has cleared up and he’s all good.

Financial advisor?  Yes, meeting with them today.

Kids?  Adults and out of the house.

Sacrifices made?  None that he could think of.  He’s traveled internationally since I’ve known him and enjoys going out for dinner/drinks.

Real estate?  Yes - several rental properties that he started investing in during the downturn and this has helped.

Long-term living?  Moving from the Midwest to a southern state.

I recently got a job offer, and accepted. My pay will spike significantly from $18k post-tax to $54k post-tax. I already plan on socking away 25% into my 401k (the max I can at this company) and maxing an IRA, but this still leaves me with (very roughly) 30k to do as I please.

1) My savings are already automated, even if it is only a little bit per month.

2) The company hard caps pre-tax contributions at 25% per check, I make up the difference in maxing it post-tax.

3) I don't plan on living ""miserly"", I know I definitely need/want a higher budget. Just trying to determine how to manage it/how much to increase it by. I've seen comments ranging from 10-25%, so I'll work something out.

* 2019: 40 years old, $300k invested.

Ten years ago I was doing just fine. The deepest trough of the recession had passed, but it was still a pretty unsettling time. I was content to be in grad school, insulated from the outside world, with a steady stipend of $28k from a grant, plus an additional few k a year from doing translation work and academic consulting. I was saving the $4k / year max to my Roth most years and that was it.

I was lucky to be in the ivory tower, mainly because I really enjoyed my thinking work, and enjoyed especially the scientific programming aspects of my biology research. I was good at being a graduate student. But I was also lucky because it seemed scary out there, and comfortable in here. Also, I had student loan debt that I could keep deferring while I was technically still a student.

It took me a long time to leave the academic world. I bounced around with postdocs for a while, before finally making an intentional decision with my partner to move to put down roots. That was the single biggest factor in my current happiness, and in helping me move out of academic work.

10 years later, we have an old, lovely, expensive house in a neighborhood we would be happy to stay in forever. I have been working as a data scientist for the last three years. The goal of FI has been central in my decision making, helping me focus on maximizing my income now (within reason) to get free of the working world when I want. Knock on wood, I'll hit my goal before 55, probably 50. I just crossed the $300k mark for my investments, excluding e-fund / house / other assets. I have no debt other than the mortgage.

Lessons learned in the last decade:

* Leaving academia was the best financial and overall well-being decision I made
* Patiently sticking to a FI plan has been rewarding, and I thank this community for the inspiration.

Edit: I appreciate the interest in how I made the transition to data science. I'll make a post over in r/datascience sometime soon to explain more. 

As for others considering making the change from academia: Yes, life is good out here!",financialindependence

I am currently 18 about to turn 19 and this past year I've been taking personal finance a bit more seriously. I am a full time student but I do have a part time job as a tutor and I started saving most of my income (about 90%) to invest a part of it in a year or so (once I know enough about investing), to save up for university, and for retirement.

The problem is that I learnt about finance on my own and come from a middle class family who doesn't have a problem with money but who never really saved up for something big either (they didn't have an IRA before a couple of years ago). My mom is always talking about the fact that I started working but I barely use my money (the first pay I had she went on about  me not using it to buy her something.) I mean, don't get me wrong I do think it's important to spoil your loved ones once in a while but that's too much, right? She's also telling me I should at least use my money for myself like go to the spa get my nails done and take care of myself but I just can't afford it. Also, I feel bad waisting money on something that will not benefit me in the longer run. I know she thinks I'm cheap and I tried to explain to her that I'm just trying to look at the bigger picture but I guess she doesn't really understand me. Now I stopped answering her and I just kinda let her say whatever she wants because I dont want to fight with her.

My dad is more understanding. Whenever i want to buy something (like books for school or when a needed a new desk) he insists on getting it for me but doesn't tell my mom he baught it for me.",financialindependence

**The Idea:** Build a business you can walk away from. 

**The Context:** My wife and I run a small marketing business that makes $200k per year. Our profit margin is \~70%, and we pay ourselves $50k/yr each. I also have a FT role ($75k) with a startup. We spend $50k, but our FIRE goal is to be able to sustain $75k per year. With 2 little kids, our goal isn't necessarily to build up as much as possible and then retire completely. It's to optimize our time so we get as much time with them as possible. 

**The Breakdown:**

With our current numbers, it would take \~9 years to invest enough to sustain $75k/yr. OR we could take the next 2 years to get our business to the point where it can support 75% of the salary at 25% of the effort (\~15 hrs per week). 

It would take *a lot* to get there: systems, training, higher pay, and hiring a full time employee to act as an account manager. But I believe we could get there in 18-24 months. And, since I have my startup salary, we could still continue to build our stash. 

**The Upshot:** It would mean a much lower profit margin, but also a much lower time investment after the next couple of years.

* What are the cons to this approach I may not be considering?

  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8sr8tx/my_desire_to_fire_has_opened_up_some_very/?st=JIPVRLET&sh=5d95f716

A few people asked me to elaborate on my “Work Smart” philosophy instead of the usual putting your head down and grinding mentality that is the norm to advancing.

Before I begin, I have only used this in a corporate setting and cannot guarantee this will work in other work environments, however most of this will sound simple once you read it.


Let’s start with Internships 

So you land an internship for the summer and you have 8 weeks to leave your Mark with your employer.

Work Smart
1) Use your time to do as much research as possible to understand how the business works and what are some common challenges.

2) ask a lot of questions from long time employees about their day to day and learn from them.

3) work hard to make people’s lives easier by figuring out a simple solution to a simple problem that annoys everyone.  Trust me we all have small issues that we can never get to since we’re occupied with other things.

4). When given only basic tasks to work on, make sure to do then the best way anyone can and take it upon your self to get involved in more complex tasks.  Approach this from a “I am really interested in helping solve this issue”.

5) Schedule meetings with influencers to get to know them and ask them questions about how they became successful.   2 things ring true wherever I’ve been
       1) people like receiving sincere compliments.
       2) people love to talk about themselves.


6)   Make sure to be helpful at least once to the people that have the ability to hire you.

7) Ask your boss to advocate for you and get you a full time offer or part time work during school.    So many people just never bother to ask or make it known that they are hungry and want to continue working.


Don’t do this

1) treat an internship like summer camp.
2) Expect to be told exactly what to do.
3) only hang out with other interns or people your age.
4) leave exactly at 5 if you’re working on an interesting project.


So many interns at my company don’t realize that they are in a competition to maybe fill in 1 spot.  As managers we are looking for the brightest and the best and if you don’t stick out to us then you won’t get a shot.


Entry level job


So you’re hired full time and now you must do the work. 

Work Smart

1) you just landed an MBA class of the real world where they pay you to learn.  So make sure you learn something new each day or your Day was a failure.

2)  There are no problems only solutions.  When you approach your manager with a problem or issue always start with a solution and let your manager decide if you should implement it.

3) Be confident even if you’re wrong.   No body’s perfect and your manager probably has a lot on their plate.  Having an employee that comes to me with a solution and takes some chances on their own in order to make my life easier is a breath of fresh air.  Granted there are big decisions that need multiple perspectives and sign offs but do the work yourself and come to your manager confidently with a solution.

4) manage up.  Your sole job is to make your manager look good and earn more money with the hope that they cut you a slice.   Make sure to help your manager look good. 

5) Don’t take credit for things.   We hate credit hogs and can see right through them.   We know who does what and even if we miss a few things it won’t matter.   Just keep on solving things the reward will come because no one will replicate what you do.

6) make sure your peers are involved in your ideas and win them over to your side.  This is not a to the death competition.  You are all a team so get the rest of the team on board to your ideas and then present them with the team to management.   This shows that not only can you come up with solutions but you can also build a consensus.

7) Do the next level up job and don’t take the credit.  I believe that we should all be working the next job we want.  When it’s time for promotions we know who has the skills to move to the next level.

8) Develop relationships with key people that will mentor you and help you advance in your career.

9)  Understand the big picture and be a team player.  

10)  if you’re ultimate goal is to be a leader then start leading now.  A title does not make a leader successful rather people need to gravitate to you.   Leading without a title and having people want to follow you is the recipe for a true strong leader.

1142,The three things standing between most people and FI,,657,74vbi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/74vbi3/the_three_things_standing_between_most_people_and/,1507388388.0,"I have been thinking about an [article I read over on Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/financial-advice/2014/06/24/save_money.aspx) and it's relevance to those of us seeking FI.  We hear all the time about ""prevent life-style inflation"" and we often treat that as ""don't go out to eat so much,"" ""make sure you don't splurge too much on entertainment,"" etc...  However the vast majority of lifestyle inflation as that article points out is in 3 things:

 * Your Education
 * Your House
 * Your Car(s)

** Education**

For those of us already graduated with school far in the past there is not much we can do about the education part, but for those just starting out on this journey know this:  **The vast majority of employers don't give a rip about what school your degree is from!**  I went to community college for my first 2 years of schooling because it was 1/2 the cost for the same gen-ed courses I would need at the 4 year school, and the credits would transfer.  This has saved me countless thousands of dollars in debt.

** Your House **

Houses in America have been getting larger and larger since the 70s.

> Over the last 42 years, the average new US house has increased in size by more than 1,000 square feet, from an average size of 1,660 square feet in 1973 (earliest year available from the Census Bureau) to 2,687 square feet last year. Likewise, the median-size house has increased in size by almost 1,000 square feet, from 1,525 square feet in 1973 to 2,467 last year. In percentage terms, both the average and median size of new US houses have increased by 62% since 1973. [source](http://www.aei.org/publication/new-us-homes-today-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-living-space-per-person-has-nearly-doubled/)

The reality is you should buy the least amount of house you can that fits your needs.  And you should really evaluate what those needs are!  **YES** two children can share a room growing up and still survive to adulthood.  **NO** you shouldn't buy a home assuming you'll have 4 children when you are still a childless couple just starting out.  If you aren't sure what your needs are going to be in the future then rent!   This is one aspect of my life where I really did mess up (own more bedrooms than people in my family), but if I had just rented a few more years we would have realized ""Hey, we aren't going to have 5 kids after all, maybe we don't need a 6 bed-room house.""

** Your Car **

Ah the automobile!  Is there anything more quintessentially ""American"" than driving around in a large depreciating chunk of your net worth.  A car is not an investment, a car is a liability.  It's cost will (with rare exception) go down in value over time.  So you know how much money you should put in that?  **The minimum you can!**  A single $30K car purchase can set back your FI/RE plans by over 2 years!   Buying used vehicles and driving them till they die really is the most affordable way to own an automobile.  For a good punch in the face look at this check out [the relevant MMM article](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/28/new-cars-and-auto-financing-stupid-or-sensible/) on why not to buy a new car (pay particular attention to what he calls **automotive inventory**).

These 3 aspects of your life are the single largest predictor of your success at achieving FI/RE.  Minimize your expenses in these areas going forward, and someday you can own the McMansion, and drive the new car.  Ignore your spending in this area at your own peril.",financialindependence

It’s been almost exactly two years for me, so I figured I’d share my story.

###The Beginning
I started my FIRE strategy right after finishing college in 1996 with a couple of degrees in Computer Science. Initially, I lived fairly cheaply, living with roommates, but without a car, in a fairly pricy city. I’d estimate that in any given month, I saved somewhere in the area of 35-50% of my net salary.

I didn’t particularly deny myself one-off things I wanted to do. I’d guess I ate out at least a couple times a week with friends, but I only spent money on things I actually cared about. For instance, it took over a year for me to get a bed, and then only because my mother said I’d never get a girlfriend without a bed. She was probably right.

###My FIRE Strategy
My main strategy wasn’t so much to avoid one-time expenses, but rather to avoid ongoing monthly expenses like cable, internet, high rent, car expenses, and Starbucks. Though I didn’t know the term “hedonic adaptation” at the time, I had a natural intuition about it so avoided costly pleasures that I didn’t think would lead to sustainable happiness.

My strategy differed from the typical FIRE strategy in two ways. First, I managed my own investments, largely focussing on the stock market. Overall, this wasn’t a particularly effective strategy for me—I roughly equalled the return of the indices. Most of my failures were as a result of investing in businesses that looked to be cheap, but turned out to be value traps. I would’ve saved a lot of time if I just did index investing, but to me, it was something I enjoyed, so it wasn’t terrible.

Second, in my career, I constantly aimed for low-cost, positive black swans. By a “black swan”, I mean a low-probability event that has a disproportionately large upside—like lottery tickets that had a small but realistic chance of winning. But I didn’t want to pay a lot for those black swans, since they were low probability. Ideally they would be free.

An example of this was in my first job. After my 6-month performance review, my boss wanted to give me a large bump-up in salary. Instead, I asked for a bunch of stock options in the company. My reasoning was that any salary increase would be taxed at high marginal rates. Plus, a higher salary was likely to lead to lifestyle inflation and the associated hedonic adaptation. In combination, these factors meant that a salary increase likely wouldn’t boost my savings rate or happiness that much, so what was the point?

In contrast, options could lead to a huge windfall at some time in the future, which would be taxed at the advantageous options tax rate, and wouldn’t result in lifestyle inflation until it actually happened.  I think the main argument against this options strategy is that salary increases compound (a 5% raise when you’re making $100K is much greater than a 5% raise when you’re making $30K). As it happens, that concern didn’t prove to be much of a problem to me—my boss ended up giving me the options and a decent salary increase.

###Results
I got pretty lucky, cashing out those software company stock options in late 1999. Other black-swanlike things I did included starting businesses, often funded by other people’s money or on a shoestring budget so the opportunity cost (i.e. the cost I’m paying to expose myself to the positive black swan) wouldn’t be so great.  I’d guess that about 25% of these sorts of things worked out.  That seems like a low percentage, but each black swan is a huge win so 25% is a perfectly acceptable number.

I also got burned by a black swan as well. I could’ve bought a house early on, but I didn’t because real estate was already somewhat pricey, and it seemed like I could get more value from investing that cash. The problem is that I live in Vancouver, and a huge real estate bubble developed over that time. Now, a 1400 square foot run-down house in this city can cost $2-3M.  Any purchase now would make a serious dent in our FI nest egg. So, we continue to rent.

I’m still not sure this was a bad decision as opposed to a bad outcome.  When real estate is expensive, it doesn’t seem logical to buy on the belief that it will get to bubble levels of expensive. Sure, occasionally it will, but it doesn’t seem like a smart bet to make.

My final result is that, using a 2.5% safe withdrawal rate, my family reached FIRE two years ago when I was 42.

###My FI Life
My life now is fairly different than it was. I get up at about the same time I used to so that I can have breakfast with my family, though maybe once I month, I’m tired, so I go back to bed for a couple of hours. I do more of the housework, cook dinner more often, and follow the markets. I also do things I couldn’t do before, like picking up my kids from school and watching my son play ultimate after school.

One of the biggest advantages has been the flexibility. Historically, when a kid got sick or my wife ran late in picking them up, it resulted in her scrambling to pick up the pieces. She managed, but it was far from ideal. Now, it’s much easier to deal with these issues when they occur.

I’m not really a workaholic, but I also am not the type to simply focus on hedonistic pursuits indefinitely. Or perhaps a better way of stating it is, for me, being at least somewhat productive brings me pleasure.

So, I’ve started writing, both a blog and novels. In October, I published my first book, a young-adult science fiction novel. Of course, this is another black swan strategy, though not a cheap one—the opportunity cost is super high.

I consider my writing my current job, albeit one that I can slack off at as much as I like. I’ve rigorously maintained timesheets of my work on it, and I’ve averaged maybe a bit over five hours a day writing. I suspect that this isn’t all that different from how much I worked at my old job, if you exclude time spent talking with people in the kitchen and generally messing around. But my commute is greatly improved.

The things I don’t miss at all about my last job were the politics, the short-sighted, incredibly slow decision-making, and the unproductive work. I do miss the people—I still see some of them occasionally, but it’s not on a daily basis as it was before. That difference is significant and a big downside to FIRE, or at least FIRE as I am choosing to live it now.

Nevertheless, the main appeal of FIRE to me is the security and the flexibility, and I am enjoying those aspects as much as I anticipated. Now if I could just buy a darn house….

&#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow!

1146,One accountant’s journey to FIRE: 200k mark a,,656,8thtsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8thtsy/one_accountants_journey_to_fire_200k_mark_a/,1529847327.0,"**About me**

Hi! I’m a 26F CPA living in Toronto, Canada. I wanted to post this to show the non IT people in this sub that don’t make 100k+ right out of school that it’s possible to increase net worth quickly even without those things. I’ve always been a saver but I discovered MMM in December 2015 (when I was 24). The realization I could retire at 35 really lit a fire under my ass to save even more and actually invest it. I was working through my CPA at a big 4 accounting firm at the time and hated every second of it. To be honest, accounting is boring and a ‘meh’ career at best, but the money is good so I will most likely stay on this path until I feel FI enough, if not actual FIRE.

I live in the downtown core of the most if not second most expensive city in Canada, sharing a two bedroom condo apartment with my SO. I have no expensive hobbies other than travel and lead a pretty ‘boring’ life. I’m slowly getting healthier and into exercising but those things are harder for me than saving money.

The privilege – My parents paid for 3 out of my 4 years of university. That’s about 36k that I got for free which will never have to be repaid (I asked). That one year and for the 2 years I lived on campus I paid for myself through part time jobs before and during university. I also went back to live with my parents for one year rent free during my 5 years of working, which was a nice boost to my net worth during that time.

Here are the numbers!

**The goals**

My spending goal in retirement for one person is $20,000-$30,000 per year (as part of a $40,000-$60,000 spend household). I expect my SO to pay their own way on this FIRE journey. The dream at the moment looks like one year on one year off long term slow travel, most likely for 5ish years of travel. On the off years, we could work, volunteer, whatever. These FIRE plans are not that defined because who knows what I’ll feel like in 5-10 years.

All else being equal (is it ever?) I expect to achieve the following net worth milestone at the following ages:

|Annual Spend (individual)|$20,000.00||$25,000.00||$30,000.00||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FI @ 4&#37;|$500,000.00|29|$625,000.00|30|$750,000.00|33|
|FI @ 3.5&#37;|$571,428.57|30|$714,285.71|31|$857,142.86|34|
|FI @ 3.25&#37;|$615,384.62|30|$769,230.77|32|$923,076.92|35|
|FI @ 3&#37;|$666,666.67|31|$833,333.33|32|$1,000,000.00|35|

\^the above does not account for market corrections/recessions. If one happens tomorrow obviously those ages will change.

My flair is based on the first goal - $500k for 20k of spending at 4&#37;. Is that going to be the number I FIRE at? Probably not, given the expectation of a low growth environment in the near future and my young age at the expected time. But it’s a number that I would feel comfortable about enough to shift into something more chill. It’s possible and even likely that I’ll experience the golden handcuffs phenom and stay for a while past that though to feather the nest and add security.

Future plan/goals – I have no interest in having children, which enables my fast FIRE journey and long term travel plans. I am also lukewarm towards real estate because of the very high property prices in Toronto as compared to rents, and my distaste at paying maintenance fees on condos .AKA if I buy; it has to be a freehold house, which makes homeownership an even more expensive proposition. While Canada is great, it’s also possible that I will be OK with living somewhere else with single payer health care long term (I hate winter), so that’s another reason buying is not high on the priority list.

**Income history and Net Worth**

I started my career at a big 4 accounting firm making 45k, then 50k the next year, then 60k the next. These are standard salaries for this job in my city – Toronto. During this time I was renting a place downtown with a roommate or SO.

After leaving the firm my first job out was at 75k, and I moved to live with my parents for that year. Getting rid of rent was amazing for my net worth.  Then I moved to a more interesting job that I thought I would love for 80k and started paying rent again. Now I’m still paying rent, but making 95k somewhere else.

I do have access to a side hustle that I started participating in around 2016. It’s very CPA specific and involves helping incoming CPAs get feedback for their practice exams in preparation for the qualification exams we have to write in this profession. I think I made <$2000 the first year I did it, but it grew steadily and I made $13,000 last year from this.

My net worth started at -$10,000 on the day I graduated university in the summer of 2013. That debt was owed to my parents for a lavish long trip I took that summer which I repaid in my first year of working. No regrets. After I started working and saving, it began steadily going up. My records are spotty in the beginning, since I was just saving to save.

I reached the 100k milestone sometime in November 2016 at 24 years old, 3 years and 2 months after my first day of work.

|Mar/2018|$196,280.12|
|Apr/2018|$204,157.49|

I reached the 200k milestone sometime in April 2018 at 26 years old, 1 year and 5 months after 100k (4 years, 7 months after my first day of work). It definitely gets faster (especially if you have year of not paying rent!).

All else equal and barring a downturn, I hope to achieve the 300k milestone around winter 2019. Depending on the side hustle this year and with my increased income, here’s hoping for Dec 2018 instead of March 2019.

**Monthly expenses**

For a millennial living in a huge high COL city, I don’t spend a lot of money. This has enabled me to save a ton of money even on my medium salaries.

Currently, this is how much I spend

Rent: $1,100 (my half of a $2,200 apartment)

Electricity: $25 (my half, goes up and down slightly with the weather)

Internet: $25 (my half)

Phone: has been free for the last year because of my job. I suspect with the new job I’ll need to pay around $40.

Transportation: $0-$120 depending on the weather. I walk to work in the summer and take transit in the winter (-25C is not good walking weather).

Groceries and household: $120-$200 depending on my laziness really.

Eating out and entertainment: $100-$150 depending on my laziness, inversely correlated with groceries. There will be a social event once a month or so with friends.

Monthly total: $1,370-$1,660. That works out to $16,440 to $19,920 annually without accounting for extras like vacation. This year that will add about $3,000 to the budget.

**Investments**

My tax advantaged accounts are maxed out and self-managed through a DIY brokerage. My taxable contributions are split evenly between the same self-managed DIY brokerage and a robo advisor for shits and giggles. The robo advisor is winning at the moment, because I view my DIY brokerage holdings as a whole unit so my taxable account gets the brunt of the bonds (low rate environment).

The DIY Portfolio is as follows:

Cash: 0&#37;

Bonds: 13&#37; (preference is 10&#37;), ZAG mostly. I’m meh about this allocation.

REITs: 4&#37; (preference is 5&#37;), VRE mostly. Also meh about this allocation.

Canadian dividend stocks: 7&#37; (preference is 2&#37;, my investing strategy used to be dividend based so this is a remaining position from then), CDZ.

Canadian Market: 3&#37; (preference is 2&#37;),VCN

US Market – hedged to CAD: 22&#37; (preference is 24&#37;),VUS/VSP

US Market – unhedged: 22&#37; (preference is 24&#37;), VUN/VTI(n USD)

International (both developed and developing) – unhedged: 30&#37; (preference is 33&#37;) XEF+XEC/VXUS(in USD)

My robo advisor has split my investments as follows:

Bonds: $20&#37;

Low carbon global stocks: 27&#37;

Canadian stocks: 23&#37;

Global stocks: 15&#37;

Cleantech stocks: 15&#37;

I’d love any advice on my allocations. I rebalance when I invest so it’s a bit slow.

Is there anything else you want to know?

If this post is well received and the community feels it’s useful, I’ll make another one when I get to $300k.

Edit: my title was too long :( it's supposed to say 'at 26' at the end. Live and learn i guess.",financialindependence

Always a pleasure reading the many success stories, overcame struggles, and humble journeys many of you have shared in this space. I’ll try to keep my story short and hope I can pick the brains of the much more experienced of you all to find a path towards some peace. 

A few days back while scrolling through reddit I run into an imagine/story of your typical firer/rational low key frills family: went to work, spend below their means, and saved. Their net-worth got pretty nice and then Cancer hit one of the partners. Everything they built in years evaporated in months. Obviously this was in the US where despite having insurance, medical costs can still bankrupt you. I’ve experienced Something similar through the eyes of a close friend. 

I grew up low income, with an overcrowded house hosting multiple families and earning minimum wage. Through great family support, relationships outside of my own and a bit of luck I managed to finish school and found myself in a corporate white collar job. Since growing up living paycheck to paycheck and making the best of resources, one of the core principles of fire (keeping expenses low) wasn’t really that new to me. I already knew how to live next to nothing (by force), I just didn’t know what to do with all the savings. 

Anyway, I am thankful and have found myself, and despite Covid, still with a job and saving quite a bit of money. Through your readings and advice, there is no doubt that I will fire. However, I absolutely still have no safety net. Medical costs still give me nightmares and despite living a rather healthy life, I know illness does not discriminate. 

My question, for all you firers that have your budgets, your savings goals, etc and are now in great position, what are you doing to protect your assets in the rare case that unfortunate event happens?  How do you survive (financially) after creditors from the likes of healthcare (or some other creditor outside of regular banking) come after your assets?

*edit:  hi y’all!  Thank you, thank you very much. I received more than enough humble and honest thoughts and experiences to continue this journey towards freedom. I am sorry if I did not respond to each one of you directly, I’m still going through them and getting your insights.

I googled and found the original Bengen piece, the Trinity Study (why does the /r/FI FAQ say this is the source of the 4% rule, by the way?), and several more. Then I found this: [https://www.kitces.com/march-2012-issue-of-the-kitces-report-expanding-the-framework-of-safe-withdrawal-rates/](https://www.kitces.com/march-2012-issue-of-the-kitces-report-expanding-the-framework-of-safe-withdrawal-rates/)

1154,I would like to share a lesson about pursuing FI learned the hard way,,648,cux2lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cux2lp/i_would_like_to_share_a_lesson_about_pursuing_fi/,1566671047.0,"Hi there. I have been reading this forum for 4-5 years. As many people do, I devoured all the content I could read -- MMM, MadFientist, Daily threads, etc. and got on board with everything. Dramatically lowered my costs, boosted up savings in tax advantaged accounts... even made a career pivot in order to dramatically increase my income. All of that went really well for a good chunk of time.

In Winter 2018, I started to read and learn about cannabis stocks. Learning of the dramatic returns that many companies had produced due to generous estimates of forward multiples, I became seduced by the prospect of accelerating my path to FI. Over the coming months, I started to weight my portfolio heavily and more heavily in favor of cannabis stocks, going overweight in one in particular (Sunniva Inc) that, based on incredibly extensive DD conducted by me, I thought presented really promising prospects for dramatic returns. My rationale to myself was that if this thing goes south, I'm still relatively young (31 years old) and have plenty of years ahead of me to earn lots of money and save it.

As it would turn out, this did not go well. That company has disappointed shareholders time and time again, and in the process I ended up losing 75% of my total portfolio. I sold my shares in the company a week or so ago and was completely devastated. I had such high hopes and expectations for this company delivering dramatic returns and transforming my entire financial situation. It did indeed transform my financial situation -- just not in the direction that I had hoped for.

The lessons learned here are pretty obvious, and they go back to FI principles -- diversification matters, difficult to beat the market, etc. I've lost a substantial portion of my net worth in this move. This isn't a post about shitting on that particular company -- for all I know, given enough time, they will go gangbusters and produce incredible returns for shareholders. That said, I've learned that I simply am not comfortable with that sort of investing. I'd rather trust the basics and control my financial situation by increasing income, decreasing costs, and investing wisely in a simple, diversified portfolio risk adjusted for my age and net worth. 

It is really easy to read MMM, this forum, etc. For me, clearly it was harder to internalize the wisdom of that advice and apply it year in and year out. I hope that I have learned my lesson and will get back on the sound path to financial freedom.",financialindependence

https://imgur.com/mQ488JS

30 yo married no kids. I'm incredibly lucky to be working in the lucrative field of software engineering. My income started at ~$80k 7 years ago, and this year I'm projecting ~$330k.

My wife has dabbled in different fields, spent some time in school, and now she's starting her career in healthcare with income of ~$90k.

I'm also lucky that I got into this FI game early in my life. I started budgeting ~$60k a year for a minimum but comfortable lifestyle in the first year, and tried not to inflate it by much. But oh well, it did - this year's budget is a little more than twice that ($130k). We don’t buy really unnecessary stuff, just treat ourselves to a few nice things in life from time to time (including a house and a nice car).

On investment:
We max out every tax-advantaged account: 401k (54k - wife doesn’t have one at current job), Roth IRAs (11k), and HSA (6.5k). All of that is invested in a basket of cheap index funds. 

With the rest of the money I like to do active investing. My investment style has changed quite a bit over the years, and nowadays I’m a big believer in growth investing. I haven’t tracked returns closely but I’m pretty confident that it’s doing better than the index. I also play with options in small amounts, and it has worked well so far.

Mistakes: 
1. Wasted a bunch of money churning cars and houses. We simply didn’t know what we wanted when we were young and went through a lot of trials and errors. Looking back, it’s not exactly clear that I’d make different choices given the circumstances, but knowing better would have helped. 
2. Did not stick with early investments. I sold a bunch of TSLA at $50, MSFT at $24, FB at $65, and so on. I simply didn’t understand why I bought them in the first place and how much they were really worth. Nowadays I wouldn’t sell even if I think things are massively overvalued, as long as the growth story still holds.

Goal: 
I think I’ll start trying new life arrangements at $3M. It’s hard to predict when since future income isn’t always predictable, but it’s probably in our 40s. It will probably be too early to fully retire by then, and I’m considering alternatives such as part time, sabbatical, starting a business, etc.

Want to go for a movie? Got to pay for it. Want to go on a vacation? Got to pay for it. Want to buy a have a family, children, a house? Got to pay a shitload for it. My father stems from a rather poor background and has worked his way up into top management positions where he earns a good amount of money. When I was young, I was told about the 3 pillars of resource: time, energy and money and that typically the distribution between the three of these is like [this]( https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56daf4c8d51cd4224e4154cb/1512223112189-3SEJUE00E67E1G0IGVLF/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOzBS1jDzJRmQA5ayDq8yKVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpy_OAb7JUX4sJCa2e92dI3SvXmXhM-ok4srFAMCgGvPeX1Dni_gz0JFjTcE6aKcZ_0/url.jpg.jpg?format=500w) and the challenge is to crack this seamlessly endless cycle by having enough of the “enabler-resource” money early on in life. I’ve had this mindset, this goal, as long as I can remember. I traded stuff in school, flipped Yu-Gi-Oh cards, got in to drop shipping, etc. Always with the idea of earning more money in the back of my head. It seems every life decision I’ve made is focused on this topic, of course up to my career path (currently M22 studying engineering and management in Germany). Now with everything I’ve done I made a decent amount of money pre-Covid and was lucky enough to know a few people in order to capitalize on the Covid-situation by supplying PPE from china. Covid didn’t only help me make money but also gave me some time to sit back and think for a minute. It occurred to me that I never knew what I would do if I would actually break the resource-pillar-cycle and had some money at a young age. It’s not like I’m rich and I'm obviously still far away from financial independence but I’m comfortably sitting on about 250k€ cash. 

So, I guess my actual question is: what does it mean to live? What do people do with their time and energy? Along this process I’ve never really had any fun in what I was doing. I always thought the fun part would follow later on. To be honest I don’t even know what I like or what my interests are. It’s amazing to me when I talk to people that are genuinely passionate about something, no matter what that is. I don’t have that kind of passion or eagerness for anything really. I literally hate spending time with myself. When I’m not working on anything I don’t know what to do with myself and just watch stupid YouTube videos or something else to try and pass the time.  

I guess this is more of a stupid rant than anything else but maybe someone can help me out somehow.

Thanks so much.",financialindependence

1162,What US Social Security Is Worth,,647,7x6qhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7x6qhz/what_us_social_security_is_worth/,1518494381.0,"I was interested in the formulas and math behind social security today. It is kind of interesting, and totally subject to change, but understanding the system at a basic level can help you on your path to FIRE.

**TL;DR**: There is a pretty significant advantage in hitting your qualification for SS benefits (40 credits). The next threshold to hit is the $895 AIME first bend cut off. The added value of working past that decreases substantially.

A few things first

*  There are positive and negative scalars that adjust your monthly payout between ages 62 and 70, with the base being 67. All numbers below assume age 67 benefits.
* You need 40 credits to qualify for SS income. You can earn up to 4 credits per year worked, and each credit requires some amount of income. You need to make a little over $5000 per year to earn all four credits in a year in 2018. 

The motivation behind this study is to determine how valuable SS payments are. For example, if your SS gives you $1000 per month, we can use the 4% rule and determine that the SS payment is worth about $300,000.

How is Social Security Calculated?

* If you have less than 40 credits, you get nothing.
* If you have more than 40 credits, your AIME is calculated by taking your average monthly earnings from your 35 highest earning years, adding zeros if necessary.
* You run your AIME through a formula similar to a tax table: Take 90% of the first $895, then 32% of the next $4500 or so, and then 15% for everything after that. There is a cap somewhere I think. The sum of these numbers is your PIA, which is basically your payment per month if you begin withdrawals at age 67.
* If you begin withdrawals at age 62 you get only 70% (for the rest of your life), if you wait until 70 you get 124% (for the rest of your life)

Great so that is how it works. Now lets see what each additional year of work really means for me (our example).

This is my social security earnings table pulled from the social security website, rounded, and context added.

Year| Taxable Income | Credits | Job
---|---|---- | -----
2012| $5000| 4 | Cashier
2013| $0| 0 | College
2014| $15000| 4 | Internship
2015| $31000| 4 | Programmer
2016| $72000| 4 | Programmer
2017| $83000| 4 | Programmer

So right now I am sitting at 20 credits, I am not eligible for social security. If I was eligible today, my AIME would be $489 per month, and the payout would be 90% of that, yielding $440 per month. This is worth about $132,000 using the 4% rule. Assuming of course I waited until age 67.

This chart shows the value at different age brackets: https://i.imgur.com/L4VUKea.png

Ok, so that is pretty substantial. With two years of working in a post college job, and some work done before I've ""saved"" $132,000 more *retirement dollars* than I actually thought. Wait, not really. I am not qualified for that money, so it technically doesn't exist unless I work until I hit 40 credits.

So if I work until I get 40 credits, it will take me (20/4) = 5 more years, or until I hit $5000 earned income in 2022 (adjusting for inflation as needed).

What will my retirement benefits be worth then when I qualify for them, assuming I make the same wage as 2017? 

Year|Extra Years|Monthly Payout|Value @ Age 67|Qualified|Value Add|
--:|--:|--:|--:|:-:|--:|
2018|0|$440.00|$132,000.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2019|1|$617.00|$185,100.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2020|2|$794.00|$238,200.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2021|3|$864.00|$259,200.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2022|4|$927.00|$278,100.00|FALSE|$59,400.00|
2023|5|$990.00|$297,000.00|TRUE|$18,900.00​|


When I finally qualify in the middle of 2022, i'll be eligible for $930 in monthly payments, or $280,000 in SS equivalent wealth. The key significant part of this though is that, my value added to my SS benefits allocation is actually $59,400 per year!

**How is this possible?** 

Because the final value at 40 credits is nearly $300,000 and I won't be eligible at all unless I hit 40 credits. So each year between now and 40 credits are worth an even share of the value. Theoretically in my last year, working that year will be worth all $300,000. The math is simple: if I work that year I'll have $300,000 worth of retirement income, if I don't I'll have nothing.

**Takeaway Number 1: Be sure you qualify for SS if possible. The savings are significant**

If you retire before you hit 40 credits, adding small part time work to get the credits needed, could be worth significantly more than your check from the actual job.

So what about after that? How much is each year worth once you've already qualified?

The system drops off quickly once you meet two thresholds, the $895 AIME cutoff (I hit this in my first 10 years), and the qualification cutoff.

You retain 90% of your earned income average up to that $895 value. After that you retain only 32% of each dollar up to about $5400 per month, and 15% over that.

For me personally, my value added drops to about $19,000 per year until I hit the upper threshold in around 2043, then it drops to about $9000 per year.

So you might be thinking, $19,000 that is pretty good per year. I might work longer. But remember this isn't the same as savings in today's money. This is the ""after growth"" value. It is what you would theoretically have at age 67, removing all inflation. Lets see how much money we would need to invest in the S&P500 to get that same $19,000 for working one year.

I'll be age 32 when I jump down to the $19,000 per year threshold. At that time I'll be 35 years away from retirement.

My theoretical return on an investment, after inflation, would be (1.07)^35 = 10.68. 

So if we divide $19,000 by 10.68 we get our true equivalent savings rate: $1779 per year. Probably not enough to keep me in the work force.

Applying this method to the SS value added in the first phase (qualifying) and we can see effective additional savings of $5,000 or more.

**Takeaway Number 2: Social Security Benefits ramp down quickly after you qualify**

That pretty much sums up what I know. Please share corrections, and other knowledge I've missed.

I’m curious as to everyone’s feedback on this idea because it seems to combine the two things typically advised against the most: taking money from your 401k and paying off your mortgage. 

The author proposes using the latest 401k tax adjustments from the CARES Act that waives the 10% early withdrawal fee, but also claims it would be savvy even with the fee.

Do these rules continue to hold strong and this is a doubly bad idea or would unprecedented current events make you reconsider?

I thought this was relevant to FI because housing costs are typically the primary concern for many. If paying off a mortgage earlier rather than later allows you to focus on additional savings and financial independence, is it worth it? Especially if you plan to stay in the same house for the next 10+ years and have another 20 or more left in your career. Personally if our mortgage were $500 a month, we would have a lot of freedom to decide what comes next and not necessarily take the highest paying job. 

[Read the article here. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/08/given-current-rates-cashing-out-your-401k-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-can-make-you-a-bundle/#6ef7ed24b09b)

Under the act, loan limits have doubled from $50k or 50% of vested balance (whichever is lower) to $100,000 or 100% of your account balance (whichever is lower) total without the 10% early-withdrawal penalty. 

I am by no means an expert on how the CARES Act work, but there appears to be two kinds of applicable benefits in terms of your 401k:

1) Withdrawal - under the act, you don’t pay the 10% penalty normal to individuals under 59 1/2. Additionally if you replace the money within 3 years, you are able to recover the federal and state income taxes that apply to the withdrawal according to the American Retirement Association.

2) Loan - To qualify, the loan must be made within 180 days after the act was passed. The participant won’t owe income tax on the amount borrowed from the 401k if it’s paid back within 5 years according to the American Retirement Association.",financialindependence

* 2011: $52,000     
* 2012: $54,000

* 2013: $2,550     
* 2014: $3,890     
* 2015: $2,570     
* 2016: $2,310     
* 2017: $2,600     

With a high end estimate included for 2017 this averages to $2,760 a month.  The outlier in 2014 is $1,450 added from the car purchase, stripping that out you can see a good base level of consistency.

**Phony Alert**: I graduated without student loan debt thanks to my school choice, some hard work, but also 8k/year tuition support from my parents.  While unemployed (2009) I moved back home to live bill free, and I stayed there while underemployed (2010) and employed (2011).  This let me continue looking for work in my major, take a foot-in-the-door internship, and save up a down payment for my own house.  I also used a family car that limped along into 2014 and they insured.

**Background**: Graduating out into the Great Recession was a lesson in feeling helpless I was dedicated not to repeat.  For the early years my target was “fuck this” money that would let me lose or walk away from my job with a carefree shrug.  When I found myself holding an unwieldy 3+ years worth of expenses in a bank account and taxable brokerage I started after “fuck you” money and have been chasing it ever since.

**W2 Job**: At this point I’m not pursuing additional growth in salary.  The high income in the last three years is due to some likely unsustainable bonuses, I expect things to at best level off in the short term.  It’s a job I neither love nor dread, it’s 40hrs/week and I leave it at the door.

**1099 Income**: I officiate youth sports (hockey, lacrosse, football, baseball).  I cultivated this as a crutch to stave off job anxiety before reaching “fuck this” money.  I’ve dialed things back considerably since then, but maintain some participation in all of them in the event I need to ramp it back up.  I’ve averaged $5,000 per year with a max of over $9,000 the year I bought my home (both before expenses).  If desired I could probably push as high as $14,000 before it impacted my day job. 

**Budgeting**: I’m a natural saver, so I put little effort into this.  I track spending against take home pay from my W2 job with a general goal to stay in the green each month.  To this point I haven’t seen any concerning habits, monthly spending is consistent and the occasional red month isn’t a concern. 

**Savings**: Early on I focused on EF and taxable brokerage, I paid into my 401k enough to get my employer match through 2014, starting in mid-2015 I learned about the conversion ladder and shifted over to reaching the annual max.  I fell just short in 2015 and have maxed it out since.  I started a Roth IRA in 2016 and have maxed since.  I’m projecting an additional $12,000 into taxable brokerage per year, but this may not be sustainable.  Halving that will delay my FI date by one year.  I started maxing my HSA in 2016 after smaller contributions in years prior.

**Mistakes**: You folks are probably on the ball enough these are pretty simple and obvious.  They have been touched on earlier but I’ll highlight them here:

* Did not take advantage of 401k max limit not knowing there was means to access the money for an early retirement
* Was lazy about opening an IRA and at the least should have contributed in 2014, 2015.  When I finally started one and was done 10 minutes later I felt like an idiot for procrastinating.  Because I was.
* Spent my early years picking individual stocks, oops.  I don’t *think* I paid a heavy idiot tax here, but I’ve never properly analyzed.  At best it was a lot of effort, worry, and frustration to lag the market a bit. 
* I scrapped way too low when buying my house.  Thankfully it worked out but it’s hard to look back and think that was the right time.

**Miscellaneous takeaways**:

* I love paying my bills each month, I get a reward at the end of tallying up my accounts once a month.  Not the impression I get from others in my day to day life.
* I’ve seen some debate here over home ownership on the road to FI.  My experience lands me healthily in the pro column, but that obviously depends on the person, goals, and location.  It’s been an okay financial choice and is nice for a consistent COL I can project forward, but I’d pay a penalty for aspects that don’t fit on a spreadsheet. 
* Seeing my goal saves me from mindlessly “doing my best” to save.  I’m happy enough with it and my life I don’t need to chase a different job, work more 1099 hours, rent out part of my home, etc. 
* Financial security is an incredible stress reliever.  My industry has frequent layoff cycles and when they hit my only concern now is ensuring I get items with sentimental value from my desk.

1166,The Three Key Laws For Financial Freedom You Taught Me (Thanks!!),,648,997qa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/997qa7/the_three_key_laws_for_financial_freedom_you/,1534890555.0," 

I didn’t think I could do it, but thanks to this sub I’ve gone from debt to assets greater than six figures. Sure it took me years and I have a long way to go. But I know why I’m doing okay - you guys. You taught me. The three most important things you taught me are good investments, meal prep, and negotiating for what I’m worth. 

**1. Index Investing** 

Before I found this sub I didn’t know what index investing was. Because I’m not wealthy, any investments I would have made in funds would have been hurt significantly because of the fees. For me, index investing works because the fees are so low. I don’t know if it’s the perfect investment strategy, but I guarantee it’s better than leaving it in the bank. 

**2. Don’t buy lunch and dinner. Meal prep!**

I’ve made Sunday nights my meal prep time. I go to Aldi and buy everything I’ll eat for the week. Eating out once a day will cost $100+ at least. Now all my meals cost less than $100. 

Some secrets for eating on a budget are cheaper cuts of meat, beans, and a crockpot. 

People argue that time could  be spent working, but we can’t work 16 hours a day (at least productively). Put on some music, and use your meal prep time as relaxation. 

P.S. Making coffee at home will save you another $50 per week if you’re a caffeine addict like me. A coffee machine is an expensive purchase, but pays for itself within months.  

P.P.S. At the start I was too strict, and wouldn’t go out with friends to restaurant as much. I find it more healthy to indulge with friends occasionally. I like to think of it as a reward for 

**3. Negotiating for what you’re worth.**

As awkward as I found the conversations, negotiating for a raise was worth the two raises I’ve gotten. A book I read helped me, ‘Never Split The Difference’ by Chris Voss. I took two tactics from it. The first is to mention a ballpark figure or what other companies are offering, rather than what I want. For example, I’ll say company X is offering $35 per hour for a similar position (even if I’m after only $29). The second tactic is to ask for a very specific number, such as $29.85 because it sounds like a thoughtful calculation rather than something to be negotiated down. 

**Summary:** The three most important things you taught me are good investments, meal prep, and negotiating for what I’m worth. ",financialindependence

A lot has happened since then; so here's an update since I promised to document and share my FI/RE journey.

My employer offered me a significant, 6-figure raise, and allowed me more freedom to structure my teams and to pursue some of my previously proposed agenda in my capacity as an IT executive.

I took the golden handcuffs. The money is great. Work isn't too terrible. So as of right now I've reset my RE clock for a postponement of 6 months to a year.

It was a hard decision. While the extra earnings in 6 months to a year could finance many years of expenses in retirement, is it going to be worth the sacrifice of my time?

Will I regret this decision? I guess I will find out in the next few months. Will be sure to share with you guys.

I'd be happy to hear any thoughts you may have.

100k doesn’t seem like a lot, but it’s a huge milestone for us. We don’t make a ton of money for our area and having three children is pricey. We also get no matching contribution to an RRSP.

I had kind of a realization that the main reason I have been planning out an FI track the last couple years is because I am too lazy and undisciplined to focus on my profession and career growth, and the associated sacrifices. Not because I want the freedom to pursue other endeavors. 

I have a pretty great career (aerospace engineer) which is relatively high paying but to be honest I really don't care about it outside of the occasional interesting challenge. I am a good worker but I essentially have no interest in advancing and 'climbing the ladder'. I have an inkling it is for negative reasons, like that I am unconfident in my abilities and the competitiveness, so rather than try to play the game I resign to the fact that I am where I am, but that I can focus on saving (the easier sacrifice to me), and check out entirely 20+ years ahead of everyone else. 

I really do not relate to my peers' focus and hustling in their careers. Even while finding my work engaging and challenging at the end of the day in the office I'm thinking ""what the hell am I doing here"". I feel ambivalent about it, like I should be focusing passionately on something rather than just accepting my current trajectory to retirement, but I also don't feel particularly drawn to anything else. Other than just simply not having to go to work. Is this a normal attitude to have? are others simply better at faking it and disciplining themselves to care? I could use some wisdom if this seems relatable.

We had $15k for emergency savings, a taxable $50k in VTSMX, and combined incomes approaching $200k.  Remaining mortgage was ~$95k on a home worth ~$210k.

&nbsp;

**We had to decide, what to do with our extra savings?  Do we invest it or do we pay off the house?**

We decided to pay off the house.  Every spare dollar went towards that effort and that goal provided incredible clarity as to where our money should go.

*Two months after paying off the house, my wife lost her job because the company was facing financial hardships.*

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**And it was no big deal.**  She was able to take 4 months off to finish projects around the house, regroup, and find another job.  It was wonderful and gave her a chance to experience what FIRE could be like.

There's a lot of debate as to whether or not people should pay off their mortgage early, but for us in our circumstances, it made sense to do so and we're so happy we did.

Here is my experience with about 6 years of steadily contributing my salary into paying off debts and investing. My salary has not changed much unfortunately the past 5-6 years (ranging from 0-2% growth)  Its hard to see exactly when the curvature starts, but you can definitely see it start taking off around the 3-4 year period and in the 6-7 years you can see the rate of growth increases.  Looking forward to seeing the curve get steeper and ultimately for the annual rate of growth to exceed my salary contributions (not holding my breath for that one).

That said, I am pursuing it 100% either way - this is more for discussion.


1. Spending: If everyone stopped wasting money on discretionary goods and decided to wholeheartedly pursue FIRE by cutting all unnecessary spending, I know for a fact that my own employer (e-commerce for homegoods) would be out of business. With a consumption-dependent economy like the USA has, I can't shake the feeling that those sweet returns on my index funds might shite the bed if everybody stopped ""wasting their money"" and lots of big companies started doing way less revenue.


2. Early retirement: This one is a bit weaker because there will always be people who are coming up in the workforce and needing to save money. BUT for arguments sake - don't we also depend on people who will be ""working slaves"" their whole lives? The world will only keep going 'round while we enjoy our early retirements day-to-day at the bank, the store, etc. if there are people who are like most Americans.

Will likely buy a house again for around $400k, leaving us $500k to live on.

All you need to know in order to do well in life is to understand that every decision and every purchase you make, is a trade off. Even if you are lucky enough to have near unlimited funds, your time is finite. And spending your time (and money) means you are making trade-off.

This is neither a good thing nor bad thing nor a positive thing nor a negative thing, it just is.

Some people are young and single and don't really know what they want out of life and will chart a new course when they find a partner and perhaps start a family.

Others will find that they no longer hate their job once they're 10 years in and now have more autonomy and can work on projects they find interesting.

Some will tire of living an ultra frugal lifestyle.

Others will decide they prefer a lower paying job that they enjoy rather than grinding at something they hate in their quest for FIRE.

Some will get fucked by a poor investment choice.

Others will lose enthusiasm during a recession.

Others still will lose their highly lucrative job and never find another one.

I didn't come here to complain about life or start an argument, just to share that it IS possible to at least make some progress. Thank you ALL for your kind words, it means the world to my spouse and I. :)

I know this sub is full of personal stories, but what the heck, here's mine.... 

I'm a semi regular here, but posting from a new account to stay somewhat anonymous. 

I grew up in a cult. Lots and lots of kids, religion, a hatred for government programs, but somehow my parents couldn't work, either. We were poor, like no kidding poor. I didn't know better at the time, but started to see through it all in my teenage years. 

At 17, I was kicked out (didn't go along with the cult stuff like I was supposed to), had $300 to my name, along with a bike and some super culty clothes. A skimpy part time job, and some amazing friends who took me in and let me crash on their basement floor. 

The next 2 years I spent working every job I could find, eating cheaply and scratching together money for community college tuition. Between growing up broke and experiencing my own challenges, a dollar is worth a LOT to me. 

At 19, I enlisted. While the military isn't for everyone, it's been a really good gig for me. Even on lower enlisted pay, I suddenly had $600 a check of my own money that I had no idea what to do with. Someone told me about the TSP, and I chucked the rest into savings. 

At 21, I took $20,000 that I had saved up and used it to buy a starter home. My peers made fun of me for driving a beater car, but my mortgage payment was less than their car payments. I still ate cheaply, drank only occasionally (a bar tab is basically the worst thing at that age...) and rented out rooms to make extra cash. 

Shortly after buying that first house, the military was kind enough to re-located me, leaving me with a house I couldn't sell. I rented it out, struggling with the cashflow but learning a LOT about real estate. 

Somewhere in there, I got married and had a kid, the typical 1st world life's story. My spouse isn't nearly as focused on FIRE as I am, but is frugal and happy to go along with it. I do the budget and organization myself, then we talk about our goals together. Works pretty well. 

Today, I still don't have my high school diploma, but am almost done with my bachelors degree. I just bought my 3rd house, something that I really didn't need, but I really wanted to live in. Household gross income should be close to $140,000 this year, between two salaries and the rentals. 

$100,000 in tax advantaged retirement accounts, mostly Roths.  
$225,000 in rental real estate, only $60,000 owed in mortgages.  
$300,000 personal residence, $278,000 financed.  
Cars paid for.  
Misc emergency savings, cash accounts, etc. 

Total networth of $319,000 as of my last spreadsheet update. Not too bad for a kid who was homeless and hopeless 10 years ago.

If I can do it, so can anyone else. Here's a few take-aways that I've learned: 

1, it's not always about the percentage of returns, but the overall direction. Mental focus is sometimes your biggest advantage.  

2, just be happy with less. I'm damn proud of my beater cars. 

3, even though we're not FIRE'd yet, I still have the freedom to splurge on my kid and enjoy the small things in life. 

4, sometimes doing your own research is more important than getting professional directions. Not to discount professional advice, but never solely rely on it. 

5, people are gonna make fun of you. Especially as a young adult where all your friends' pay rates are published. Now, though, I get the whole ""How did you get to be so rich!?!"" question from those same people who were laughing at me just 4 years ago. 

6, money has given me the ability to help other people, especially my younger siblings who are still coming out of the cult. That right there is powerful. If I retire a few years later because I was able to help them get through community college, it will be one thousand times worth it.

2013: Wife and I got married. I started grad school. **Net Worth: -$59,300**

2014-2015: Between scholarships and living on one paycheck and putting the other entirely to loans, we paid off grad school within a year of graduating. **Net Worth: -$48,300**

2016: Got first ""real"" job after grad school and annual household income tops $100K for the first time. We open IRAs and start investing a bit. **Net Worth: -$14,500**

2017: Daughter was born! Got a 25% raise in a new job. Had to replace a vehicle and had other unexpected expenses, but still improved our financial state enough to hit positive NW territory. Discovered r/financialindependence and started daydreaming of FI. **Net Worth: $3,800**

2018: Luck, hard work, and opportunity led to a promotion and a 60% raise. We both maxed our IRAs for the first time and put some serious money for a home down payment. (We live in an HCOL area and don't necessarily plan on buying right away, but we'd like the option if the time is right.) The late 2018 market dump shaved a bit off the top, but we were still able to improve our financial position by nearly as much as the previous three years combined. **Net Worth: $63,900**

Looking forward: My employer will start offering a 401k in 2019, which we will be maxing along with our IRAs. Everything else will go towards rounding out our down payment fund. After we hit that goal, we'll take a nice vacation somewhere and then start putting extra into a taxable brokerage.

Why not share our plans and progress here.,,629,930ozg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/930ozg/any_fellow_third_world_citizens_trying_to_reach/,1532921540.0,"Like you all, I also make shit money and am struggling to get a job, and constantly envious of our first world friends making much much more at 20 haha, but oh well. :) Best advice ever given to me was, ""If you want to make money, make American money"" or other higher currencies.


**Let's share our progress and plans here. I'll start.**

I'm a (pushing-) 24-year-old Malaysian living in a small city. Graduated a year ago with no stable job yet. No student debts thanks to sidejobs and frugal-living during college. Still learning about finance slowly since we severely lack resources to learn about these things.


**Current progress (if you can call it that)**

I'm currently working as a substitute teacher, salary is about RM54 per day (~$12). The salary used to be RM100 (~$24) per day for my level of qualification (undergrad) but the previous government went into so much debt that every sub teacher got paid by highschool qualification, regardless of their real qualification.

Since college, I also do freelance work, which pays anywhere between RM500 to RM2000 (~$120 to ~$470) per job. I usually get one job every one or two months.  Our country's financial condition is improving since the thieves are no longer in power but at 24, I think I should have more than RM5K in my savings.


**Spendings**

I'm a rather frugal person, many of my clothes are years old (not rags though). Not really into gadgets, eating out etc. Only guarantee spendings are:

Jiujitsu classes (~RM200 monthly)

Guitar maintenance (RM100/- yearly)

Books (RM150/- yearly)

Steam sales (RM100/- yearly)

Internet plans (RM50/- monthly)

Other hobbies are mostly free (drawing, etc)


**Plans**

I'm going to grad school this September, but one half of the motivation to do so is to be in the capital city to look for more job opportunities. The plan is to work while studying, improving my network and getting employment once I graduated. Getting into IT, specifically system design & instructional technology.


**Employment landscape (as far as I know)**

Jobs are scarce in smaller cities, since our country is still developing & we are recovering from the mess made by the previous government. The people have always depended on the government to provide them jobs, this makes it common to view private companies as unsafe. IDC, I just want a job that pays well. For now I'll settle for anything RM1500/+ monthly (~$357). Low, yes, but for now...


**End-goals**

First goal is to make a stable income by 28 (~RM3K monthly), then by 35 or so, to reach the limit of RM200K (~$48K) in a local investment plan that would net me ~RM15K (~$3.6K) interest per year. I'm hoping to reach financial independence by 40. Not necessarily retiring but stable enough to live frugally yet comfortably with minimum impact in case there's an economic shitstorm, getting laid off, etc. 

Will continue to learn about investments & making side money (rent, etc). Very open to move to better countries should the opportunity presents itself.

**So...**

Anything I can improve here? My plans are very pathetic but that's what I got so far. Been wanting to FIRE before knowing it's a thing. Or perhaps it's impossible by default for those unlucky enough to not be born in a developed country?

I'm ""the boss"" in this story. I usually manage managers, who manage managers, who manage teams of engineers. In the one specific case I'm talking about, I also had a team of engineers temporarily reporting to me (due to some reorgs I was doing). I got to know the team, and it was pleasant to be directly managing engineers again. It's very different working closely with engineers, as they usually have a very different viewpoint (and needs) than managers.

Anyway, I had a very skilled engineer come to me, and explain that he was going to go to a small company for fun. I asked for details, and as usual for skilled talent, tried to convince him to stay. I looked into the finances, and started off by explaining how much more he would make at our company. He then went into the story about his investments, side business, real estate investments, etc. Essentially, making money wasn't critical anymore to his long term success.

Of course, this type of information made my job more difficult. But being financially independent didn't change how valuable he was to the company. I switched my tactic from bribing him to stay using money, to bribing him by widely letting him do whatever the heck he wants at our company. I convinced him to stay by essentially letting him work on the one pet project he found interesting.

Over the next couple years:

1) He regularly skipped our morning meetings. He said he didn't feel like waking up early sometimes. His management (me, and eventually someone else) had nothing other than ""please?"" to demand things, because he had the power in this relationship.

2) He delivered amazing work, as long as he was excited about it. At any moment, if he looked bored, I absolutely jumped to offer him other ideas of things to work on. Again, he had the power to leave at any moment, so it was my responsibility to keep him happy.

3) We gave him very nice raises. Again, he was useful to the company, and we knew he had plenty of options in how he could spend his time. Rewarding him financially might not have been necessary, but it was a small lever we could use to try to keep him happy.

4) We had a very different relationship than other engineers on the team. He had the skills, and we had a list of things we needed to get done. I would ask him essentially ""favors"", like ""We have a big presentation coming up, and I'd really like this new system to have a working demo. Do you think it would be possible to get that done before Wednesday?"". And he'd decide if he had the time, and felt like putting in the hours. In many ways, it was the best working relationship I had. We were collaborating together, it was a good partnership.

Eventually a couple years later he had another opportunity in a geographically different place, and departed on great terms.

So the keys I wanted to share with everyone are:

1) In many places, F-You money should be ""No thanks"" money. You don't need the power to ""stick it to the man"". Just take away the power for anyone to ask things from you, when they have an ability to take away something. If you don't ""need"" money, you can finally say ""no thanks"". And that's all that is probably needed most places.

2) His co-workers deeply respected him. They knew he was FI. They knew he had great skills. They fully understood he was working with us by choice, and so he had a special position. Rather than feel resentment, everything I saw was about his co-workers attempting to emulate him. Multiple people on the team asked about advice on their startups, real estate investments they were considering, and of course his coding ability. And I specifically had his co-workers say statements like ""I fully understand why ##### works on whatever he wants... we certainly don't want him leaving!""

3) Your bosses aren't always going to be jerks. There are plenty of us out here who are fully thrilled that you're FI, and are working on it themselves ;)",financialindependence
1196,"An informal review of several robo advisors from someone who doesn’t use any of them (Personal Capital, Wealthfront, Schwab)",,627,jswrdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jswrdq/an_informal_review_of_several_robo_advisors_from/,1605195635.0,"I wanted to look into robo-advisors to see if I could automate/optimize my tax-loss harvesting strategy, as that’s the one part of my portfolio that’s not “set and forget”. My thoughts on each brokerage I looked at are below.

tl;dr: I don’t want to pay the fees, and I’m just going to keep Bogling it up with my two-fund portfolio

#Personal Capital
I’d been ignoring Personal Capital’s calls for years, but accidentally answered recently thinking it was a call regarding my mortgage refinance. I thought “what do I have to lose” and scheduled two sessions with their advisor.

**Fees and minimums**

Minimum investment $100k.  
Very steep expense ratio of 0.89%, dropping to 0.79% when you hold over $1MM with them. Honestly, you can stop reading here and scroll to the next section.

**Automation**

At the time of my call, I was in the middle of shuffling some money around and had $10k in cash, plus some RSUs I hadn’t yet sold and indexed, and they spent a while saying that one of the benefits of using their service is handling that sort of thing automatically. I can’t imagine an extra couple weeks of “time in the market” would beat their ongoing expense ratio.

**Allocations**

All of the below is for my risk level, a lower risk portfolio will be different.

They suggested 70/30 US/International, I currently have 67/33. I rebalance via my contributions, but they’d be rebalancing in the traditional sense, which of course becomes more important when you’re out of the accumulation stage.

Instead of tracking the total market, they target an even split between Value/Core/Growth, with 40% allocation to mid and small caps. They pick about 90 stocks, and it seems that they use index ETFs for the small cap portion.

I’m not sure the small cap premium still exists, and this seems like a lot of extra work to diversify. They didn’t send over any backtesting showing this beating the market.

They recommended 10% to various alternatives.  
This would be buying some REITs, allocating 1.5% of my portfolio to gold, some other metals, etc. I’m a big gold skeptic, but I can’t imagine 1.5% would make or break anything. I might take a second look at REITs in my tax advantaged accounts, but I likely won’t purchase any, as I get enough exposure to real estate via VTI and through simply owning my house.

**Performance**

They say your annual return can be enhanced by up to 4.89%, but 1.5% is behavioral coaching, 0.2% is disciplined rebalancing, 1% is tax optimization, and 0.39% is smart weighting. If you’re a typical retail investor in need of a bit of behavioral coaching that’s one thing, but for the average person here these numbers are less attractive. 

**Smart Weighting**

Instead of tracking the total market, they target equally allocating 10% each to ten different sectors (tech, energy, healthcare, etc). They show the “periodic table of US sector returns” showing how different sectors over/underperform the market in different years, and how rebalancing to maintain an equal weighting between sectors captures gains and buys stocks when they’re low. They show some backtesting showing a 0.7% increase in annual returns, with a 0.8% decrease in standard decimation since 1990.

Their reasoning for rebalancing makes sense, but obviously doesn’t overcome their 0.89% fee. 
However, it makes me consider funds like the Russell 1000 equal weight ETF (EQAL) which has a 0.20% ER. Since it’s inception in 2015, however, EQAL has had less than half the inflation-adjusted return of VTI.

I’m wondering what the problems with this methodology are in theory. Too many realized gains when rebalancing? The additional bookkeeping needed to keep track and the fees associated with that? Or just that sectors naturally aren’t equal, and we shouldn’t expect the same growth from each one? Comments certainly welcome.

Ultimately, I think I’ll stay the course with good old VTI/VXUS.

**Tax management**

Tax efficient asset allocation, not picking mutual funds with high turnover, and performing tax loss harvesting. Already doing my best to do all of these. I’m rather concerned about taxes with the frequent rebalancing, so I’m not sure I think I’d get much alpha here from the automated TLH.

**Other**

They have one of the highest average balances when you look at their AUM divided by number of users, around a half million per user, meaning the average user is paying around $4k a year for this service. No wonder their budgeting software is free.

#Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium
I’ve been a Schwab client for a long time, originally due to their no-fee bank account, and now the simplicity of having my bank account and brokerage under one roof. They offer low (but not zero) fee index funds. I currently do not subscribe to their paid service

**Fees/Minimums**

Flat fee of $300, plus $30/month.  
Beats Personal Capital at $40k invested, Wealthfront at $144k, so definitely a cheaper option for people on their way to FI. Of course, you pay the ETF fees as well

Minimum $25k invested, tax loss harvesting starts at $50k
Comes with access to certified financial planner, automatic rebalancing, tax loss harvesting

EDIT: /u/veezbo pointed out that their non-premium version is free which is even better than a flat fee, but the below points on performance still stand.

**Allocations and performance**

You need a minimum 6% cash allocation, which seems insanely high to me.

They offer a few portfolios, but I’ll compare to their “global aggressive growth” since that seems the closest to my 2-fund strategy

This uses 94% stocks, 6% cash, and has had a [3.67% annualized return since inception on 3/31/15 to 6/30/2020](https://content.schwab.com/intelligent-portfolios/historical-performance/)

VT or a rebalanced 67/33 portfolio [returned 6.2/7.2% over that time (4.5/5.5% after inflation)](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2015&firstMonth=3&endYear=2020&lastMonth=6&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=VT&portfolioName2=67%2F33&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VT&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VTI&allocation2_2=67&symbol3=VXUS&allocation3_2=33)

I can’t tell if Schwab’s number is before or after inflation, but they seem to have missed out an a lot of the bull market’s growth. Past performance blah blah blah, but that’s not great for an “aggressive” 94% stock portfolio. Don’t see any data on volatility.

**Tax loss harvesting**

Primary and alternate ETF, rebalanced when over a certain threshold. This is what I’ve been doing manually this whole time.

**Summary**

While I like the flat fees, their poor performance and high cash allocation means if you’ve got $1MM with them, you’ve got a whole $60k doing nothing, and $940k in a strategy that’s underperformed the market. Not great.

#Wealthfront
As a math nerd, I greatly appreciate the [data Wealthfront publishes regarding their methodologies.](https://www.wealthfront.com/methodology)

**Fees and minimums**

0.25%, plus fund fees of 0.06%-0.13%.  
$500 minimum, but more to qualify for some of their services that matter.

**Tax management**

Stock level tax loss harvesting starts at $100k invested, but surprisingly doesn’t seem to outperform ETF-level tax loss harvesting by much. Some comments on Bogleheads mention that this makes it very difficult to untangle your portfolio when you’re selling off or moving away from Wealthfront. If you have >$1MM invested, you could have your portfolio spread across 1000 individual stocks.

It looks like you can exclude certain companies from this stock level TLH, which is useful for those of us who get stock compensation from our employers. They advertise it as a way to do socially responsible investing.

**Allocations**

At $500k invested, Wealthfront offers the ability to index by risk factors instead of market cap. I’ll let their whitepaper in the link above speak for itself, but it seems to have had higher returns than VTI when backtested back to 2000, but lower returns since they started this service in 2017. Looking at figure 2 in their paper, the year 2000 is right before a period where their strategy has its highest overperformance, so backtesting to different dates may show lower performance.

For those of you with a bond allocation, they offer a “risk parity” service for a fee, where leverage is used to match the standard deviation of a specific stock/bond allocation, but with volatility evenly spread between asset classes. Their explanation makes sense, but using leverage to buy bonds makes me uncomfortable for reasons I don’t have enough of a grasp on economics to explain. Not sure if there exists a Monte Carlo tool that can easily test this strategy to see if the failure rate for a certain WR changes, as I’m less concerned about average return here, and more concerned about risk of ruin. I’d be concerned that a matched standard deviation might not necessarily match kurtosis, and you might wind up a small risk of a large failure. They don’t allow you to put more than 20% into this strategy, so maybe my paranoia is justified?

I’d appreciate comments on these methodologies from someone who’s more familiar with the academic works referenced in their whitepapers.

Edit: /u/internet-poster's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jswrdq/an_informal_review_of_several_robo_advisors_from/gc3djxw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) shows just how terribly Wealthfront's strategy performed during the pandemic.

**Other**

Doesn’t take outside holdings like your 401k into account like Personal Capital might, so you’ll have to keep the big picture in mind yourself.

As a millennial, the only thing I dislike more than the negative millennial stereotypes is pandering to millennials. Their site describes their service as “robo-investing for millennials” or the even-more-irritating “self-driving money™” and they’ve portrayed us as a bunch of [brunch-addled shoe photographers.](https://imgur.com/a/rOMmmUo)

#Betterment
Charges the same 0.25% fee as Wealthfront or 0.40% if you want to have support from real live humans. 0.10% discount on the balance over $2MM. Offers the choice of a socially responsible portfolio and helps you donate appreciated shares to charity.

Only has half of what Wealthfront offers, and doesn’t seem writing more about. Skip the fees and handle your own donations.

#Vanguard Personal Advisor Services
Nearly forgot about this one, despite being very happy with my IRA at Vanguard.

Minimum $50k, 0.30% fee on balances below $5M with lower fees at higher balances.

Seems to be mostly advice (it’s in the name) and rebalancing. Not worth it for me.

From what I can tell, they don’t directly TLH, but you can opt-in to a “mintax” accounting method that sells lots with the biggest losses first and the largest short-term gains last. Review over.

You can also choose a “digital advisor” for a 0.15% fee. Seems to be just a 4-fund portfolio, plus access to some online calculators/tracking tools.",financialindependence

In the spirit of the [Bogleheads contest](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=299018), and in light of the extreme market volatility we are seeing this year,  I thought it would be useful to hold a contest of our own.

1200,"What I learned on the journey to save my first $100,000",,627,56as9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/56as9w/what_i_learned_on_the_journey_to_save_my_first/,1475837811.0,"Hi folks,

After recently hitting the six figure milestone, I’ve been doing a fair bit of reflecting on the journey to date. I thought I’d share some of the things I learned here, because I don’t really know anyone in real life who can relate!


**Background**


I’m 25, and lived in New Zealand up until a few months ago. It took me three-and-a-half years to get from a big fat nothing to $100,000. (In US dollar terms, it would have taken me another six to 12 months.)


I was working as a business journalist; naturally frugal-minded but still very much plugged into the consumer dumbass matrix. By chance I stumbled across Mr Money Mustache and Jacob Fisker, and even did an interview with MMM. My eyes started to open, and I read everything I could find about FIRE.


Around the same time I was starting to get bored at work. I made a promise to myself that if I could save $100k, I would quit my job and take a mini-retirement. I really wanted to travel, plan business opportunities, help out friends, and pursue other interests I hadn’t time for.


Now I’m doing exactly that, and I’ve got to say it’s even sweeter than I anticipated.


Here are some of the things I’ve learned:


* Mainstream money advice blows. I should know, because I wrote a lot of it myself. It’s all sensible stuff, but I can’t help thinking it’s fiddling while Rome burns. I still write an advice column, so the challenge I’ve set myself is to become an evangelist for simple living and frugality.


* The number itself is meaningless. I was momentarily stoked when my spreadsheet ticked over to six figures, but went right back to enjoying life. I was already travelling and working on the things I’d been dreaming of for ages, which was by far the biggest buzz.


* I’m pretty sure that without having those intrinsic goals firmly in mind, it would have been way harder to stay motivated hit the external goal, which was just an arbitrary round number.


* Once I had the right mindset and vision (spew!), the actual spending behaviours weren’t that hard to change. I grew up poor and was frugal by necessity, so maybe it’s a tougher transition for someone starting from the opposite direction.


* I found other people’s attitudes and expectations to be more of a challenge. It’s tough to explain to your mates that you don’t want to do Expensive Thing X – not because you’re a fun-hating miser, but because you have different goals and priorities to them. My strategy was just to bite my lip and take the teasing, but maybe I should have tried harder to communicate. I recently published a blog post where I “came out” to my friends, and got a really good response. Once they could see what I was doing, they were actually pretty excited about it.


* I used to fantasise about early retirement all the time. God knows how many office hours I spent daydreaming and running the numbers over and over. I was sure that I was going to do a MMM and put my feet up in my early 30s. At some point along the way, my feelings changed.


I realise now I’m happy to amble towards financial independence slowly - even if it means two steps forward, one step back - because there are certain things I want to do while I'm young.


The 'classic' FIRE path for me would involve sticking it out in a corporate job for another 10 to 15 years. The whole time, I'd be cursing myself for being too gutless to try the things I'm really excited about, like writing a blog, starting my own business, or travelling extensively. It'd be a safe but unfulfilling pathway.


Even if I start a business and it fails (which statistically speaking is the probable outcome!) I know I have the skills to rebuild my net worth and FIRE by returning to conventional work. At the same time, nothing will take away the satisfaction from the experiences and personal projects I’ve enjoyed along the way.


**THE END**


Sorry for the long post! Sure does feel good to unload though. If anyone has any thoughts, criticisms, or questions, I’d love to hear them.",financialindependence

1202,FIRE - A story from a Mexican guy.,,623,b00gvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b00gvp/fire_a_story_from_a_mexican_guy/,1552346848.0,"I worked for about 10 years in the Maquiladora Industry in Mexico, and that was enough due to the poor work-life balance, 12 vacation days per year and at least 48 working hours per week, Mexico has the highest working hours in the world. 

Maquiladoras are established in Mexico to take advantage of the low wages and proximity to the USA. Mexico has one of the lowest wages in Latin America. In 1999, the net wage for the average maquiladora worker was $56 USD per week, and twenty years later in 2019 the net wage is no more than $65 USD.  

In addition to the low wages and disregarded labor standards, the living and health conditions around these factories are beyond belief. Many people live in a squalid grid of dirt streets, rotting garbage, open sewers with unsafe water, overburdened or non-existent schools, violence and crime. But do not misunderstand me about maquiladoras, any other sector is about the same or worse; in 2019 the official minimum wage is less than 9 USD per day. There is tremendous inequality, Mexico is on the bottom 10 countries on wealth distribution (Gini Index 0,49; World Bank, Taking On Inequality, 2016).

When you focus on what you want, work hard and take the opportunities life offers, there is a possibility it will improve your life overall, and it did to me. I am a chemical engineer who climbed up the organizational ladder quickly, at age 29 I got my first management position. That gave me the possibility to buy a condominium by the beach and pay it off in three years, I bought in cash a nice Audi and saved a decent amount of money; I was living a pretty comfortable life. But I was unhappy, not even a $80K job a year, at age 33 could buy me happiness. However, it did buy me something – the ability to say goodbye. 

Lifestyle design is all about changing the way we live so that we can fulfill our passions and experience life now. I am striving for early retirement from not fulfilling jobs. One of the best ways to start on that path is to substantially reduce non-essential consumption to be able to effectively retire early.

I do not want to retire from work. I just want to retire from work that no longer challenged or motivated me. I still want to continue working on interesting projects and learn new things. I want to do more good in the world. I want to tackle inequality, environmental issues and the unsustainable lifestyle of most people. Thus, I have sold my car, and got rid of most of my possessions to focus on experiences and sustainable living over consumption.

If you could live on $1000 per month ($12,000 per year) and you made 6% annually from safe investments, you would only need to have $200,000 saved to retire. ($200,000 X 6 % = $12,000 per year) Alternatively, if you only have $100K saved and could make $500 per month from passive income like rental income from your condominium, or some internet business, then you could effectively retire now. There are many countries where you can live on 1000 USD a month.

I believe this kind of freedom is at the heart of what drives my generation. No, not everyone wants to get rid of his possessions or live on 1000 USD a month, but we want to be able to do what we want to do and still provide a worthwhile product or service to society. We want to have a purpose, and when we cannot get it in our current environment, we are willing to make a change.

Tremendous inequality and disparities in access to resources are factors that pose serious threats to human rights and to the world. It is obvious something needs to be done, we need to rethink how we live and what kind of planet we want to inherit to future generations.

While there is life, there is hope for a better and equal world.

1203,Environmentalism and FIRE,,624,czdgvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/czdgvu/environmentalism_and_fire/,1567557369.0,"Lately our family has been considering installing a residential solar system to cover most of our home electricity needs, and it got me thinking about the relationship between being financially responsible and environmentally responsible.  [After buying a Chevy Volt and adding 1,000 square feet to our house](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/), we suddenly find ourselves paying a lot more in electricity than we were before, and then realized that we could both lower that bill and significantly reduce our carbon footprint by going solar.

Back of the envelope calculations: current cost to install solar is \~$3.00/watt, so 10kW system would be $30k.  The 30% ITC tax credit reduces initial cost to $21k.  Payback period given average production of a 10kW system with \~$.11/kW utility pricing is \~**12 years**; your mileage may vary depending on your location and local tax incentives.

Over 30 years, such a system would produce \~$50k of power, or about **$30k** net after installation costs.  If you have to finance it (we're considering a cash out refinance on our mortgage), then given today's low interest rates, basically cut that in half.  Admittedly, those returns over 30 years are...well, better than wasting it on avocado toast, but obviously nothing compared to an index fund.  You should still invest in both tax advantaged and taxable accounts to build up a nest egg - but I think it's worth considering (especially for privileged folks like us) a few little projects like this that can both save  a little money and help mitigate the effects of climate change.

Of course, some people take this too far, in my opinion, to the point of sacrificing their financial security in order to be on the bleeding edge of environmental tech.  I've got friends with multiple Teslas and solar installations in houses they don't live in for the long-term; I admire their principles because they view climate change as a bigger threat than their pocketbook, but I just personally can't help but try to make some kind of financial sense out of the decisions I make.

This analysis looks to apply the Trinity Study, Vanguard Data, and statistics as reported by the US Labor Bureau to come up with a data driven definition of LeanFIRE, FIRE, and FatFIRE. Feel free to add your input and thoughts below to make this conversation even better! 

*This is just a fun table top exercise to explore the different definitions of FIRE. Never take financial advice on the internet from strangers and do not use this post as an investment guide.*


**Relevant Data and Sources in defining LeanFIRE, FIRE, and FatFIRE**


1) [1998 Trinity Study Conclusion:](http://afcpe.org/assets/pdf/vol1014.pdf)


>""If history is any guide for the future, then withdrawal rates of 3% and 4% are extremely unlikely to exhaust any portfolio of stocks and bonds during any of the payout periods shown in Table 1. In those cases, portfolio success seems close to being assured.""


2) [2012 Vanguard Update to the Trinity Study](https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/s325.pdf)


**Withdrawal rates for hypothetical portfolios based on various allocations**


*Portfolio withdrawal rates assuming 85% success rate*

**Portfolio**|**10 yrs**|**15 yrs**|**20 yrs**|**25 yrs**|**30 yrs**|**35 yrs**|**40 yrs**
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Conservative|9.3%|6.3%|4.8%|4.0%|3.5%|3.1%|2.9%|
Moderate|9.6%|6.6%|5.2%|4.4%|3.9%|3.5%|3.3%
Aggressive|9.6%| 6.7%|5.3%|4.5%|4.0%|3.7%|3.4%|

[**Notes:** For an investor with a 30-year time horizon and assuming an 85% success rate (that is, an 85% probability that a portfolio will not be depleted before the end of the time horizon), an aggressive portfolio allocated 80% stocks/20% bonds would likely have supported a 4% initial spending rate, but a conservative portfolio of 20% stocks/80% bonds would likely have supported a rate of 3.5%. Moderate = 50% stocks/50% bonds.]


3) [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm) reported in 2017 that the average American household had **$57,311** in total yearly expenditures. 


4) [2012 Vanguard Update to the Trinity Study](https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/s325.pdf)

>For a 65-year-old married couple today, for example, there is an 80% chance that at least one spouse will live to age 85, a 55% chance that one will live to age 90, and a 25% chance that one will reach age 95.


5) LeanFIRE is typically [defined](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/) as...

>...retire before 60 with less than $40k in planned yearly expenses...


6) FIRE is typically [defined](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/faq) as...

>...having enough income (from investments, passive businesses, real estate, etc) to pay for your **reasonable living expenses** for the rest of your life. You have the freedom to do what you want with your time (within reason). Working (full or part time), hobbies which generate income, or other activities are optional at this point.  


**Conclusion from Data**

For the average American, meeting annual expenses at or below $57,311 with passive/semi-passive income for the rest of their lives would be defined as FIRE. This denotes ""reasonable living expenses"" as not exceeding the total yearly expenses of an average American household. Trinity and Vanguard have confirmed withdrawal rates between 3%-4% are extremely unlikely (15% chance or less) to exhaust any portfolio of stocks and bonds. Choosing a conservative 3% withdrawal rate, retiring with **$1,910,366.67** in investments would allow one to comfortably meet an average yearly expenditure total every year without exhausting investments. A 4% withdrawal rate allows one to retire with $1,432,775.00, but this position becomes riskier the earlier one retires as evident by the Vanguard analysis. Compare this result to [FIRECalc](https://www.firecalc.com) calculations, which gives an investment amount of approx $1,812,000 as the minimum investment need to guarantee a $57,311 yearly withdrawal over 50 years of retirement for a 100% success rate throughout history.


**This would be a data driven definition of FIRE - leveraging between $1,432,775 to $1,910,66.67 in investments in order to passively earn the equivalent of what one average American household spends every year.**


For Americans seeking to fulfill a LeanFIRE retirement, meeting annual expenses at or below $40,000 with passive/semi-passive income for the rest of their lives would require a maximum investment amount of **$1,333,333.33** in order to withdraw no more than $40,000 every year without exhausting investments (assuming a yearly withdrawal rate of 3%). Many in the LeanFIRE community strive to keep annual expenses to $25,000 or even $15,000, requiring an investment amount of **$833,333.33** and **$500,000.00**, respectively, in order to meet annual expenses without exhausting investments withdrawn at a 3% rate. 


**This would be a data driven definition of LeanFIRE - leveraging between $500,000.00 to $1,333,333.33 in investments in order to passively earn the equivalent of 30% - 70% of what an average American household spends every year.**


For Americans seeking to fulfill a FatFIRE retirement, the sky is truly the limit. There really isn't a data driven definition that can be met as the FatFIRE community encourages members to reach a maximum earning potential and increase spending to whatever level their investments and net worth can support. **A minimum data driven definition could be postulated - passively earning at least twice the equivalent of what an average American household spends each year.** This requires an investment of at least **$3,820,733.33** in order to meet 2x the average American household annual expenses without exhausting investments withdrawn at a 3% rate. However, many in the FatFIRE community have annual expense rates exceeding $114,633/yr and would thus need successively higher investment amounts to meet this goal assuming they are playing by the Trinity rules.


**Summary:** 


Data indicates LeanFIRE retirement requires anywhere from **$500,000.00 to $1,333,333.33** to achieve a high likelihood of successful retirement; FIRE retirement requires on average anywhere between **$1,432,775 to $1,910,66.67** to achieve a high likelihood of successful retirement; and FatFIRE requires **$3,820,733.33** or more depending on one's personal spending and wealth accumulation goals. 


This data driven analysis is not perfect - assumptions are made to keep the math simple and the basic concepts at the forefront. 


It is also important to note this data analysis plays by the rules of the Trinity study and law of averages. Living in a HCOL or LCOL area will affect expenses as will other factors. There are also many convincing arguments one can get away with a higher yearly withdraw rate or lower total investment amount for each category. Those with high net worth will also have access to unique investment strategies that may allow for higher withdrawal rates.

1206,How do I talk about money with people midFIRE,,625,j7lw3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j7lw3m/how_do_i_talk_about_money_with_people_midfire/,1602192418.0,"This is more of a relationship post, but I don’t know where else to go.  I also wanted to know if others where having similar issues.  For context, I’m a 33 year old male. I’m having trouble talking to people about money in the last few years.  Even writing this it sounds like a giant first world, humble brag of a post.  This stuff has been bother me a lot lately, since I feel like it’s a growing divide with the core people in my life.  Around the time I hit the 200k and we all began hitting 30s it’s like something switched with my friends and I.  We have been tight since high school, and I can talk to them about anything.  They can talk to me about anything.  Essential I feel like an elitist.  There are two reasons why. When my friends and I talk about money, they say I just don’t understand their problems.  The other one is probably my problem:  when I talk about $1,000 I talk about it like they would talk about $20.

I get their money problems and half the time I’ve been the one to point out the solution (cheapest way to do something, how credit vehicles work, or refinance routes), but somehow when it comes to me trying to talk through a monetary issue they just say “you got money”.  It annoys me to no end.  The reason I have money is I pay myself first, and what is left is my budget.  My budget is $3k to spend a month, which is probably less then they do.  In my group, I’m probably the lowest earner if stock gains aren’t included (which aren’t ever took out of the market anyway).  How the hell to I get them to understand that I still have to adhere to a budget?!

My other issue is: I don’t really think about day to day spending anymore.  I mostly stick to 3k a month but I don’t feel a need to track my spending.  I’ve gotten to the move in point with my gf and we were talking about budgets.  It’s been kinda frustrating, because we are coming from very different places.  She’s learned to live without certain things, while I’m learning it’s ok to enjoy some of my money on some luxuries.  I said off handily that if we couldn’t make initial budget work I could just kick in an extra $500 a month and she told me I can’t just act like $500 has little value because that is a lot of money to her. She’s earning $34k a year and hates talking money.  Despite that she’s great with money and an amazing saver.  If she had chased money instead of passion for a career I have no doubt she’d FIRE before me.  How do I talk about our budget in a way that’s comfortable for her, and reassure her that I view our income and spending as our money?  I can bring 2k-4k to the table for our monthly expenses, but to me the question is how does she want to live preFIRE not what our budget should be?

That’s my lame first world problem.  I feel ashamed of having money lately, and I’m concerned I’m acting like an asshole about it.  No one I know has a net worth over $100k including senior family members, so I don’t really have anyone in a comparable situation to ask.  The easy answer would be to stop talking about money, but the only reason I’m good with money is I’ve been able to talk about it with the wonderful people in my life.  I’ve adapted all their good habits and it’s got me this far.  What’s everyone else’s experience?  Does anyone have any useful toss for talking money?

Edit:  you’ll are the best!!! I’m taking away from this is I need to wait for them to ask for advice and stick to concepts not exact dollars.  I feel kinda dumb for not figuring that out on my own, but hey I’m good with the financials not the emotions.",financialindependence
1207,Thoughts on FIRE and Friendship,,620,a7ynot,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a7ynot/thoughts_on_fire_and_friendship/,1545317664.0,"I've read this subreddit for years and never felt that I had anything of substance to post.  I value the ethos of FI tremendously and came across it while already doing some of the things anyways (cooking my own meals, paying down debt, investing in index funds, etc.) but wasn't truly on the FIRE path because I was wasting a lot of money on things without realizing it (cable TV, eating out at crappy restaurants too much, ordering crap from Amazon that we didn't need, etc.)

So I realize none of this is really all that unique.  What I wanted to share is that my wife and I had some friends that also discovered FIRE around the same time, and went much more hardcore into it.  They stopped going out to eat for any reason at all; would never go get a drink for any reason; would never buy something new for any reason; moved 10 states away and now live like hermits.  In essence, if an activity cost any money at all, they just wouldn't do it.  While they are definitely going to achieve FIRE earlier than we are, they've sacrificed a lot of things along the way like friendships and relationships, and it has led me to much contemplation about the differences in our paths.  Some of the relationships I've kept by doing things like going out for the occasional drink have led me to conversations about jobs and career choices that catapulted me into interviews and new jobs that have ended up tripling my income, while these friends of mine are still scraping by earning the same amount they always have.  Our savings rate of ~40% is nowhere near theirs and certainly not bragging rights on this sub, I realize, but we still have a rich social life and enjoy ourselves along the way, while our ultra-FIRE friends have faded completely from our social circle and live a pretty spartan existence. 

I realize that in itself is worth considering, too; perhaps they've chosen to remove themselves because they feel that these social connections to people that don't understand their FIRE motivation are hampering their journey.  Maybe they really are happier without having friends or ever going out for a drink.  I don't mean this post to say that they are wrong and I am right; or vice versa.  The roots of this movement were about giving up consumption and I recognize that I really haven't been able to completely do that.  The point I was really trying to make with all of this is that however you found yourself on this path, it's important to remember to think through these kind of considerations - is it worth giving up your friendships because of your dedication to FIRE?  To us it wasn't, and to our friends it was.  I wish them the best and I am a bit jealous that they'll be truly FI earlier than we will.  But I've also had a lot of really good times along the way with the friends we all shared, and there is a hole there where they are missing from it all.  
Has anyone else had these kind of thoughts or experiences along the way?  Am I going to get downvoted to oblivion for not belonging here?  I'm more curious than anything.  ",financialindependence
1208,26 Years 50% FIRE - small income country,,621,j0owcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/j0owcs/26_years_50_fire_small_income_country/,1601202358.0,"So I am 26 years, from a small country in the EU. I work as a storekeeper in a factory, and used to be a cab driver part time for a fixed per hour wage. You expected to see Entrepreneur, YouTuber or Software Developer... right?

I still live with my parents and have very little expenses, apart from taxes, gym membership and car fuel. I've been into this Retire Early mindset since I was very young. Never really saw the point of working till you're old.

So I saved and invested 95% of my net income yearly. (We're talking 15k euros per year net wage).

By last year I had about 180k euros invested in mostly local equities. Then I decided to purchase an apartment for 180k Euros (included closing fees and was undervalued by at least 30k) with 50% Down payment and keeping the other 90k in equities. I rented it out for about 8k euros per year.

Now I decided to liquidate most of the equities to try and buy another apartment but the banks didn't like the idea so I decided to pay off all my mortgage instead. I now have a fully paid apartment which is now valued at 240k.

Currently I have zero debt. I have about 20k between cash / crypto / equities. For a total Net worth of about 260k.

My goal is to purchase another apartment and fully pay it by age 31 - which would also be my lucky birthday.

Upon reaching my goal I would have approx Euro 550k net worth at 31. This would give me about 15k euros passive income per year which is 50% more than the current minimum wage in my country of 10k Euro.

I would then semi retire to a point where all the passive income is completely reinvested. Then I would just relocate to a high income country in the EU working 60hour work weeks for 3 months and save everything. Also get refunded on tax because you don't reach the thresholds for income. Then have 9 months of traveling around in low cost countries around mountains, beaches and nature. I'll get a local media company to make an article on my odd successful life and start a YouTube channel documenting my journeys.

Repeat the process for a couple more years till YouTube earnings are enough so as to never need those 3months of work a year.

&#x200B;

Being able to work 3 months a year at the age of 31 is a dream for 99% of the people including myself, but it doesn't come without some disadvantages:-

1. I would have basically skipped a decade of my life. No travels, losing friends, little social life.
2. Most people don't understand your idea of freedom and life.
3. Finding a partner with the same ideology is going to be extremely hard.

However there is the advantage that I learned to be alone. Go out alone, especially in quiet and around nature. I set gym goals at the age of 16 and 10 years later I barely do any effort to look & feel better than most people. I expanded my knowledge by completing a Diploma in Nutrition, in insurance, in IT and in Personal Training. I also find more time to read books that I borrow from libraries to avoid purchasing anything. I don't have to keep updating my wardrobe, since I barely use most of them, they look brand new hehe ;)

&#x200B;

i didn't write this post to brag. I wrote it as a means of motivation for low income people. Yeah you're going to sacrifice basically everything for just a couple of goals. But hell, once you reach them the satisfaction will be huge.

5 Years away. Let's do this.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I see that a lot of people are posting regarding living off my parents. Well yeah. What's wrong with using all the opportunities at one's disposal to reach goals? In my country people tend to live with their parents until marriage anyway.

Also, my parents have always been frugal themselves, so them helping me to achieve my targets is giving them a lot of satisfaction, although I must say they do not agree with me Retiring Early. So much so, that my father is of age to retire and get government pension and just chooses to keep working because he enjoys work. Apart from the fact that my parents have investments themselves. Let's say that they don't need my help financially.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** Geez didn't expect this amount of engagement. Here's my replies to most Questions:

* Yes, yes, everyone saying how easy it is when you have your family pay for food and you have no rent. Sure it's great and can't help but appreciate what I have, but you're just saying that to undermine the effort I put in.   
I could have done like most of my colleagues and people my age in my country, which is go abroad 3 times a year, spend all money on cars / phones / clothes and so on and have zero net worth, even though most of them have similar opportunities.  
It's not easy to basically delay gratification for 10-15 years. People can't even go a week on a diet before buying an ice-cream and I am here with little social life, few hobbies, and just work, save and invest.


* You guys misunderstood the motivation part and are focusing only on the 95% savings rate, which might be unattainable to most. Well my aim was to tell people to Delay Gratification. Because if you can save 70% and are only saving 50% because you want to enjoy life today using those 20%, well then that is your fault. I can assure you I would much rather use 15% more of my income to have a life, but then I'd have to spend more hours working.. Sacrifice Today for Tomorrow. 


* As for the YouTube thing, well getting a local media company to write an article is relatively easy to do. Will the channel be successful? No idea, but since I would be traveling anyway, might as well just video places and upload to YouTube.. 3 years later something might happen. And to be honest, if I make 5k/year from ad revenue + affiliates it would literally replace the 3 month work / year


* For those who do not understand why I will still work 3 months / year instead of just using the rental income. Well I want to get a bigger net worth and more passive income in the future, therefore I will reinvest all the rent I get and just live/travel on the wages earned that year.


* As for those saying I am not diversified. Sure, but in my country due to limited land, basically house prices always went up or went down very little (in 2008-09, they lost 4% value). So it is a stable store of value along with a good passive income. In real estate you can also use leverage to make more gains, while investing solely in stocks and ETFs is not recommended to use margin. - Although I had amassed my net worth by investing in local stocks mostly. Also, you can't really buy 5 units with 550k. 170k gets you a decent 2 bedroom in few locations nowadays.",financialindependence

Retirement/money seems to be a popular topic around the station, so I figured I would post this for anyone who searches in the future like me.  Just updated my spreadsheet today and NW topped $400K for the first time.  In 2009, our net worth was $-9000, so I'm pretty happy with this.  Also, to clarify, this doesn't include my pension, which is a defined contribution plan.  My eventual benefit will be directly tied to what I've put in, and the system I'm a part of is well-regarded for being very financially stable, so I have little worry of any future issues with it.  For those unfamiliar, general expectation is to work 30-35yrs and the pension will be equal to or greater than your salary when you retire.  In the last 2.5yrs our net worth has doubled, and the average monthly increase is slowly ticking upwards from a $2-3K/month increase, when I started keeping track, to a current level of roughly $6K/month increase in net worth.  Obviously the good market has helped the last couple years.  I max out my 457 and max out a Roth for my wife.  I had to stop contributing to my Roth, it was just too much, things were getting too tight with us and two kids.  Anyway, like I said, I just wanted to post this for any future like persons searching for a firefighter's side of things.  Thanks for reading.",financialindependence

It's not that I have no near-term goals for myself, it's just that a lot of my goals, like living overseas, just aren't feasible right.

My wife and I married three years ago and I’m so thankful that we started our marriage with a strong foundation for financial success.

Our savings rate has grown from 35% in 2016 to 42% in 2018. We are both 31 years old and our combined income is $95k. During this time, we paid off our duplex and moved into a single family house of our own. We also finished paying our modest student loans and her car payment. Most importantly, we welcomed our first son into the world last year. Although we are far from RE, I feel assured knowing that we have reached a healthy state of FI. Our assets hover around $350k (rental, 401k, IRA, and HSA) and we have another roughly $55k in home equity.

Her parents recently purchased a small lake cottage an hour north of our hometown and we are excited to spend our weekends there this summer. This place will be the setting for many family memories. This past week, we made the most anti-FIRE decision I can think of and bought not one, but two boats.  Personal watercraft, technically speaking. Although we paid cash and bought two-year-old models, we completely recognize that this purchase is pure luxury.

That said, it’s only because of FI that we feel confident in our decision to splurge. We can afford this purchase, and while it may delay our other financial goals a bit and impact our SR this year, I know that the laughs and memories will be worth the sacrifice.  I have my captains license and her family loves boating, so we know what we’re getting into with this purchase.

Not sure why I’m even sharing this, only to remind others that there are goals outside of work and money and savings rates. When an opportunity presents itself, don’t forget the real reason why we save: to ultimately enjoy quality time making memories with those we love.",financialindependence

Would think by nature of our business that we are the more detailed-oriented ones, especially when it comes to a financial/numbers perspective. Just curious to hear more stories from accountants who are on the FIRE path.

Our career path and titles are pretty standardized so I would think the motions are very similar, but any tips/advice along the way would be great to hear about.

For me personally, I've done the Big 4 route as an auditor and am now in industry as an Accounting Manager. I'm making low six-figures. I live in a HCOL area and my savings rate is about 50%. I'm still in my early 30s with about $600K in net worth. Most of my net worth build was attributed to investing in the S&P 500 and appreciation of the home I currently live in. About half of my net worth is in investments, including 401K and Roth IRA. I max out my traditional 401K and Roth IRA annually, and am hoping to FIRE in my early 50s with about $2.5M. I recently started my own bookkeeping practice as a side hustle in hopes to accelerate that even earlier.

My personal advice echoes what this sub says time and time again, which is that the best time to invest was yesterday and the second best time to invest is today. I wish I wasn't feeling so certain a recession was coming in the 2010s and I know I missed quite a rally in my personal investment accounts by having too much money in cash. Nowadays, I have set up automatic investments of $500 every two weeks into my personal investment account (VFIAX fund), and my only regret is I am not putting more than $500 (still got a good chunk in cash as a safety reserve to hopefully buy a bigger home soon).",financialindependence

Well here's my list:

1. Video games.  Despite their status as a luxury good, I challenge you to find anything cheaper on a per-hour basis.  One $60 game can give thousands of hours of entertainment.  If you can't run the latest and greatest, check out GOG.com for classics that can run on newer systems. (I have no affiliation).

2. Sunday movies.  Sunday morning and early afternoon tickets are typically cheaper, and some theaters turn a blind eye when you walk in with outside coffee.  You're less snarky and the theater is nearly empty.  The perfect cheap date.

3. Hand crafts.  If you really want a cheap hobby, take up knitting or any number of crafts.  Yes, any hobby can get insanely expensive, but they don't need to be.  For knitting, get two needles, 1 ball of yarn and make a hat.  They're cheap and make great gifts.  Start now and you'll have time to make your entire Christmas list.  And people love getting things you've made for them.  Same goes for wood carving, leather work or candle making.  Start cheap, make gifts.

4. Expensive clothing.  Here's the trick: avoid fads and logos and buy basics. Nice pants and shirts can last years if you line dry them, and they'll hold their shape too.  If you divide the cost over several years, this is a more economical way to shop in the long run, makes you feel good, and look good too.   The trick is to do this sparingly.  One big shopping trip a year, or one item every few months is appropriate.  Stick to your budget. 

5. Netflix, and other subscriptions.  Ditch cable and get a few if these apps.  It's cheaper than cable and going out.

My wife and I both work full time jobs and are in grad school, and work a night job that supplies free housing.  If we don't take care of ourselves every so often the stress would be too much.  This is how we get by while meeting our goals.

In our case, it translates to the importance of setting goals after FI. 

""In my early years, I looked up to extraordinarily successful people, thinking that they were successful because they were extraordinary.

After I got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them - like me, like everyone - make mistakes, struggle with their weaknesses, and don't feel that they are particularly special or great.

They are no happier than the rest of us, and they struggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle than glory. This has certainly been true for me. While I surpassed my wildest dreams decades ago, I am still struggling today. In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. 

To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for. Just look at people who attain their dreams early - the child star, the lottery winner, the professional athlete who peaks early. They typically don't end up happy unless they get excited about something else bigger and better to struggle for. 

Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn't just make your ups better; it makes your downs less bad. I'm still struggling and I will until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.""

Short and interesting read on a Stanford psychologist's opinion on how work culture needs to change. She suggests that our extant life patterns -- go to school until 22, work and retire at 65 -- don't fit elongating life-spans. It's a short piece and just a jumping-off point. But the gist is that the following need to become more common, lest we save our best non-working years for when we're too old to take advantage: mini-retirements, working earlier and getting advanced degrees later, and sharing generational wealth long before death.

Interested in thoughts of others on r/financialindependence because the article's suggestion of earlier mini-retirements runs counter (_I believe_) to the sub's over-arching objective of retiring early and entirely. Any thoughts on whether a higher chance at a 100-year life span affects retirement planning (sooner, repeated, etc)?

_Consequences of life extension_

> ... most people are anxious about the prospect of living for a century. Asked about aspirations for living to 100, typical responses are “I hope I don’t outlive my money” or “I hope I don’t get dementia.” If we do not begin to envision what satisfying, engaged and meaningful century-long lives can look like, we will certainly fail to build worlds that can take us there.

_Earlier and more varied work experience_

>To thrive in an age of rapid knowledge transfer, children not only need reading, math and computer literacy, but they also need to learn to think creatively and not hold on to “facts” too tightly. They’ll need to find joy in unlearning and relearning. Teens could take breaks from high school and take internships in workplaces that intrigue them. Education wouldn’t end in youth but rather be ever-present and take many forms outside of classrooms, from micro-degrees to traveling the world.

_Earlier sharing of generational wealth_

> Financing longevity requires major rethinking. Rather than saving ever-larger pots of money for the end of life, we could pool risks in new ways. Generations may share wealth earlier than traditional bequests; we can start savings accounts at birth and allow young adults to work earlier so that compound interest can work in their favor.

Pretty good read about Ryan Broyles (played for OU then Lions) and how he learned about credit and saving through the draft process.  Even those that we typically think of with the fastest, high priced lifestyle can still save and put it away.  I've seen a couple examples anecdotally about other players like this (Gronkowski lived in his parents' home for his first few seasons), but this is the first one I really saw through a prism of FI/RE.

Good for him, definitely a lot of people make money off of athletes spending theirs.  Anyways, just thought it was an interesting example of low spending & high saving in an arena we don't typically see around these parts.

NO GROWTH IN DECADES- Other empires had fall before, the US can reduce it growth considerably, it may be in a 100 years from now or as a result of mismanagement of this current crisis. Nothing is special con the US compared with other countries. It may experience a long time stagnation.

They said there were two reasons - 1) they didn’t know what to do with their time and 2) the health costs ended up being $500 more per month than anticipated for a total of $2,500 / month. 

I was a bit surprised by the $2,500 / month number and started digging into the cost of insurance vs age and it seems that insurance is an expense that out paces inflation which made me curious how to consider a cost that would grow beyond inflation annually when it comes to finding your FI number. 

Using the 4% SWR (or pick your favorite number), which grows your total expenses at inflation, how much contingency would one have to add to account for an expense ($700 / month) that grows beyond inflation (6% a year until Medicare kicks in) assuming the rest of your expenses grew with inflation?

I think it is especially useful for younger folks on here who started investing in the last decade. It was probably easy to hold and continue to buy over the minor dip we had late last year. But a 2008 level event is a different story. Shit got real. 

I will add though, my bigger fear for the kind of investing we preach here at r/FI is a Japan style flattening of the economy for a couple of decades or so. But none of us know which nightmare scenario might come to pass. Keeping expenses down will help no matter what.

An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.


The Mexican replied, “only a little while.""

The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? 

The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. 

The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”


The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life.” 

The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”

“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
“Millions – then what?”


The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",financialindependence
1237,"Before marriage, please discuss your FI-related values with your SO.",,604,5il38k,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5il38k/before_marriage_please_discuss_your_firelated/,1481846749.0,"This way I see it, this is no different than one's view on having kids. People want different things in life. Wanting to be ""childfree"" is not right or wrong. Wanting a large family of 3 boys and 3 girls is not right or wrong. But you don't want to wait until after the wedding to realize that you want the former and your SO want the later.




One obvious similarity between FI and having children is the large long-term commitment. Children comes with the responsibility of caring (and paying) for a person for around 20 years. FI also is a multi-decade long commitment that you weigh the cost of immediate benefit vs. future freedom. Again, being right or wrong doesn't come into it (at least in this discussion). Some people enjoy every moment of caring for a child, no matter if it's changing diaper or baking birthday cake; some people can't stand children. In the same way, some people enjoy watching their investments grow and some people feel that money not spent is life not fully lived.




Having the discussion is important b/c you can't assume your SO would be on-board with FI just because they don't seem to spend much money anyway. Young people do not have the societal pressure to spend money. Young people usually care more about things like having fun and growing as a person. It's often when people get older than they become more status conscious and start to consume conspicuously. I admit this is gross stereotyping but I think it's worth considering.




You might say that this discussion before marriage is irrelevant b/c people's value change in life, I would disagree. People in this sub who agree with FI values probably will not radically change their view twenty years from now. In the same way, someone who disagrees with FI values (after being exposed to it) will also find it hard to change their views. We're talking about marriage age here, at this point people's value systems are mostly set. I think it's hard enough to change someone's mind that it's easier to find a more compatible SO.




I know that people do not want this sub to turn into r/relationships. But I think there's only so much to talk about when it comes to the mechanics of FI. It's worth it to have discussions about emotional and value-based aspects of persuing FI. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, FI value does not need to be right or wrong, but it is an important part of a person's value system that affects both how s/he acts and how s/he feels.",financialindependence

A few days ago I crossed 800k and I should be able to get into the 900k's within the next 3-4 months, possibly to 1 million if things turn out good.  At that point I am going to completely quit my job as a lawyer and live in Asia for good, probably starting some part time businesses here and there. I'm 37 and can live a ""luxury"" lifestyle in SE Asia for around 20-25k a year. I've lived in Asia for over a year so I know it is more than possible.  

1. My overall portfolio is around 40% bonds, 60% stocks plus 20k in a savings account and 2k or so in checking accounts. 300k of my NW is in Vanguard Wellesley (VWIAX) in non-retirement accounts.  Should I diversify by moving 100-200k into savings in SE Asia? For instance, in some countries here you can get 6-8% interest but of course you have to convert USD into local currency. Some countries though, like Vietnam, have relatively stable currencies and economies. If I put 200k into a local savings account bearing 7% interest I am making 14k a year guaranteed, almost paying for my entire life with just 20% of my NW. 

2. I could buy a nice luxury 2 bedroom condo in SE Asia for around 125k USD. Rent on the same place would be around $850 a month. Does it make sense to buy (assume no issues with foreigners buying property)?

3. Am I missing anything? Before anyone mentions it, I don't want to get married. I don't want to have kids. And I don't particularly care about 30 years from now when I officially retire. I want to enjoy life right now and not have to work full time or live in the US. ",financialindependence

Just get to 25 x spending!"".  It felt so far away that I just set out on the path.

After years of diligent saving, I hit 4%...Then I read the Mad Fientist's post on SWR ([https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate](https://www.madfientist.com/safe-withdrawal-rate)) and figured, ""ok...maybe 3.5% just to be safe.  After all, I could live another 60 years!""

Then I hit 3.5%...I started reading ERN's SWR series and my understanding became more informed and nuanced...and possibly even more fraught with doubts[https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/)

Now I'm \~3% SWR as we hit nosebleed valuations during a raging pandemic.And I find myself thinking, no way we don't have a huge crash again.  People are being way too optimistic about this vaccine.  Even in the best of times, these valuations are bananas.  And also, don't I have a duty to work longer to fully pay for my kid's college (as my parents did for me)?  And you know what, living in a HCOL area might be cool later in life.  Oooh...and a Model Y would be rad.  I should replace my old beater before pulling the ripcord.

Note: I'm fully invested and 80% in stocks, so I'm not market timing or anything.  My feelings on current valuations never make me do anything stupid or drastically change my AA.

Right now I'm guessing many of you are thinking I deserve a good old fashioned face punch, and I probably do, but it's never too early to start mentally preparing for how you'll handle crossing the finish line.  There will be no confetti blast or congratulatory interview.  Even if you have done the work of thinking about what you want to do after your career and diligently mapped out detailed cash flow for post retirement income.  It's sort of like in my early 20's when I met with a financial advisor (before FIRE) and they have you fill out the stupid risk assessment forms.  As if you have any idea what that will feel like when the market crashes 60%, and then you go through the GFC and are like...""oh, so this is what risk feels like"".

It really boils down to confidence, personality, and being a raging optimist I think to actually walk away

Current planned length: until the end of the year, and likely longer after I get there and revisit finances. Wife works from home and handles the income right now, of which we need not much.

&#x200B;

While not exactly FIRE, it's a good preview into my life would be like if FIRE'd today. My bosses and supervisors were understanding of my decision to leave to become stay-at-home at dad. I believe being on leave for nearly 3 months made the transition out so much easier and much less of a shock to either side. My workplace had become accustomed to doing things without me, and I myself had time to ""turn it off"". Now I have little to no desire to ""turn it back on"" - I even  turned down a massive raise to go work elsewhere. Given current circumstances, my time now is so much more valuable than at say 42, 52, or 62 and beyond. I also understand the opportunity cost of taking time off at this age in my career, but YOLO and there's no guarantee of anything in the future. I can only hope and vote for the politicians who will increase the length of parental leave in the country so that all new parents both FI and non-FI can enjoy time and bonding with their little ones without having the pull the plug entirely like I did.

&#x200B;

Here's the current rough schedule of my current ""FIRE life"", because babies make having any sort of schedule difficult:

&#x200B;

* 5:00am-9:00am. Wake up and keep the baby entertained until it goes back down so my wife can catch up on some sleep. Once the baby goes back down, make tea, browse Reddit, check stocks, Bitcoin, etc. Walk to the beach with my long-board and surf. Big wave or little wave it doesn't matter. It's the best to wake up and get my day started.
* 9:00am-2:00pm. Play with the baby while my wife goes and does a few things out, then once it goes down for a nap,  browse Reddit, check stocks, Bitcoin, etc. Maybe shoot some VR video. And if surfing wasn't possible in the morning, then I may roller-blade on the beach path for 1-2 hours instead.
* 2:00pm-8:00pm. This part of the day is somewhat difficult and erratic, because the baby can be very moody. Though typically at some point I'll take him out for an hour+ long stroll, keep working on my VR video hobby. The wife and I take turns handling an errands like getting groceries, cleaning up the place. Towards the end of the week I may grab a beer at a bar with a friend for an hour or so. At night if I have energy left after he goes down, I'll just browse the web. Otherwise I usually just crash.

&#x200B;

Weekends change it up a bit since I have other activities like hockey, volleyball, or tennis that I'm involved with. I have to pick and choose which activities though, because realistically I've only got enough energy in the tank for one activity right now.

&#x200B;

Lastly, if I can figure out some sort of reliable income scheme in this time I'm taking off, I don't think I will ever go back to a salaried position. So that will certainly be a goal and focus of mine alongside helping raise the little one.",financialindependence

I remember forming the desire to be FI in my teenage years. But before that I remember believing in being good at something as in having a profession. By being confronted with the reality of the world one finds there isn't really anything worth doing other than that which leads to acquiring wealth and subsequently more freedom. In my case I especially don't have a desire of being wealthy but simply of not having to deal with work that I find meaningless. I guess maybe for people like doctors or scientists there is more meaning in what they do. I feel like choosing to become independently wealthy is downright nihilistic because on the deep level it says there is nothing worth doing in this world so I might as well live off my remaining time more comfortably.

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of FI and I'm working towards achieving it for myself but I can't help but feeling like I'd trade it off for a job worth doing.

EDIT: I might be a little messed up in the head. But I see how most agree that the important things in life aren't valued by society so we have to retreat into our little asinine corporate cubicle gigs which later accumulate into our FI nesteggs, which just equals to other people doing those asinine gigs for us, so then we can finally larp out our fantasies about how we think life should be.

To me, FI is admitting the system is broken, but instead trying to rebuild it, we're just buying ourselves a share in that system so we can get that sweet free ride.",financialindependence
1246,three years into early retirement,,603,gwrfpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwrfpj/three_years_into_early_retirement/,1591308495.0,"**BACKGROUND**

**Introduction**: As my desire to spend nearly an entire day on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. Please check comments and posts from my history to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I might no longer take the time to say so individually. I apologize if I don’t remember you individually. The usernames and stories run together. Please remind me of a discussion we had or provide a link if it’s relevant to something you want to know. The road of questions about what I do for health care (subsidies and their ambiguous morality), why retail pharmacy is so bad (below), and whether my situation is from determination or privilege (a lot of both) has been well tread.

**Model**: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My net worth at that time was $1,333,772 (portfolio plus home). My original model was a simple 3% withdrawal rate of the portfolio value. Our actual withdrawal rate has been much lower due to: occasionally earning additional income in 2017-2019; receiving an unexpected $30k windfall in 2018; and a retool of the model due to purchasing my parents home at a greatly reduced price in 2019 (more below). The maximum withdrawal amount allowed for 2020 is $5217/mo or $62,604/yr (3% of current net worth). In 2017, it was $2564/mo ($2682/mo adjusted for inflation). We’re so far out of danger by historical precedent that spending is no longer a thought.

**Career**: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated both his job and profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors (1997-2001) and a doctorate (2001-2005) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years (2005-2017, entirely with CVS). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships ($25k), employment during college ($20k), prior savings from high school employment ($5k), and revenue from an eBay business while in college ($10k). My parents initially promised to cover the remaining $90k of education expenses out of what they deemed to be pure principle, but we assumed the loan as part of the deal when purchasing their home at a reduced rate in 2019 (explanation upcoming). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. Our savings rate was about 70% on average.

**Finances**: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation was approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). After the purchase of my parents’ home/farm, our net worth is closer to 55% real estate (one house with 28 acres and another with 66 acres) / 44% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 1% cash. We also hold roughly $50k in belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), other inheritances ($???), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.


**YEAR THREE RECAP**

**Performance**: Living expenses for the third year came to $42,812 (max budget $62,604). We generated $9,514 of income this year primarily from my wife’s previous fun job and the stimulus payment. Our investment withdrawal was $33,298 this year, thus our pro-rated, annually-adjusted withdrawal rate was 1.59% for the year. Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 2.05% for the year. Our net worth went from $1,333,772 (year zero) to $1,471,164 (year one) to $1,488,092 (year two) to $2,010,995 (year three, as of June 1, technically up another $40k since then). The large jump this year was primarily due to the de facto reverse mortgage purchase on my parents’ home/farm, as well as an approximate 10% increase in VTSAX over the past 12 months.

**Purchase**: I purchased my parents’ home/farm for $460k and gave them a guarantee of free rent for life. At the time of purchase, it was worth an estimated $750k (now estimated at $835k – Zillow has our zip code increasing 30% in value in 2019 alone – crazy out here). The difference in FMV for taxation purposes is covered by the equal exchange of rent for interest (complicated, not getting into it). So why did they sell? Basically they just wanted extra cash, a guarantee of housing for life, removing the house from their name in case they ever needed means-tested assistance, and to be able to pre-gift an inheritance to their children while still alive. $250k went to them; I bought my sister out for $210k; the difference in true value and sale price was my gift; everyone is happy.

**Reflections**: I’m not particularly interested in spinning comedy this time, but it’s been a crazy year for a whole lot of reasons. Did I panic when the market corrected 40%? No. Howling monkeys are always gonna howl. I rode it out and have gotten 70-75% of the losses back. I also had to liquidate a lot of post-tax stocks in order to buy my parents’ place before the crash, so that was fortunate timing. I was re-interviewed by the NYT in a follow-up for their piece on FI. I seem to recall being the only subject who had made reasonable gains. I therefore was only a minor footnote in the piece.

**Experiences**: I ran over 3000 miles, won a few more races, and saw my competitive running career come to a close (personal records set in each distance this year: 5:12 mile, 17:37 5k, 36:39 10k, 1:17:38 HM, 2:43:12 marathon). I’m proudest of having set the fastest time ever for a 40+ year old in my hometown HM race. I continued to write in my daily journal every single day since retirement without exception (focusing on weird dreams), went back to teaching as a volunteer ESL teacher for a semester before COVID-19 (teaching intermediate level classes in English), volunteered as a three hour marathon pacer for a few charity races, squandered 300 hours playing video games (Persona 4, Persona 3, FF7 Remake, Witcher 3, Horizon: Zero Dawn), collected some more vintage sports cards (pictures of men with moustaches), spent more time with friends, participated in a financial pharmacist podcast (early retirement, if I recall the topic correctly), visited Alaska/Washington/Victoria for two weeks with my wife, revisited Japan by myself for two weeks (averaged 40k steps per day), got back into some television (Hoarders, After Life, Space Ghost: Coast to Coast, COPS, Star Trek: Picard), spent way too much time on social media trying to correct misinformation on COVID-19, and took up cycling on a pretty serious basis two months ago (marathon training carried over, so my wattage [261w / 3.6 FTP] would put me around a good Cat 4 or bad Cat 3 racer if I ever were to compete).

**Upcoming**: What lies ahead in year four? I can’t say for sure. Definitely more cycling. Possibly learn to swim without a snorkel. Triathlon? Campaign volunteering for the rational party. Definitely not returning to monthly updates. I’m kind of stuck in a rut since I’ve done most everything I wanted to do. A lot of the stuff I didn’t tackle is what I’ve lost interest in. Oh…also whatever the fuck I want. I’m supposed to say that. But seriously, I let this pandemic be an excuse for a drop in productivity. That changes now.",financialindependence
1247,Going solar by the end of the year for FIRE,,602,d8ah23,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/d8ah23/going_solar_by_the_end_of_the_year_for_fire/,1569262634.0,"Disclaimer: I live in Colorado, where the Sun shines 300+ days per year, but I suspect this would work for a large part of the US as well (Arizona, NM, TX, FL etc)

We all know that the two secrets to increase wealth: maximize revenue and minimize expenses. I want to focus on the second part here in this post.

Solar panels are getting really cheap these days (even with a 30% tariff added in Jan 2017) , and so are many used Electric Vehicle (EV) . Solar panels are costing less than $1 per watt (different efficiency varies) and with professional installations (labors, net meters etc) costing about $2 per watt. A typical 6000 watt system which on average produces about 7800 kWh a year in Colorado (650 kWh/month) would cost about $18000 installed. If you do this before the end of the year, you get a check for 30% of the total system cost from the federal government, for a total cost of about $12000. After the new year, that check would be just 26%, (next year 22%, and then 0% in 2022), and we all know which Orange American is behind this drop, but that's a political rant for another day.

A lot of cities in the US offers solar loans at about 5% APR. A quick calculation would tell you that with $0 down, the monthly payment for the system per month would be $79 for 20 years, $95 for 15 years, or $127 for 10 years. After the system pays off, your cost would be $0 a month. You could also take out a personal loan from most banks for solar projects. They could offer even lower APR. Or if you happen to have the money on hand, you could just pay it off cash.

So let's take a look at how much people could save. In Colorado, 1 kWh cost about $.11\~$.14, so let's use average $.12 for the calculation. $.12\*650 = $78. But wait! That's not all. There are also taxes and transmission cost associated with the usage, which means that you save more than that much. If you look at your power bill you can see that taxes and fees are at least 30% of your electric bills, sometimes it could be as high as 70%! So with solar power you are looking at a 0 or negative power usage for most of the year, saving you 100% of the electricity cost. In places like California, where 1 kWh costs getting to as high as $.24, your monthly cost could be $156 plus tax and fees, which means that you will be saving at least $29 a month even if you chose the 10 year payment plan. Each year, utilities companies raise the rates/fees. With your own solar system, you will have peace of mind from rising energy cost.

But wait! There is more potential savings. Most houses in the US has tanked gas water heater, which requires replacement every 8\~12 years. A tanked (50 gallon) electric water heater cost about $380 at Home Depot. So if you happen to need to replace your gas water heater soon, you can get a tanked electric water heater, and save even more: I used to pay $50 a month for gas for a family of 4. After replacing it with electric water heater, my gas bills in the summer is literally $1 ( gas pilot light for the furnace?)

But wait! There is even more potential savings. Used Electric cars are so cheap these days it is definitely worth looking into. I bought a used 2015 S Nissan LEAF with 24 kWh battery in 2016 for $9000 cash. It was a great deal. But you can surely find many sub-10k electric cars on the internet these days. And if you calculate the savings in addition to your electric costs, it is mind blowing: People casually drop $2000 \~ $4000 a year on gas alone without a second thought. That's gonna be $0 for you with the solar panels. 10 years of this you will save at least $20000, which is no small change. And then there's the maintenance savings: There is no oil change every 3000 miles; no spark-plug change, no tune-ups, no transmission fluid flush, no $500 \~ $700 average maintenance each year associated with the dirty gasoline engine. There are various subs for EV's on reddit you can refer to.

1248,First Full Calendar Year RE’d. Finances better than expected!,,601,ad99dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ad99dq/first_full_calendar_year_red_finances_better_than/,1546805249.0,"**2018 summary**: Excluding healthcare and taxes, I spent $21k. I spent $7.5k on healthcare, and expect to spend about $3.5k on taxes, so my total expenses will be about $32k. I earned $41k from rent, interest, dividends, and a few other small things. 

&#x200B;

**Thoughts and Plans**:

* I had no major house or car expenses this year, so I expect my expenses will be higher on average in the future 
* During the year I realized I was being a little more “cheap” than “frugal” with friends/family/roommates. It’s hard for me to turn this off, so I’m setting aside \~$3k toward not being cheap with other people, which will increase my spending by $2k next year
* Healthcare remains by far the biggest uncertainty for me
* I want to save money now to help manage future uncertainties, like not having roommates, healthcare costs going up, or starting a family

&#x200B;

**Background from previous posts**: I left a good job in my mid-30s due to chronic pain. I had been working toward a regular-FIRE in about 5 years, but due to circumstances I thought it made more sense to lean-FIRE immediately and focus on my health. So I FIRE’d in early 2017, a mid-30s guy with no wife or kids. It was definitely the right decision for me, as my physical health has improved a bit, and my mental and emotional health have improved a ton.

&#x200B;

**Strategy**: Moved out of paid-off downtown condo in MCOL city, into a large paid-off house in the suburbs where I rent out 3 rooms. I rent for slightly under-market so I can pick roommates I really like. It’s paid off financially, and I like my roommates. The rest of my money is invested mostly in income producing assets, like high dividend yield funds, REITS, and Bonds.  I also 2-3 years of expenses in vanguard's MMA and rolling 1-yr CDs. 

&#x200B;

\* Mentally, I find it much easier to “live off my income” rather than having to sell my assets to get by. I know it’s not totally rational. But one of the best things I’ve done for my emotional health is to accept that I’m not 100% rational, and to balance what is rationally the right decision with things that make me emotionally stronger.

1249,Coward no more.,,604,9i1fso,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9i1fso/coward_no_more/,1537637401.0,"I'm the [fucking coward](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/90q4kh/im_a_fucking_coward/) that made the post about how hard I was finding it to retire. I wasn't expecting the outpouring of advice that I received from that. I had spent most of my working life dreaming of the day when I could call it quits but when the time finally came I was terrified. I had always figured it would be like graduation from high school. You cross the finish line, toss your cap in the air, and celebrate. Instead I started to see it like attending my own funeral. [This blog post](https://livingafi.com/2015/01/20/midlife-fi-sis/) was an amazing comfort and inspiration for me. If you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and do so. I discovered that, while I was well prepared financially for it,  I was totally unprepared for the emotional side of facing retirement.

I had some deep thoughts to think since that post and I figured that I owed the community an update.  

I shared a lot of my fears with my wife and we talked at length about whether we were ready for this. Her response was ""If we had waited until we were ready to get married, or ready to have kids, we would both still be single and childless. Let's do it."" 

The best suggestions were around looking forward to my new life instead of looking backwards to what I was leaving. This made me do some serious reflection on what was important to me. I started a list of things that I wanted to do as soon as I had free time and came to the realization of how much of my life I had put on hold for work. As these new possibilities opened up for me, the fear dissipated and excitement took over. Then, about a month ago, I ran across a relatively new charity that lit a fire in me. It is still in the growing stages and I will be starting the first chapter in this area. I'm leaving a well paying job in order to work for free as a manager, building a team from scratch, *and I have not been this excited in decades*.

I have set my date and will be a free man in a couple of months, once I wrap up some projects and transition the rest. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank this community for the words of advice and encouragement.

And, in the words of the great philosopher NoLaMess:

>Quit being a pussy old man deaths gonna snatch your ass sooner than you’d like so make it worth it

I'm going to make it worth it, and make some kids lives better in the process.

1250,An unexpected benefit to paying off your mortgage,,600,883bs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/883bs2/an_unexpected_benefit_to_paying_off_your_mortgage/,1522345619.0,"Recently, in mid January, it hit 7 degrees Fahrenheit and we had a pipe burst in an upstairs room. It showered water out of the top of the pipe in spectacular fashion, spraying up into the air and soaking a nearby wall and ceiling. This happened early in the morning while my wife was at work. When she got home, she saw frozen water in the driveway. She went in the house to see water raining down from a can light. She called me and I tried to walk her through turning off the house water, neighbors got involved, I headed home, and the city was called to cut off the water. By the time I got home it was still running, probably for a total of three or four hours before it was discovered and then the city got there. I went upstairs to see the damage, and it turns out the ceiling had collapsed into that room.

I called Dalworth while I was still on the way home, realizing they were about to be very busy when more people got home. They made it out that night and got vacuums and fans going for damage remediation. I called the insurance, Allstate, and they set up an adjuster to come out that week and get started on the estimates of repairs. I selected a contractor and he came out the next day to have a look. The adjuster took a stab at figuring the square footage of our weird floorplan and ultimately gave up and hired her own contractor to figure it all out. The contractor didn't miss a trick.

Damage to actual stuff in the rooms was minimal, about $500. A check was cut the next day after I inventoried everything, and arrived quickly, so this was all wrapped up by the end of January. However, the collapsed ceiling, ruined carpet, and mostly the flooded wood flooring came to almost $30k. The insurance company also quickly cut a check and the contractor began work. Then the trouble began.

Because I have a mortgage with US Bank \(though most modern mortgages work this way now\), they were added as a payee on the insurance check. So it was made out to my wife and I, and US Bank. This meant that to cash it, I had to endorse it, and mail it to US Bank. More specifically, they use something called [InsuranceClaimCheck.com](https://InsuranceClaimCheck.com) as a clearinghouse for this stuff. I had actually had a roof replaced before so I was familiar with how they have to endorse the check and will only pay out a bit at a time as the contractor does the work. However with a specialized clearinghouse involved, this has become a nightmare of Kafkaesque proportions.

There are four different documents they require, in addition to the check itself. Other than the check, you can upload it to their website, so it didn't seem like it would be too bad.

1\) They need an Insurance Adjuster's Worksheet. This was no problem, I sent them what the adjuster had given me, which had a breakdown of all the costs and work to be done.

2\) They needed the contractor's W\-9. So I had to first print out the W\-9 form, and get it to the contractor, who then filled it out and signed it, gave it back to me, so that I could scan it and upload it to the website. So much for the convenience of online.

3\) They needed the contractor's signed contract. This was a bid by the actual contractor. I got that as a PDF from the contractor, so I was able to upload that directly. Convenient, right?

4\) They needed the contractor's waiver of lien from each contractor. This is a document stating that the contractor won't put a lien on the home for any reason other than nonpayment. The mortgage company is trying to protect itself from extra liens, and they control the money, so they are protected. Seems simple enough. The contractor sent me his insurance policy to forward to them. He was pretty responsive and got all this done by mid February.

Well, the mortgage company got specific and wanted the waiver of lien to be their own form filled out by the contractor. Actually, filled out by by all contractors, so I'm glad I used only one and didn't try to sub it out myself. It would have been far cheaper but 10x the hassle. In the mean time they cashed the insurance check and held the funds. It took them something like 8 or 9 business days to indicate that they had even received the check. I sent it by regular mail and I was getting concerned that they were trying to hold the check or that they had not received it properly.

Finally the check was acknowledged online, and I had gotten the document of signed waiver of lien to them, and the status changed from ""waiting for documents"" to ""checks will be disbursed after four business days"". This was a relief because the contractor was well underway and hadn't been paid yet. He's a local small businessman and was out of pocket for significant materials and labor already. I wrote him a check for the deductible to provide some relief.

Then the status changed back to waiting on documents two days later. The contractor's signed contract \(3 above\) was signed by the contractor but apparently we had to sign it too. They called me at dinner to inform me we needed to do this. The call was a bit suspicious to me because it wasn't even a properly formed return number. With 20k plus on the line, I wanted to make sure it was legit, so I checked when I got home and sure enough it showed the information was needed. In the mean time I noticed a weird phone number on the account in addition to mine and my wifes. In the mean time I signed and went to upload the contract again, but had trouble logging in. Red flags going off.  So I called them to make sure some sort of fraud hadn't happened with that phone call the previous night. I asked them to remove the mysterious phone number. I did a google search on the number but it turned out to be the main line at my work \(which I never call or use\). They said they knew their website was having problems. So false alarm on the fraud \(well, read on\). I managed to get the document uploaded finally.

A day or two later, they processed the document, and another day or two later they cut the check, according to their online system. No direct transfer option exists. About four or five days later I get a letter from them in the mail, so I think ""great, the check is finally here"". Mind you it's about two months since the incident at this point, and the contractor is almost finished. The terms of the contract were 1/3 up front, 1/3 when wood floors are finished \(they are\) and 1/3 at the end. All he had seen so far was the deductible, about 1/6 of the total.

But, in fact, the check wasn't here. It was just a note acknowledging the change of phone number. Of course they removed the wrong one, but that's beside the point. Mail doesn't take 6\-7 days to arrive. They hold things, even notifications of security information. Then they lie about it, even if you call them out on it. All so they can hold the check, all so they can continue to draw interest on the money while they sit on it. As of today, 3/29, the check STILL hasn't arrived. I called them and they said I should wait a day or two, and if it still doesn't arrive, they will stop payment and cut me a new one. Work finishes tomorrow.

Pay off your mortgages folks. I plan to accelerate that part of my plan posthaste.

**TL;DR** \- if you pay off your mortgage, you won't have to deal with the mortgage company when an insured event occurs. Mortgage companies have become a massive PITA in this regard.

**Update**: Thanks for all the comments. Check came  in today. What a funny coincidence that it's Good Friday and the check won't clear their books until next quarter.",financialindependence

""If you have something which is truly important to you, do it while you can.""


I know this topic (or various flavours of it) is discussed often within this subreddit, however I found it poignant coming from a completely different source. 

Like several others, I feel I have prioritised saving over spending, perhaps to the detriment of things that I value. 
As a result, this has caused me to begin the process of actually evaluating what is 'truly important', and how I can make these things happen without sacrificing FI or RE principles (which are also important to me).

I've been keeping a 60%-70% savings rate during that time, with a few exceptions here and there. The exceptions often hurt and fill me with anxiety, so I have worked to keep them to a minimum over the years. At the same time, I diligently keep track of my savings across my various bank/brokerage/retirement accounts and track what goes where on a revolving basis.

Over time, I've experienced a feeling of disassociation, in which I feel like my various accounts and I are at odds with each other. It often feels like I need to choose between spending money on me and spending money on my accounts--as if they aren't really mine. This feeling has intensified in the last 2 years.

So this month I cut my savings rate down significantly--down to 30%. I spent a lot more money on entertainment--nice restaurants, bars, travel. And it felt incredibly freeing. I suddenly felt more relaxed, more at ease, and generally happier with life.

This experience has got me rethinking why I am working towards FIRE and how hard I should work towards it. I love my job and have little desire to quit or retire, but I have focused on FIRE nonetheless because I recognize the power of having ""Fuck You"" money and because I don't trust anyone, least of all employers who are financially motivated to minimize their costs, including my income.

This has reminded me of the ""feed the pig"" ad campaign that I saw a few years ago. I think it's easy to see feeding savings as feeding another entity outside of your own, which is partly why many people save little or nothing. It isn't that they are undisciplined or bad at delaying gratification, but just that they don't see their savings as theirs.

My takeaway from this experience is to choose a savings rate that you are comfortable with and, most crucially, allow yourself to abandon that savings rate every once in a while to enjoy life. I think a lot of FIRE bloggers miss this point, urging readers to find cheap/free ways to enjoy life like gardening, going to the library, etc. Well, I like drinking old fashioneds in fancy hotel bars a lot more than I will ever like gardening, and no amount of personal finance posts are going to change that. The key is to keep it within reason, keep saving, and allow yourself to oscillate from periods of high savings to periods of indulgence without feeling like you're failing to execute your plan.

I feel many people here might disagree with this perspective, so I'd love to hear your feedback.",financialindependence

I graduated in 2017 with $74k in debt with no money to my name. When I started working, I started aggressively paying off my debt while living with my parents. I was able to put the majority of my paycheck towards my loans and fund my 401K to get the full match as well as throw some money into my Roth IRA and save a few hundred bucks per month. I was very fortunate to have my parents not only cover my living expenses but they even paid about a third of my debt off. I was in a great position to have that support from my family. I'd like to add that I was making a modest salary of about $58k plus a 10% bonus. I started tracking my net worth and became addicted to paying off my debt and slowly building my nest egg.

May 2017: -$74k NW

Somewhere around the end of 2018, my net worth hit zero. It was a bittersweet feeling because I was glad to be making progress but frustrated that I was just starting from the bottom.

May 2017: -$74k NW

December 2018: $0 NW

Around March of 2019, my debt was completely paid off. This feeling was more exciting than hitting 0 net worth, because I then knew that interest would be totally working in my favor. I also felt like I received a big raise because I didn't have to pay $2.5k per month on my loans. I immediately increased my retirement contributions to pick up the slack in my disposable income. Since then I have been contributing $500 per month to my IRA and $1000 per month to my 401K.

I moved in with my (now) fiance about 3 months ago and have been having conversations with her about FIRE and delayed gratification. She isn't interested in how investments work but she realizes she needs to set money aside for the future. She is still working on her PhD so she has time before she will make money and be able to invest.

Today I just surpassed $30k in my retirement accounts. I finally feel like I have a decent little pile developing. It's not much, but it's a start. I could cover about a year and a half's worth of expenses with those savings. I know that early contributions are what make a big difference down the road. The FIRE journey is a grind but it's rewarding to watch your wealth grow and make progress.

You can see the growth levels off a bit halfway through the year when my parents stopped making payments on my loans and I moved out. Compound interest hasn't made a noticeable impact yet on my worth since I have not had so much time in the market. I am guessing around the $100k mark I might see the magic start happening.

Anyway, yesterday I received the news that I am being promoted. My raise will be about 23% and will put me above the $80k mark including my bonuses. I am still in the process of negotiating it higher (I think I will be able to, given my performance reviews). I am ecstatic. My hard work is paying off. I am really looking forward to greater responsibilities and the growth that will come as a result. My plan is to try to fully fund my IRA and 401K while continuing to save for a house. Hopefully within a year or 2 I'll be able to purchase my first property.

I hope this post shows some people that not everyone here is making 6 figures, worth half a million in their 20s. I am still privileged to have had the luxury of living at home with my parents while paying off my debt, but this perspective may be easier to relate to as a mid level earner.

1258,For those who feel behind on their FIRE journey,,595,a50fmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/a50fmt/for_those_who_feel_behind_on_their_fire_journey/,1544480078.0,"I'm sure seeing the ""I'm 28 with 1.1MM in the bank"" posts make you feel pretty bad if you compare yourself. Well here's a post from the completely opposite side.

I consider myself fairly conservative with my spending and had high hopes of FIRE when in college. I was given every advantage and opportunity thanks to the financial support of my parents and I weep for people who made the same decisions as I did without such support.

My college tuition and graduate school tuition were completely paid for and I was only responsible for living expenses. Someone who did not have the financial assistance I did would be looking at about 200K in debt. Unfortunately, it seems the earning potential with the advanced degree has largely declined or stagnated and the cost of the grad degree (time + money) could not be justified at this time. You can expect to earn $50k post-grad in this field with the industry average around 75k. The top 1% of the field may earn 250-300k but that is obviously not common. Additionally, in order to break into the top earning bracket in this field, you must open your own business which of course comes with more cost, and risk.

I worked in a position for 3 years earning 50k a year and saved about 12k. During my last year I got engaged and spent about 5k on a ring. I even tried to be practical and buy a lab-created diamond which may be more economical, isn't really very significant savings. I was then let go from that position.

With 7k in savings and my 3 years knowledge about the industry, I figured there's no better time than now to start my own business. It's the only way to really break out of the mold and make significant earnings. I got a 50k bank loan and spent 25k on buying the assets of an existing business and opened up shop.

I've been in business about 9 months now and things aren't going great. I've depleted my savings almost entirely to pay my bills at home and my business barely breaks even. I spend most of my time outside of the office marketing, networking, setting up meetings, and it all seems like a wasted effort due to having no tangible effect on my bottom line. I've never worked harder to earn less in my life. They say that the first year in business is hardest and that it will grow with time, but I don't know how much longer I can sustain before I go into debt. And this is coming from the guy who was given every opportunity and advantage. I would cry if I additionally had 200K in debt. Or maybe I would just know that is a debt I would take to the grave.

As depressing as this post sounds I'm not depressed and I am still hopeful for the future and am continuing to work hard to make my business successful. I just want people out there to know that despite planning and thinking you are making the most prudent decisions on your pathway to financial independence, life may have other plans!",financialindependence
1259,I got rid of my internet and now will save approximately $960 per year,,596,axgycu,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/axgycu/i_got_rid_of_my_internet_and_now_will_save/,1551760291.0,"So I've done the unthinkable. Something I didn't think in a million years I'd do but I've decided to get rid of my internet line. I was paying around $80 per month and it basically gave me everything I needed (1000GB and 100mb/s) except my phone plan also had around 40GB of data each month. So I weighed up in my mind if I really need the internet on at my house and realised I don't actually use it all that often except YouTube and Netflix. Netflix is already included in my phone plan so it doesn't chew into my 40GB and I can work on living without Youtube. So to me thats pretty much a win!  


Has anyone made similar decisions and if so, how's it going for you so far?",financialindependence
1260,Hit 1.5 million today,,598,ar6fkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ar6fkr/hit_15_million_today/,1550300783.0,"&#x200B;

My net worth in mint hit 1.5 million today.  I am 44 years old and didn't start seriously thinking about FI until my late 30's.  I had been pretty much expanding my lifestyle with every expansion of my income to that point.  But I decided enough was enough, and started auto-deducting every raise I've received since then.  Some into retirement accounts, some into savings, some into a brokerage account.  I've been able to do that with every raise ever since, and frankly, it made all the difference.  Set it and forget it, and I've never missed the money.

&#x200B;

I don't expect to walk away from my job until I hit 55.  Not exactly early retirement, but there's a good reason for it.  I'm in a pension system and anything younger would really short change my pension income when I ""retire"".  In fact, there's an age factor multiplier that makes it very tempting to stay past 55.  But I want every day from 55 on to be a \*choice\* that I'm staying because I want to, not because I ""have to"".  It's still a long slog ahead of me.  I still have two kids to put through college.  I have to keep everybody in the family healthy.  Everything has to continue to go right.  But I feel like I'm well on my way.

&#x200B;

I have roughly $800k (net) in real estate, $500k in stocks/bonds, and $200k in cash/t-bills.  The real estate is between two single family homes, one of which I rent out.  Most of the stocks/bonds are in retirement accounts.  I'm stockpiling cash because I'm thinking about expanding the real estate portfolio, especially if there's a correction in the near future.

&#x200B;

If I have one tip, if you have a stable career, pick a lifestyle level which is comfortable for you, then have a policy that you'll autodeduct any raises as the years go by into investments.  It works.

1261,How is FI possible for someone with a regular job?,,595,80dr3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/80dr3v/how_is_fi_possible_for_someone_with_a_regular_job/,1519658541.0,"I'm a long time lurker and  I'm not working towards FI. But my fiance and I we've been working towards our mortgage deposit for the last 4-5 years. We've managed to save decent amount of money but by looking at some of yours FI targets it's not even a 1/30th of some of your targets. 

I have an ok'ish job in London and she's a teacher both on ok salary but the cost or living and everything else in London is so high it took as nearly 5 years to save enough for the deposit for the mortgage and we won't even be able to buy anything in London as we won't be able to afford it despite being very frugal for the last 5 years. We'll have to buy something outside London, and by observing my friend and colleagues is still a great achievement in my opinion because people do struggle big time to save enough money for a house deposit. Some of my friends will probably never be able to do it and some of them will live with their parents forever. 

I've come to a conclusion that FIRE is pretty much impossible for us, we would have to work and save for at least another 25 years so we may as well keep doing what we are doing now and keep buying properties and work till we 65+ and then live off of the rent from two or more properties that we manage to pay off before we retire, our minimum target is one for us and two more that we can buy to rent. 

Feels like FIRE is accessible only to people on a really good salary or enterpreneurs that can save a lot every month from runing their own business. Saving towards FIRE on a regular salary in UK is almost impossible.
